There is a high degree of external involvement in the humantrafficking market, which is driven primarily by criminal networks originating in Niger, which is also the country of origin of most trafficking victims in Algeria. Algeria is a transit country for individuals travelling towards Europe, and extortion and other exploitative practices are common occurrences on migrants\u2019 journeys. Labour standards and regulatory capacity in Algeria are poor, and therefore instances of exploitative and bonded labour are common and largely unremarked upon. Irregular migrants from sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable to exploitation. However, this tends to occur on an ad-hoc basis, or with local groups and businesses, rather than as a systematic form of transnational organized crime. ##&& Human smuggling is a dynamic, long-standing but increasingly risky market in Algeria, a country that is both a destination and a transit country for irregular migrants. Over the past two years, increasing numbers of migrants have been making the sea crossing from coastal points in Algeria towards Spain. Human-smuggling networks operate along Algeria\u2019s southern borders.The migrant smuggling hub of Tamanrasset,in particular,is an important transit site for migrants journeying towards Morocco and Libya, with migrants crossing from Mali and Niger. Border officials are known to collaborate in the illicit market, and despite harsh rhetoric and strict enforcement measures employed by the government, including the construction of a sand berm to counter human smuggling, this environment has empowered violent and specialized networks which operate across multiple routes in central Sahara. Algeria\u2019s securitization efforts and crackdown on human smuggling generate greater opportunities for smuggling networks as the demand to reach Algeria remains high, despite a temporary slowdown during the COVID-19 pandemic.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking is a thriving market in southern Algeria due to the outflows from neighbouring Mali and Libya. Seizures of large stocks of small and light weapons are a regular occurrence. The Salvador pass in Niger, at the convergence with Libya and Algeria, is situated at a strategic corridor for traffickers and is considered a primary transit point. The mostimportant corridor for arms trafficking connects the city of Djanet in the southeast to Bordj Baji Mokhtar in the southwest. To a lesser extent, a network of arms trafficking also exists between Algeria and Tunisia. Although this market is smaller thanthat of Niger and Libya, the presence of terrorist groups around Mount Chaambi at the Tunisia\u2013Algeria border, where heavy armed conflict has occurred in the past years, is significant.","text - environment":"Although illegal logging of cedar and fir by local people is common in neighbouring countries, there is no evidence to suggest the presence of organized criminal activity pertaining to flora in Algeria. However, thousands of animal species in the country are in danger of extinction as a result of poaching and trafficking, including gazelles, the bearded mouflon and a number of rare bird species, in particular goldfinches. Actors from various Gulf countries play an important role in the fauna crimes market in Algeria, in both the poaching and the purchasing of animal trophies. ##&& The most pervasive environmental criminal market, however, is that of non-renewable resources crimes. Algeria experiences high levels of oil smuggling, the value of which is estimated at more than a billion dollars per year. Algeria is an oil-rich country where fuel is extensively subsidized. As a consequence, due to large price differentials, massive quantities of oil are diverted to neighbouring countries, primarily Tunisia, but also Morocco, Mali, Niger and Mauritania, through local smuggling networks. While oil-smuggling activity in the country is geographically limited, the net loss for Algerian people overall is immense, in part due to the widespread cronyism that culminates in substantial losses to the public purse.In recent times, gold trafficking has become increasingly prevalent in the far south of Algeria. However, with mobility restrictions and the closure of borders due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this activity experienced a temporary slowdown.","text - drugs":"Algeria\u2019s most pervasive drug market is cannabis. While cannabis cultivation in Algeria is low, criminal networks involved in the cannabis trade have longstanding regional connections with their Moroccan counterparts, and Algeria is a major destination and transit market for Moroccan cannabis.The supply chain is composed of a limited number of major players, hundreds of wholesalers across the country and thousands of smaller trafficking networks commercializing cannabis to the endconsumer.Furthermore, over the past two years, authorities have seized increasingly sizeable quantities of cannabis at the country\u2019s southern borders. ##&& While less pervasive than the cannabis trade, Algeria\u2019s synthetic-drug market is growing at a fast pace. Algeria has turned, fairly rapidly, from an origin point for smuggled synthetics to a destination country and is considered the largest market in North Africa. Tramadol and codeine smuggling dominate the market, but Subutex also plays an important role.Although the illicit trade was originally limited to urban hubs such as Algiers and Oran, the market has expanded across most of the country over the past two years. Conversely, the cocaine and heroin markets only have a limited influence in Algeria, although there is evidence to suggest that both markets may be experiencing an uptick in activity in recent times. For cocaine in particular, Algeria is emerging as a new and significant trafficking hub linking Latin American cocaine production sites with drug markets in Europe.","text - criminal actors":"Criminal networks are among the most active, geographically widespread, and economically dominant criminal actors in Algeria. Criminal networks with significant transnational linkages are involved in long-standing hashish-trafficking activities, the smuggling of basic products(particularlyalong the southern border of the country), the illicit trafficking of oil, human smuggling, the illicit gold trade and arms trafficking. These transnational networks are highly active in Algeria\u2019s northern city hubs, such as Algiers, Annaba and Oran, but alsoin cities such as Marseille and Paris.Historically, foreign actors played a role more akin to \u2018interfaces\u2019 or \u2018intermediaries\u2019 rather than immediate controllers, exerting moderate to substantial degrees of economic and financial power in domestic criminal markets. However, there is increasing evidence of foreign actors who are physically present in the country, particularly in the south, engaged in illegal gold extraction. While not necessarily exerting full control of these markets, foreign criminal actors, including Nigerien, Malian and Libyan nationals, take part in four major markets: food and oil trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, gold trafficking, and arms trafficking. Such actors are concentrated and often established in Tamanrasset and the borderlands of Timiaouine and In Guezzam. ##&& Despite the prevalence of criminal networks, both domestic and foreign, the most pervasive criminal actor type in Algeria is the state-embedded actor. Corruption in Algeria remains so pervasive that high-level criminal actors have been increasingly linked to state institutions. Such actors continue to enjoy a high level of protection from the state, while high-level politicians and military elites have been associated with massive money-laundering, tax-evasion and embezzlements cases.The 2018 scandal known as \u2018cocainegate\u2019 offered a glimpse of the extent to which high-ranking officials and businessmen are connected within criminal economies.","text - leadership and governance":"Algeria is the main security power in the region and is often labelled as a stabilizing force. It maintains strong law enforcement and military leadership against transnational organized crime. The security apparatus connects the fight against organized crime and the fight against terrorism. This translates into a tough on-the-ground approach to criminal networks, with the fight against organized crime embedded in the country\u2019s counterterrorism strategy,relying primarily on border securitization and prosecution. However, high levels of corruption, impunity and lack of transparency are significant issues in Algeria.There is little evidence to suggest that the end of the regime of former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika and the transition to the new government of Abdelmadjid Tebboune has brought about any material change to levels of transparency and accountability.Indeed, the purported objectives of increasing transparency and accountability by way of the new constitution have failed to win over the protesters of the Hirak movement and significant sections of the population. ##&& On the whole, adequate standards and systems for international cooperation are in place. Algeria is party to all relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, with the exception of the Arms Trade Treaty. At the continental level, Algeria has been leading the implementation of AFRIPOL, the African Union police cooperation mechanism. However, information-sharing related to high-level tax evasion cases or common judicial trials is low, and the near complete lack of cooperation with Morocco is a serious gap, given that the shared border hosts a large variety of criminal markets.Domestically, Algeria has extremely tough and punitive laws on organized crime, including on drugs, human and arms trafficking and human smuggling. However, there is no clear political vision on how to effectively tackle the challenges of organized crime, nor a consolidated strategy to combat the rise of criminal economies. New legislation adopted in September 2020 ostensibly with the purpose of tackling bandes de quartiers (gangs) is viewed by many as a way of strengthening the judicial arsenal against groups acting as important driving forces behind the Hirak movement.","text - criminal justice and security":"Maintaining territorial integrity is one of the highest priorities of the Algerian government, as evidenced by its heavy emphasis on law enforcement and militarization responses to organized crime, in particular at the country\u2019s southern borders. Law enforcement personnel are well trained, and the police\u2019s special investigation crime unit has strong operational capacities.Nevertheless, the vastness of Algerian territory is such that full control of the country\u2019s borders is impossible, in particular in light of the contiguity with conflict-torn states to the south and east. Security forces\u2019 tolerance for informal cross-border activities has steadily decreased in recent times, particular in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic,which has adversely affected borderland communities. The judicial system in Algeria is extremely weak in comparison to the country\u2019s law-enforcement apparatus. There are high levels of government interference in the judiciary and recent evidence suggests a significantly limited ability on the part of the judicial system to bring high-level organized crime figures to trial. Furthermore, physical and other forms of abuse are widespread within the detention system.","text - economic and financial environment":"The state has a strong grip on the economy in Algeria, which is supported by significant protectionist policies. However, the country is on the verge of an economic crisis, largely as a result of falling oil prices. The seemingly politically motivated arrests of many business people in Bouteflika\u2019s inner circle have further exacerbated the economic volatility in Algeria. The government has shown limited capacity to exert control over the informal economy, which accounts for more than half of the overall economy. Excessive bureaucracy makes engaging in the formal economy difficult, which, when combined with a general lack of avenues toward prosperity for most Algerians, presents optimal opportunities for informal practices, illicit trade and numerous black markets. With regard to the anti-money laundering framework, while established systems of reporting through financial intelligence units exist, they have been ineffective in blocking capital flight.There is little evidence to suggest any of the relevant institutions have sought to tackle the primary means of laundering money in Algeria\u2013 the property market.In December 2020, the government did, however, establish a committee tasked with developing a national anti-money laundering strategy, among other objectives.","text - civil society and social protection":"Civil society and social protection measures are extremely weak in Algeria. Accessing effective treatment and support is very difficult for people who use drugs, and the country meets only a small fraction of the necessary measures to help victims exit modern slavery. Although there is a national anti-trafficking plan in place, its implementation is slow, largely due to the fact that there are no public mechanisms to screen, identify and refer potential victims to protection services. With regard to the prevention of organized crime, measures are in place but fall considerably short of the necessary standards. The majority of organized-crime prevention measures fall under the remit of law enforcement agencies in the country, focusing primarily on drug-related crimes. ##&& While civil society in Algeria is dynamic and vocal, it is at the mercy of an authoritarian regime. The state has undermined civil-society groups with severe restrictions in terms of funding and capacity. The legal space in which such groups can operate is shrinking. The authorities often use vague legislation such as that pertaining to \u2018demoralizing the army\u2019 and \u2018undermining national unity\u2019 to repress independent media, and crackdowns on the freedom of the press have only escalated since the birth of the Hirak movement in February 2019.At the end of 2020 there were about 60 political prisoners in detention, several of whom are journalists.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Algiers","GDP (current $US million)":"171091.29","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"43053054","Land Area (sq. km)":"2381741","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"73.6","Freedom in the World Index":"32","Human Development Index":"0.75","Global Peace Index":"2.29","Democracy Index":"3.77","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"36","GDP per capita (current US$)":"3974","1":"4.52","1.1":"4.65","1.2":"4.38","2":"4.63"},{"Corresp":"5","ISO-3":"AGO","Country":"Angola","ISO-2":"AO","Continent":"Africa","Region":"Central Africa","Flag file":"ao.png","1.

Domestically, Angolans are trafficked into the construction, agriculture, prostitution and diamond mining industries, while minors are forced into criminal activity. Angolans are also trafficked into South Africa, Namibia, Portugal and the Netherlands, as forced labour, and to transport illicit goods as part of a scheme to avoid import fees with Namibia. Foreign women engaged in prostitution within Angola may well be victims of trafficking, alongside Chinese women, who are recruited by Chinese gangs with the promise of paid work, and subsequently forced into both modern slavery and prostitution. Given the rise in trafficking, it is likely that human smuggling efforts are also increasing in parallel. Foreign nationals seeking labour opportunities in Angola often solicit the services of smugglers, in particular from the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).","text - trade":"Firearm and ammunition smuggling is high, with the demand for weapons coming from Angolan secessionists in the oil-rich exclave province of Cabinda, and which are often supplied from within the DRC. It is believed that many arms, leftover from the civil war, are still in circulation, although authorities claim that the increasing age and obsolescence of these arms make them easier to control. There have been reports about private security company personnel, who are authorized to carry weapons, trafficking these arms to local criminal networks.","text - environment":"Illegal logging, predominantly performed by Chinese companies working with Angolan counterparts, is concerning, with Angola losing 5.2% of its tree cover since 2000. Chinese companies export this timber from Angolan ports to nearby Namibia as well as Asia. Illegal logging is carried out by unauthorized fellers, and by concession holders exceeding their licenses. Deforestation has increased by 50% in the last five years, and as a result, there are no longer any natural forests in the country. ##&& Fauna crimes are a major concern for the Angolan authorities, with poaching's estimated market value reaching \u20ac220 million in 2017. There is considerable ivory and rhino horn being trafficked into Asian markets, with 1.2 tonnes of ivory and other parts seized from poachers in 2017. Conservation areas are poorly policed, and hunting is inadequately regulated. The illicit market for endangered species, like the pangolin, is growing, as these animals are trafficked through Luanda International Airport. The bushmeat market also has concerning levels of wildlife for sale, while the levels of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing have affected the country\u2019s marine life. ##&& Angola is rich in minerals and oil, and as a result there is extensive trafficking of illicit diamonds and cross-border fuel and gold smuggling activities. Angola\u2019s oil and diamond fields are exploited by corrupt elites to enrich themselves. The diamond industry and mining areas are tightly controlled by the military and private security companies making it impossible for outside criminal networks to operate without the collusion of military personnel.","text - drugs":"Angola is a significant cocaine trafficking hub, acting as a trans-shipment country for South American cocaine destined for southern and West African countries as well as markets in Europe and the Middle East. The country\u2019s shared language with Brazil, Mozambique and Portugal has promoted close ties between actors facilitating the cocaine trade in these countries. Cocaine also travels by land into Namibia and other bordering landlocked countries. There is ongoing state involvement, through corrupt and compromised officials, as well as through its military bodies, in supporting the trade. The state also has a role in facilitating the laundering of illicit financial flows related to drug trafficking. Local consumption of crack cocaine in particular, is high, and it is the second most consumed drug in the country, most commonly sourced from Brazil. ##&& Cannabis is grown both locally and sourced from South Africa and Namibia and is the most consumed and commercialized illicit drug in the country and police claim to have destroyed 23 000 cannabis plantations in 2019. The other drug markets are less pervasive in Angola, as there is little evidence to indicate a substantial presence of synthetic drugs, with no seizures in the last five years. However, Angola is reportedly a transit point for methamphetamine manufactured in Nigeria and destined for South Africa. Finally, the heroin market has very little influence, although evidence suggests that the country is becoming a growing transit state for Afghan heroin moving towards Europe.","text - criminal actors":"Small mafia-style groups are emerging in Angola, often in urban centres such as Luanda, usually operating across multiple criminal markets. There is a worrying collaboration between thieves and banks, where people withdrawing large sums of money have been targeted and attacked. These criminal groups have access to weapons left over from the civil war and weapons from corrupt security companies. The weak police presence in poor urban neighbourhoods may account for the emergence of these groups, and levels of violence are extremely high. The mafia-style groups do not appear to have strong control over territories yet, as no levies or extortion activities have been reported. Angolan organized criminal groups are involved in many criminal markets, but typically in wildlife trafficking and forestry, to which they bring violence, insecurity, environmental and economic damage. They receive protection from police officers, and their activity is increasing. ##&& State-embedded actors continue to constitute a major threat, as the anti-corruption efforts implemented by President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o have brought to light numerous serious cases of fraud and other financial crimes. These include the case against the former president\u2019s daughter, Isabel Dos Santos, who faces charges of embezzlement and money laundering. The charges against Dos Santos were announced by the prosecutor general of Angola at a press conference in January 2020. Dos Santos is yet to stand trial but has denied all allegations of wrongdoing. Several other business leaders and senior government officials are facing similar charges and some have already been convicted of money laundering. It is believed that the financial crimes perpetrated by state-embedded actors remain significant, and some believe the current prosecutions, while high profile, are selective and won\u2019t substantially alter the current structure of state capture. Indeed, state-embedded actors are overwhelmingly the most powerful criminal actors in the Angolan organized crime landscape. ##&& With regard to foreign criminal actors, the most pervasive are nationals from the DRC who are involved in the illegal diamond mining industry. Furthermore, Chinese syndicates are involved in a number of different criminal markets, notably illegal logging and wildlife trafficking, as well as human trafficking. In 2016, the Chinese mafia was responsible for increased violence in Luanda and cases of kidnapping rose dramatically, targeting primarily Chinese nationals, often businesspeople, resident in the country.","text - leadership and governance":"On taking office in 2017, President Louren\u00e7o quickly made clear his ambition to fight money laundering, nepotism and corruption, commencing prosecutions against former government officials for serious embezzlement and fraud crimes. The president's anti-corruption efforts have been successful so far, and he appears to have broken the corrupt structures of Angola\u2019s political system. There has been closer collaboration with the UNODC to fight organized crime, and a new penal code has been introduced targeting financial and environmental crimes. While this is encouraging, there is a long way to go and public trust in the government remains low. Despite marked improvements, the institutional anti-corruption framework remains insufficient, and government transparency and accountability is poor. Access to information is unsatisfactory and Angola does not meet international standards on the transparency of its budgets and the spending practices of public institutions. Nevertheless, notable improvements have been made with the rewriting of the penal code regarding access to information. The country has also indicated its intention to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative to improve transparency in its mining activities. ##&& Angola has ratified nine international legal instruments to combat organized crime and is a party to the UNTOC and its three protocols. Extradition agreements are in place with Portugal and Brazil, the two main countries in which Angolan elites launder their money. In addition, efforts have been made by Angola, along with its neighbouring countries, to combat wildlife crimes. While there have been encouraging steps towards greater international cooperation, Angola is yet to ratify international protocols around arms trafficking. Domestically, Angola\u2019s legislative framework relating to organized crime is relatively robust, with the most notable criminal markets legislated, this includes the 2011 and 2014 laws combating money laundering and terrorist financing. In 2020, the new government created an independent special office to combat corruption and human trafficking.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judiciary is not independent in Angola and suffers inappropriate executive control. The president nominates justices for each court and the executive has rewarded compliant judges with favourable paid positions as chairs of committees. There is also a shortage of trained judges and lawyers, however the current president has pledged to increase the human resources capacity in the judiciary. Prisons in Angola are overcrowded, and many inmates are denied their basic human rights. The police are challenged in their effectiveness as they are understaffed and plagued by corruption. In 2018, the police force launched Operation Transparency and Operation Rescue aiming to rectify these issues and reduce the main factors that contribute to organized crime. Angolan law enforcement works with South Africa, Brazil and Portugal to fight cocaine trafficking and its officers receive training and equipment from South African authorities. Notably, the NGO Human Rights Watch continues to register concerns about police impunity, arbitrary arrests and extra-judicial killings. ##&& Angola\u2019s extensive borders and long coastline are difficult to police. Nevertheless, the border police systematically carry out operations to combat cross-border crimes. Drugs, ivory and wildlife are also fairly regularly seized at the country\u2019s primary airport. It has, however been noted that there is not enough staff or resources to stop smugglers facilitating irregular migration across the border. Angolan citizens and border guards sometimes facilitate criminal organizations\u2019 smuggling and trafficking of people across the border. However, Angolan and Congolese authorities are working together in border operations, especially around the illegal diamond mining trade. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, border agencies have been reinforced, receiving additional support, resulting in a fairly successful border control system.","text - economic and financial environment":"Angola is one of the most difficult countries in the world in which to do business, with poor land and property rights, alongside high levels of institutionalized corruption. The president has begun efforts to restore investor confidence by prioritizing anti-corruption and calling for the restructuring of state-owned enterprises, which has received international attention. Angola\u2019s banking system is vulnerable to corrupt elites which has lowered business confidence further, and the reality remains that political connections are generally needed to expand a business in the country. Furthermore, the oil price shock in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic put a considerable strain on the Angolan economy. ##&& Despite the president achieving a number of high-profile prosecutions against former officials for money laundering offences, these do not necessarily reflect significant increases in the government\u2019s capacity to counteract money laundering, and may be driven more by political motives. Angola is acutely vulnerable to money laundering and US$17 billion has been funnelled out of the country by corrupt networks of government officials and European banks in the last five years. However, a new 2020 law has placed much higher scrutiny over financial transactions made by politicians. Still, despite recent improvements, the legal infrastructure remains inadequate and only partially compliant to international standards.","text - civil society and social protection":"Angola meets only a third of the international mechanisms agreed on to support victims exiting modern slavery. However, it has improved its efforts to support victims of trafficking, including having all identified trafficking victims referred to care in 2019, as well as an increase in funding. In 2020, Angola passed a law to create a witness protection programme, but nothing has been established yet. There are also national and community level rehabilitation services for people who use drugs. ##&& In 2018, Operation Transparency was launched to prevent the illegal extraction of diamonds and to eliminate sources of funding for international terrorism. The new penal code explicitly combats financial, fauna and flora crimes. Angola has also deepened its cooperation with the UNODC seeking support in the form of training and expertise and has done the same with the US treasury in an attempt to better combat financial crimes and corruption. ##&& Despite improvements made under the current leadership, freedom of the press is still limited, with ongoing criminal defamation laws leading to the censorship of journalists. Civil society has been granted more leeway in recent years, however it remains weak, its protest actions are often suppressed, and it has an antagonistic relationship with the Angolan government.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Luanda","GDP (current $US million)":"88815.70","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"31825295","Land Area (sq. km)":"1246700","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"89","Freedom in the World Index":"31","Human Development Index":"0.58","Global Peace Index":"2.09","Democracy Index":"3.66","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"27","GDP per capita (current US$)":"2791","1":"5.29","1.1":"5.20","1.2":"5.38","2":"4.42"},{"Corresp":"19","ISO-3":"BEN","Country":"Benin","ISO-2":"BJ","Continent":"Africa","Region":"West Africa","Flag file":"bj.png","1.

Opportunistic, rather than organized, traffickers move victims, mainly women and children, from the impoverished northern regions to the urban south. Foreign victims trafficked into the country are mainly from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and victims moved out of Benin, usually children trafficked into domestic servitude, are predominantly exploited in West and Central Africa. ##&& Migrant smuggling into and out of Benin has increased, with the country becoming a waypoint for irregular migrants from West and Central Africa, and to a lesser extent for Beninese citizens leaving the country. Nigerian smuggling networks reportedly use Benin as an operations hubwhere falsified travel documents can be obtained. Smuggling usually takes place along the border with Nigeria and is organized by criminal gangs. It is mostly characterized as low level, low profit and broadly non-violent. ","text - trade":"Arms trafficking has dramatically increased, and Benin is now a major transit point for weapons. Domestic ownership of firearms has increased fourfold in ten-year period from 2007 to 2017. The country\u2019s instability, particularly since 2019, and the threat from domestic terrorist groups have contributed to the growing levels of arms trafficking within the country. The threat posed by Boko Haram in the region has also likely affected illicit flows of arms, leading to a growth in the flow of small arms into Benin.","text - environment":"Despite considerable investment by the international community, Benin is experiencing a high level of deforestation, having lost 22% of its forests since 2000. The illicit trade of rosewood into China remains the most pervasive practice, with criminal actors enjoying political protection from business, law enforcement and politicians. Forest governance is poor, and the data collected and published is suspicious and thought to underreport the level of deforestation and illegal felling taking place. There is also an illegal fauna crimes market, which see the trade of endangered and rare species between Benin and China. While an increase in elephants in Benin is encouraging, pangolin poaching remains an enormous threat to the species. Benin has become more vulnerable to external shocks, including climate hazards, the price fluctuations of oil and cotton and occurrencesin Nigeria, Benin's primary trading partner. Due to its high cost in Benin, fuel is smuggled in from Nigeria by criminal networks working near the border and there is also a concern that the country plays a part in the illicit gold trade.","text - drugs":"High levels of corruption make Benin vulnerable to cocaine trafficking flows. It is a known transit hub for South American cocaine supplying European markets, with Cotonou Airport considered an important transit point for the Andean drug. Notably, in 2019, a shipment of 4.4 tonnes of cocaine was seized in Montevideo, Uruguay, bound for Cotonou,and with an estimated street value of $1billion on the European market. Violence does not often accompany the illegal trade. Similarly, Benin is a known transit hub for heroin being moved through Africa, destined for the European markets. It is likely that heroin entering Africa via Kenya is trafficked through Benin by land or continental air routes, however, domestic consumption of heroin remains low.The US Department of State has noted the prevalence of drug trafficking within Benin and the UN has labelled Cotonou Airport a significant drug transit point. ##&& Cannabis is the only drug produced locally in Benin, though mostly on a small scale. The proximity of Benin\u2019s capital, Porto-Novo, to its border with Nigeria allows traffickers in the city to deal directly with Nigerian syndicates. In 2018, there were seizures of cannabis moving from Nigeria\u2019s Edo province into Benin indicating a possible cross-border trade route through West Africa. Nevertheless, low levels of violence are associated with the cannabis trade and local consumption is relatively small. Benin is a minor but growing transit country for synthetic drugs, and its port of Cotonou is the main entry point for much of the tramadol that enters West Africa, while methamphetamineis brought into the country from Nigeria and the DRC. Corruption is also essential for this market, as was demonstrated in 2018, when seven executives and one member of Parliament were arrested for their role in smuggling synthetic drugs, while Benin\u2019s official pharmacy body was suspended for six months after being implicated in the trading of illicit synthetic products.","text - criminal actors":"Foreign actors, particularly from Nigeria, are particularly wellestablished in Benin\u2019s criminal markets, especially drug trafficking. Congolese human trafficking syndicates are also present in Benin, moving Beninese victims into the DRC,and Chinese criminal groups are heavily involved in the rosewood and illicit fauna markets.Benin is also increasingly being targeted by criminal networks from Nigeria, Ghana and other African regions, alongside South American criminals building networks at its ports. At the same time, collusion between domestic criminal networks and the state is growing. While organized hierarchies are usually absent, the cultural homogeneity of border communities, mainly Yoruba, helps facilitate cooperation in illicit cross-border activity between Benin and Nigeria. These networks generally enable the fuel, drugs and environmental markets. ##&& Corruption is high within Benin, and bribery and patronage networks are commonplace, serving as obstacles in the proper functioning of law enforcement and the judiciary. The theft and diversion of public funds is also widespread, while the laws criminalizing corruption are poorly implemented and enforced. The collusion between state actors and criminal networks is particularly established in the smuggling of illicit flora and fauna. There is currently no evidence of mafia-style groups operating in the country.","text - leadership and governance":"Democracy and the separation of powers is guaranteed in Benin, however,state institutions are weak in practice and subject to political manipulation. Although faring better compared to its neighbours, political stability in Benin is threatened,and the government has shown little will to curb existing organized crime. The disputed 2019 legislative elections created high political tensions, and no opposition parties are represented in Parliament as they were either prevented from standing or boycotted the election. Amnesty International has reported concernsabout the growing repression of dissident voices in Benin.Transparency and accountability are poor in the country and there are fears that with the re-election of Patrice Talon in 2021, transparency and checks on the president'spower will be further eroded. The president has already interfered inappropriately with government institutions by attempting to change their electoral regulations. While Benin performs better than its neighbours with regard to transparent governance, it is poor by global standards. ##&& Benin is party to all major international treaties pertaining to organized crime. Yetthe country\u2019s capacity and willingness to implement and enforce these measures is lacking. However, locally there appears to be no hostility between Benin and its neighbours, and its rhetoric with Nigeria, an important trade companion, is constructive and cooperative. Benin also has joint programmes in place with the US,directed at drugs, that have improved the country\u2019s ability to combat drug trafficking. The country\u2019s national legal framework against organized crime remains inadequate and there is little capacity and willingness to improve it. There is no record of any clear national strategies to address organized crime, and the weakness of current legal regulations allows for significant smuggling and trafficking flows to persist.","text - criminal justice and security":"Benin\u2019s judicial system is weak and ineffective, burdened by insufficient funding and corruption. Political interference is inappropriate, and the president increasingly appoints his own judges. The delays and high costs of the justice system ensure the prevalence of mob justice with many criminals able to escape legal sanctions through corruption. The newly established terrorism courts in the country are also massively misused to prosecute people on terrorism charges. Beninese prisons are overcrowded and inmates are denied basic human rights.Law enforcement capacity has improved, following joint training and information sharing with the US as well as the merging of the police force and the gendarmerie to create the Republican Police. There have been notable arrests related to drug and human trafficking, however, these don\u2019t seem to have had an overall effect on criminal activity. Despite some improvements, corruption is still widespread among law enforcement and public trust in the institution is low. ##&& Benin\u2019s borders with Niger, Nigeria and Burkina Faso are porous and these countries pose a substantial threat to national security with the overspill of terrorism, as was seen in 2020 when a police border post was attacked near Burkina Faso. Arguably, the 16-month closure of the Benin\u2013Nigeria border that ended in December 2020 drastically curtailed the flow of arms and criminal and terrorist groups have had their supply networks restricted.","text - economic and financial environment":"Benin is among the countries that suffer the highest risks of money laundering and terrorist financing globally, facilitated predominantly through the purchasing of real estate and by way of casinos. The regulation of cash transactions is weak, and Benin\u2019s underdeveloped financial system limits its ability to combat money laundering. However, new legislation concerning information sharing and the development of a financial intelligence unit is seeing improvements. Benin\u2019s economic regulatory environment is poor, and it is not conducive to doing business. A lack of employment opportunitieshas expanded certain criminal markets such as fuel and oil smuggling,as well as environmental crimes. Conflict and instability have weakened Benin's economic regulatory capacity, but efforts are being made to strengthen this through domestic policy measures and foreign technical and financial support.","text - civil society and social protection":"Some efforts have been made to enhance support for victims of organized crime, especially child victims, but this often comes at the expense of responsibility towards adults. There are few measures in place for the treatment of drug addiction, prisoner rehabilitation or legal employment opportunities, and Benin only has a third of the international interventions in placethat support the exit from modern slavery. Although Benin appears receptive to collaboration with neighbouring countries, such as Nigeria, to strengthen efforts to stem cross-border crimes, national prevention efforts are almost non-existent and curbing organized crime does not appear to be a priority for the government. Civil society is reasonably healthy with organizations such as Social Watch Benin setting up working groups and drafting reports on social, economic and environmental governance. However, there has been a worrying shift recently where changes to the penal code have suppressed criticism of the government and seen an increase in arbitrary arrests of activists and journalists. The introduction of the new Digital Code has restricted press freedom and created a repressive media environment. While there were no human rights violations against journalists in 2019 the actions of the government in this area are concerning, with all of the above issues contributing to Benin\u2019s significantly worsening media landscape.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Porto Novo","GDP (current $US million)":"14390.71","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"11801151","Land Area (sq. km)":"114760","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"72.8","Freedom in the World Index":"65","Human Development Index":"0.55","Global Peace Index":"2.18","Democracy Index":"4.58","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"41","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1219","1":"5.25","1.1":"5.25","1.2":"5.25","2":"3.54"},{"Corresp":"23","ISO-3":"BWA","Country":"Botswana","ISO-2":"BW","Continent":"Africa","Region":"Southern Africa","Flag file":"bw.png","1.

Most vulnerable are those from poor, rural areas and undocumented migrant children from Zimbabwe, though it remains a limited and minor market. Migrant smuggling is also a small market in Botswana, with the country usually serving as a destination for political and economic refugees from neighbouring countries, such as Zimbabwe.","text - trade":"No major market for arms trafficking is reported within Botswana and firearm ownership is low. The activities of arms brokers, as well as the sale and purchase of weapons, are highly regulated by law. However, the use of arms in cattle stock theft and wildlife poaching remains a concern.","text - environment":"Around 20% of the country is covered in forest, and while illegal logging exists, tree-cover loss has been minimal in recent years. Despite being located on a suspected transit route for illegal timber, the flora crimes market is small. Botswana hosts one of the largest populations of elephant in Africa and therefore attracts a rising numbers of poachers from Angola and Zambia into its northern regions. The country is also a source for donkey hide which is highly sought after in the Chinese market. Despite the reasonably robust management and regulation of wildlife trafficking, concerns have been raised that the poaching of rhinos, cheetahs and other animals has risen steeply. With regard to non-renewable resource crimes, fuel smuggling in Botswana results in as much as 20 million litres of fuel going undeclared every month as criminal groups smuggle it into the country from South Africa or out into Zimbabwe, a practice which is facilitated by weak border controls. The regulation around diamond mining is strong and has successfully stymied the consolidation of a criminal diamond market, but the illegal mining of sand and gravel has become a growing concern, especially during lockdowns.","text - drugs":"Botswana is increasingly playing a role as a transit point for heroin passing through Africa on its way to Europe. With their porous borders, the trans-frontier national parks are considered to be major routes for heroin moving across the continent. Local consumption is small but growing, as heroin cut with cannabis provides an affordable alternative to pure heroin. Botswana is also growing as a transit hub for Andean cocaine moving through the country via third-party criminal actors or arriving directly via air routes. Botswana\u2019s role in the cocaine trade is considered small, but there are concerns that it will become an attractive proposition to traffickers currently using routes, better known to law enforcement agencies, through South Africa and Mozambique. Local cocaine use is small but growing. ##&& Cannabis remains the most widely used drug in Botswana, and most of the cannabis cultivated is consumed in the country. While it is also exported to European countries, the trade appears to be minor. Synthetic drug use is also on the rise, especially synthetic cannabinoids and opioids. While synthetic drugs are not produced in Botswana, the country is a waypoint for mandrax or methaqualone destined for South Africa.","text - criminal actors":"There is no evidence to suggest that domestic mafia-style groups operate in Botswana. However, as a transit country for illicit commodities, foreign actors and organized and coordinated criminal networks operate to manage the production, sale and border crossings of contraband. In the illegal wildlife market, networks are often well-armed and equipped with military knowledge and skill. While the drug and wildlife networks are increasing their operations, no other criminal markets appear to be as well-consolidated. Foreign wildlife poachers operate along the country\u2019s borders, while drug traffickers from South Africa and Eswatini commonly smuggle their drugs through Botswana. Chinese triads operating in the drug and particularly wildlife trafficking markets have reportedly established operations within Botswana. Although it remains one of the least corrupt and most peaceful countries in Africa, issues of nepotism and bribery remain. Aside from corrupt border officials facilitating cross-border smuggling, there is little indication of state-sponsored criminality.","text - leadership and governance":"The government is stable, relatively free of corruption and has a good human rights record overall; however, COVID-19 has heightened political tensions in the country. Civil society has accused the government of human rights abuses during the pandemic, following the introduction of new regulations allowing for press censorship and sweeping powers to make arrests. Furthermore, tensions have risen over poaching, as the government lifted the ban on elephant hunting, sparking outrage among conservationists. Despite Botswana\u2019s relatively low levels of corruption and its good reputation abroad, it is important to note that the country still faces transparency issues, entrenched patronage networks, nepotism and a lack of judicial independence. There is also a concerning lack of legislation around access to information, whistle-blower protection and declaration of assets and liability laws for politicians. ##&& On the international stage, Botswana has ratified most of the international treaties relevant to organized crime and its cooperation with international organizations such as INTERPOL, UNODC and Europol has been good. Importantly, the country also signed the Arms Trade Treaty in 2019. Botswana is party to the Southern African Development Community\u2019s protocol on extradition, and despite not having an extradition treaty with the US, the two countries maintain a good relationship. Botswana has a fairly robust legislative framework to tackle organized crime and the rule of law is strong. It is a signatory to conventions around illicit drug trafficking and has adopted a harsh stance against cannabis, which some believe has led to criminalizing users rather than combating organized crime, and sowing division between the government and civil society. Regulations brought in under the COVID-19 state of emergency have given the president considerable power, which civil society argues has been used to censor criticism. There is a lack of national legislation pertaining to government transparency, and where there are adequate laws around organized crime elsewhere, implementation is often inadequate. Laws against human trafficking have drawn criticism for being insufficiently stringent, and the disarmament of anti-poaching units and legalization of elephant hunting are also widely criticized. ","text - criminal justice and security":"While the rule of law remains strong in Botswana, judicial effectiveness is in decline. Judicial independence is under threat due to a lack of resources and training, resulting in slow processes where judges are often unfamiliar with specific forms of organized crime, in particular human trafficking. Prisons and detention centres meet international standards and overcrowding is being reduced. Botswana does not have any specialized law enforcement units to tackle organized crime, and its point of entry checks are seen as flawed and insubstantial. Despite this, the Botswana Police Service\u2019s (BPS) crime intelligence team has been active and has conducted regular raids targeting drug traffickers. Civilian authorities maintain effective control over law enforcement authorities and the government has mechanisms in place to investigate corruption and mete out punishment. BPS officers receive human rights training and reports of impunity within security forces are rare. However, COVID-19-related changes to the law have received criticism for allowing arbitrary arrests under the vaguely defined charge of spreading false information during the pandemic. ##&& According to reports, electronic scanning devices available at the country\u2019s borders to prevent the transporting of illicit commodities are limited in number and functionality. Furthermore, portions of the border fence are in disrepair and border patrol is under-resourced, meaning that various footpaths and smuggling routes are accessible to criminals. The northern border is of particular concern due to the number of poaching syndicates breaching it to target elephants, while plans are in place to upgrade the border fence between South Africa and Botswana, in the south and southeast.","text - economic and financial environment":"In 2017, Botswana performed very poorly on an evaluation of its anti-money laundering processes and while improvements have been made, they do not meet international standards. As Botswana\u2019s economy is largely cash based, detecting money-laundering activities and banking fraud remains difficult. Vehicle and cigarette smuggling present the biggest risks, and law enforcement continues to focus more on predicate offences, in light of the country\u2019s cash economy and limited resources. ##&& Doing business in Botswana is moderately easy as its regulatory efficiency remains good, but the economy relies heavily on the extraction of minerals by large foreign companies. Despite reaching a middle-income status, many people still face poverty, inequality and unemployment, and the COVID-19 pandemic is thought to have pushed more people into the informal and illicit economy. While corruption is generally low for most businesses, it is pervasive in the public-procurement sector.","text - civil society and social protection":"Botswana offers a fairly robust support system to victims of human trafficking, by coordinating with NGOs to introduce identified trafficking victims to special care facilities that offer shelter as well as medical aid and social services. However, support offered to people who use drugs is fairly limited, with no formal needle and syringe programme or opioid-substitution treatment available. Furthermore, there is no established witness-protection scheme in Botswana, and there have been reports around witness tampering and closed-court hearings. ##&& With support from the UNODC, Botswana created its first specific anti-trafficking legislation, however the government has recently diluted these prevention measures by allowing fines to be given for sex-trafficking crimes, instead of imprisonment. Botswana has long been considered a safe haven for wildlife due to its punitive deterrence policy towards poachers, although, in recent years the government has begun to decriminalise poaching of certain important wildlife species and to disarm anti-poaching units. This, combined with weak border security, has diminished prevention strategies and wildlife smuggling has proliferated. Concerns also exist as to whether the COVID-19 response has shifted focus away from the prevention of organized crime, and towards policing ordinary citizens contravening sometimes arbitrary regulations. ##&& Civil society and NGOs operate freely without harassment and government officials are generally responsive to domestic NGO views, however, the government\u2019s COVID-19 response has damaged this relationship. Civil society remains sustainable but faces increasing challenges in terms of funding and an increasingly hostile legal environment. While freedom of speech and press freedom is generally respected, the state-owned media is biased towards the president. There are several independent newspapers, but accessing information is difficult for journalists and there have been reprisals from the government against those reporting critically of the president. Civil defamation suits also make it difficult for journalists to report on corruption.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Gaborone","GDP (current $US million)":"18340.48","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"2303697","Land Area (sq. km)":"581730","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"57","Freedom in the World Index":"72","Human Development Index":"0.74","Global Peace Index":"1.69","Democracy Index":"7.62","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"60","GDP per capita (current US$)":"7961","1":"3.72","1.1":"3.80","1.2":"3.63","2":"5.63"},{"Corresp":"27","ISO-3":"BFA","Country":"Burkina Faso","ISO-2":"BF","Continent":"Africa","Region":"West Africa","Flag file":"bf.png","1.

Although trafficking affects all demographics, the trafficking of children is the most widespread. Families are often complicit with traffickers,who promise education opportunities, but instead make children pan for gold, or work as washers in artisanal mines,as farmhands, street vendors or domestic servants. Begging tends to be organized, with some children forced into it when attending Quranic schools. Many children are also trafficked to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Mali, Niger and Togo for forced labour or sexual exploitation. Additionally, women from neighbouring countries are often lured to Burkina Faso with fake job offers, and then subjected to prostitution, or forced labour in bars. Mineworkers from neighbouring countries, particularly Niger, are also exploited and increasingly controlled by jihadist groups. ##&& Due to unemployment, drought and toughsocio-economic conditions, many people, especially the youth, leave Burkina Faso in search of better opportunities. While the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) allows free movement within the region, citizens have also started using northbound smuggling routes towards Libya, as well as the Mediterranean route to Europe.","text - trade":"With crises continuing in neighbouring C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Mali, Burkina Faso has become a significant transit hub for weapons trafficking. Weapons are often stolen from security services, and small arms and light weapons have been used by criminal networks to attack law enforcement and civilians. These arms are also used during inter-ethnic and inter-community tensions, most notably in the Liptako Gourma region, which extends through Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. The conflicts within the three countries have contributed to illicit arms flows, and groups affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State have become increasingly active in the arms trafficking market.","text - environment":"Criminal actors are involved in both flora and fauna trafficking in Burkina Faso. Armed groups, primarily affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, have taken over territory and increased resource extraction in previously protected areas, sometimes offering livelihoods to local people. Armed groups seeking to earn profits through the sale of wood, charcoal and other materials contribute to increasing rates of environmental degradation. While most of the annual loss of wooded areas is linked to farming, some species have been destroyed by criminal gangs trafficking timber. With regard to fauna, pangolins and desert tortoises are illegally hunted and sold to criminal gangs meeting demand from South-eastern Asia. In 2017, a record seizure in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire of three tonnes of pangolin scales was reported, representing approximately four thousand pangolins, a portion of which were captured in Burkina Faso. Illegal primate hunting is also known to be a problem in Burkina Faso, as they are used in traditional medicine markets. ##&& Burkina Faso is a major gold producer, heavily linked to livelihoods, criminality and corruption. Analysis of atmospheric mercury emissions show significantly more gold is mined annually than reported. Gold is smuggled to neighbouring countries as well as to countries abroad, including those in the Arab Gulf. Rising insecurity in areas near mines involves mineworkers, criminal networks, entrepreneurs, the state and foreign actors. Goldmining and smuggling are key revenue streams for violent extremist groups in Burkina Faso, and it is likely that proceeds go to groups in Mali and Niger as well. Groups aligned with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State control gold-mining sites and have allowed artisanal gold mining in areas previously off limits. Formal artisanal and small-scale gold-mining operators have been banned in some areas where the groups are most active and where the government has been driven out.","text - drugs":"The capital, Ouagadougou is a significant illicit drug trafficking hub, which includes heroin,destined for European and North American markets. A luxury drug, often linked to tourism and the upper class, heroin is smuggled by air along the Mumbai, Addis Ababa, Bamako or Ouagadougou axis and by road along the Bittou, Lom\u00e9, Cotonou, and Lagos axis. As with heroin, most synthetic drugs are also considered luxury drugs, although the market is limited. Notably, Tramadol trafficking and consumption is growing rapidly, and it is distinctly non-luxury, feeding a larger market. Moreover, annual seizures of amphetamines are high. Burkina Faso is also increasingly a source country for cannabis, trafficked to Benin, Ghana and Mali, and grown along the border with Ghana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Togo. However, it is not unusual to find the drug in Ouagadougou, in the north-western periphery, in Bobo Dioulasso in the Kou Valley, and the region of Boromo. While relatively limited, cannabis is mainly consumed by unemployed youth and the expat community. Although cocaine trafficking is limited, the country is at risk of becoming a transit country for the drug through Sahelian routes and nearby countries.","text - criminal actors":"In Burkina Faso, terrorist groups affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State are active and operate mainly in the northern and eastern areas of the country, with several attacks occurring in Ouagadougou. Many groups have a known name and control territory, and though they receive support from regional and international jihadist groups, they are also involved in organized crime and exploit local criminal networks. Such activities include the smuggling of counterfeit cigarettes and pharmaceutical drugs as well as illicit gold mining, in areas where the government has been pushed out. Criminal networks are built around actors with transactional, overlapping criminal relationships. The influence, scale and scope of local criminal networks has spread to include illegal gold mining, narcotics trafficking, smuggling, contraband sales, endangered fauna trafficking and money laundering. Most are low-level transporters linked to criminal networks based in neighbouring countries. ##&& Many state actors are involved in corruption and embezzlement in Burkina Faso, and while state-embedded actor cooperation with jihadist groups has declined over past decades, security forces and government elites are now believed to facilitate drug and contraband trafficking, including fuel and cigarettes. Furthermore, as a transit country for illicitly traded commodities, many foreign actors are involved in the criminal networks in Burkina Faso. While the key actors are local, most of the drugs networks are connected to individuals from Latin America. Many other gangs, including jihadist groups, operate in the greater Sahel-Saharan region.","text - leadership and governance":"Historically, there has been little political will to address organized crime in Burkina Faso. Since 2015, the government has taken steps to address the systemic corruption which has undermined previous efforts. However, existing state structures struggle to provide basic services and remain functionally deficient in many areas. While the government has made efforts to investigate and punish economic and political crimes, as demonstrated by passing anti-corruption legislation, shortcomings remain. Corruption is perceived to be fairly high and access to information is also relatively poor. Entrenched elites have precluded meaningful reforms since the transition from the Compaor\u00e9 regime (1987\u20132014), but there are initiatives to increase government transparency, accountability and cooperation with civil society, largely due to pressure from civil society and the general public. ##&& Burkina Faso has ratified all international treaties relevant to organized crime, and the country closely cooperates with international organizations including the UN, INTERPOL, the EU, ECOWAS and foreign governments, to effectively counter organized crime and terrorism. Burkina Faso also has a more robust rule of law compared to many other African nations. Although these domestic laws address organized crime and specific criminal markets, the country lacks capacity for effective enforcement, and extrajudicial killings by law enforcement have been recorded.","text - criminal justice and security":"Burkina Faso has lost significant territorial control to violent extremist groups. Bordering six countries, many of which face insecurity and insurgency issues, Burkina Faso\u2019s border control efforts enduremany challenges. This necessitates outside assistance, provided by the international community. The threat of Islamic extremism has prompted international and national investments into strengthening law enforcement and investigative capacity, however, this is predominantly focused on counterterrorism rather than targeting organized crime. While terrorist groups occasionally attack drug trafficking convoys, and routinely pillage villages and steal livestock, such activities cannot be characterized as organized crime and are seldom prioritized for investigation. ##&& With the growing threat of terrorism spilling over from Sahel-based Islamic extremist movements, judicial authorities and instruments are being developed to respond to the threat. Additionally, the judicial system benefits from technical support and capacity building. Efforts are still needed to strengthen units and aid the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of organized crime and terrorism cases.Asignificant portion of the prison population consists of pre-trial detainees, which suggests a case backlog and judicial inefficiency in processing cases.Several attacks on civilians, including extrajudicial killings, have been carried out by members of the security services who operate with impunity, and zero accountability. There are documented cases of the Burkinabe state supporting 'self-defence' groups or ethnic militias carrying out massacres on its behalf. The country has one law enforcement unit tasked withcountering organized crime, however there are no judiciary-related specialized units to support it. ","text - economic and financial environment":"Although basic anti-money-laundering laws and structures exist, effective enforcement remains a challenge due to the weak capacity of the financial intelligence unit and because ofthe country'slarge informal economy. This is due in part to state actor complicity, but also the informal and cash nature of the economy. Progress has been made, but money laundered by the former regime is still in use and the government has failed to respond to requests for asset recovery. Poverty remains high, while many shortcomings in respect to health, education and gender equality still exist. Furthermore, programme implementation is typically left to local institutions due to decentralization and a culture of self-help, but financial support often depends on foreign donors. Notably,a portion of the economy is no longer in the state\u2019s control because of the jihadist insurgency. However, a recent government plan focusing on structural transformation of the economy and welfare may reduce incentives to engage in criminal activities. Despite this, doing business remains difficult in Burkina Faso because of the levels ofpoverty as well as complicated regulations.","text - civil society and social protection":"While Burkina Faso does not have a witness protection programme, significant measures have been implemented to address human trafficking. The government has attempted to improve procedures to identify victims and opened a 24-hour shelter in Ouagadougou, where food, clothing, health care and legal assistance is provided with the support of international and non-governmental organizations. Still, long-standing care for victims remains insufficient.With service providers needing fundsand resources to offer protection and treatment,the government acknowledges that victim services are lacking, which often results in the re-trafficking of victims. Although no formal state-based strategy to promote victim participation in trials exists, and support mechanisms for victims of modern slavery need enhancing, the country is better off in this respect than other African nations. ##&& Some initiatives are ongoing to prevent organized crime, including the training of law enforcement and better management of porous borders, however, there are no community-driven prevention activities. Burkina Faso has considerable civil society traditions and numerous organizations, including village groups and other community-based associations. A wide range of non-state actor groups including professional unions, human-rights groups and associations promoting literacy, environmental issues and advocacy for vulnerable groups, arecritical to the country's civil society.

Timber trafficking occurs in the eastern DRC and across the region, however once it leaves the DRC, the trade is well regulated, and no evidence points to it being a consolidated criminal market in Burundi. Although Burundi lacks the wildlife diversity found elsewhere in the region, it was historically an ivory hub in Central Africa and has an ivory stockpile. Additionally, poaching has continued unabated and is believed to be a significant issue affecting the populations of elephants, pangolins, mountain gorillas and African Grey parrots. Burundi is also a transit country for wildlife trafficking, largely facilitated by corrupt officials, as is the case with gold smuggling. Illicit gold is mined locally, with a large proportion smuggled to the United Arab Emirates, as well as being imported from the DRC. In addition to gold, the prevalence of valuable minerals, such as copper, cobalt and platinum; along with Burundi\u2019s dire economic situation, are incentives for mineral smuggling. After gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum are the most profitable and most commonly smuggled minerals throughout the country, and the wider region.","text - drugs":"Burundi is a minor waypoint for drugs, including cocaine and heroin, largely due to inadequate border controls. Heroin is imported via the eastern border en-route to Europe by air, or elsewhere in Africa, via land routes. Domestic heroin consumption is rising, and it is often consumed in combination with anti-inflammatories and paracetamol in a local mix known as \u2018boost\u2019. As it is relatively expensive, cocaine consumption is low; however, crack cocaine use is growing given its lower cost and preferred effect. Burundi is an emerging cocaine transit country, connecting South American cocaine imports from the DRC and Kenya to European markets via land routes to Entebbe International Airport in Uganda. Most shipments are concealed as luggage or cargo, or as internal body concealments by \u2018mules\u2019. While synthetic drug consumption is low, Burundi is a source country for cannabis, which is often trafficked to neighbouring Rwanda. It is also a transit country for cannabis produced by its neighbours, and a destination country for cannabis trafficked from the DRC.","text - criminal actors":"Criminal groups involved in activities such as arms and human trafficking include both non-state armed militias and government-affiliated militias. The former are the most prevalent, while smaller criminal syndicates appear heavily involved in organized criminal activity. Notably, smugglers cooperate extensively with corrupt state officials, primarily border control officials, who facilitate illicit goods smuggling between Burundi and the DRC. The Imbonerakure, the youth league of the country\u2019s ruling party, the CNDD-FDD, constitutes the country\u2019s main criminal network, and is involved in extortion, kidnapping, illegal taxation, smuggling and murder. In some areas, it has more authority than the Burundian police or local administrators, although many members have been arrested. Moreover, organized forms of violence are often perpetrated by members of the state security apparatus as well, consolidating repressive government rule by intimidation and enabling corruption. Petty corruption among police officers is commonplace, and the complacency of high-ranking officials has rendered Burundi a logistical hub for arms trafficking, gold smuggling and human trafficking operations. In particular, state officials across various departments, including the police, as well as teachers, and the families of human-trafficking victims, are known to be complicit in human trafficking. Leading officials in the ruling party are especially corrupt and involved in both organized crime and illicit economic activities at the national level. The CNDD-FDD has established ties to foreign criminal actors that engage in both smuggling and money laundering. ##&& Rwandan officials have also allegedly been involved in the recruitment of Burundian refugees into militias supporting the Burundian opposition, and human smugglers in Burundi often originate from Rwanda or the DRC. Chinese nationals are also involved in ivory trafficking out of Burundi, while foreign businesspeople from Lebanon and elsewhere in Africa participate in trafficking networks under the protection of corrupt officials. No evidence points toward the existence of mafia-style groups in Burundi, although some militias are known to feature organized hierarchies and it is likely that they are involved in illicit trade.","text - leadership and governance":"Persistent political unrest and ethnic tension undermines governance, and as such, the government has made minimal effort to combat organized crime. Although the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) Secretariat is headquartered in Bujumbura, the government has demonstrated near indifference in addressing illicit mineral mining and smuggling, which contribute to the wealth of key officials. Several high-profile scandals involving the presidency have come to light, one resulting in the murder of a prominent activist in 2009, and armed rebellions have failed to destabilize the government. As a one-party state, accountability is nearly non-existent, with ruling-party securocrats, the police and local administrators engaging in malfeasance. Burundi is one of the most corrupt regimes in the world, with rampant crime and nepotism. Its zero-tolerance policy lacks credibility, as only low-level police have been arrested. Moreover, authorities are known to allocate public funds to the Sangwe Cooperatives, composed of ruling-party members. Some government ministries have ceased publication of economic data and annual reports, and the government has been accused of failing to respect legal obligations, evidenced by the post-electoral crackdown in 2020. Many leaders also failed to declare their assets, while government subsidies and public sector salaries are used to ensure regime loyalty. ##&& Although Burundi is party to international organized crime agreements and is a member of the Great Lakes Judicial Cooperation Network, the country\u2019s regional cooperation efforts fail to prevent or combat organized crime. Authorities have previously arrested UN personnel, banning them from investigating sensitive matters, and as such, the US and European security services severed ties with their Burundian counterparts. Moreover, Burundi withdrew from the International Criminal Court, and threatened to withdraw from the UN Refugee Agency. In 2020, the government expelled the country\u2019s World Health Organization (WHO) representative, as then president Pierre Nkurunziza was in denial about the COVID-19 pandemic. Since Nkurunziza\u2019s death in June 2020, the government has re-established ties and appointed a new WHO representative. Notably, Burundian legislation addresses wildlife, arms, drug and human trafficking. The latter was updated to include formal penalties, but although this resulted in a decline in human trafficking, the issue persists. Furthermore, wildlife-related legislation is generally not enforced, and arms traffickers operate with a large degree of impunity.","text - criminal justice and security":"Although Burundi\u2019s judge appointment process enables judicial independence, judges are subjected to intense political pressure and are known to be subordinate to the state, evidenced in the conviction of activists for their criticism of the government. The Supreme Court lacks a records management programme, triggering inefficient liaising with lower courts and prompting lower courts to make decisions based on outdated precedents. Moreover, prisons are poorly managed, understaffed and overcrowded, and over half of the prisoners are pre-trial detainees. Due to the involvement of high-ranking officials in organized crime and illicit business, law enforcement supervisory and investigative capacity is limited and undermined, despite anti-corruption and anti-organized crime legislation. Members of the Public Security Police in particular are often involved in facilitating crimes, and the rebel and military backgrounds of most police have become apparent in their inappropriate handling of suspects, and the general public. Since 2015, the government has focused on consolidating its control over the country rather than on combating organized crime, which is exacerbated by insufficient infrastructure. ##&& Burundi\u2019s territorial integrity is extremely fragile, largely due to border porosity, especially along its border with the DRC. Border officials lack proper training, and as such, cross-border smuggling and trafficking activities occur unabated, with most illicit commodities entering via Tanzania. Since the outbreak of conflict, army and militiamen from the Imbonerakure have been deployed to border regions. However, armed rebels based in the DRC have successfully organized attacks in Burundi. Despite strict surveillance, border infiltration from Rwanda also occurs, especially around Kibira National Park and the Ruzizi Plain.","text - economic and financial environment":"The largely informal nature of the Burundian economy raises significant money laundering concerns. Despite having legislation in place and the country being party to relevant conventions, inadequate resources hinder implementation and efficacy. Moreover, the government lacks political will to combat money laundering, and has failed to provide adequate funding or implement training. The ruling party controls the Central Bank and the small national banking sector, devising methods to launder stolen assets with impunity. Although banks are legally obligated to report large deposits or suspicious transactions, this does not occur, and the Ministry of Finance\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit has yet to become operational. Regulations on the electronic transfer of funds are also lacking. ##&& Leading government officials own hotels in the capital, where a hotel construction boom occurred as a result of money laundering activities. Unemployment rates are high, and most people live in rural areas, without economic prospects, thus triggering rising rates of human smuggling and trafficking. Illicit mining also presents a significant economic challenge; individual mineworker registration is nearly non-existent, and the sector contributes little to the economy, reflecting inefficient regulation. Officials also infringe on property rights, and land conflict management is often driven by political motives, with the properties of prominent opponents in exile illegally seized. The rise of the informal economy is also a hindrance to the state's limited economic regulatory capacity and doing business in Burundi is extremely difficult.","text - civil society and social protection":"The limited support that is available to victims of organized crime in Burundi is provided by NGOs. Drug rehabilitation centres are insufficiently stocked and understaffed. Burundi also lacks prisoner reintegration programmes, and support for victims of human trafficking and modern slavery, and has failed to update human trafficking statistics. Although increased screening for human trafficking indicators has been introduced at the Melchior Ndadaye International Airport in Bujumbura, the implementation of prevention mechanisms remains limited. ##&& Government repression has severely restricted civil society capacity, and since the outbreak of conflict, only civil society organizations that serve as government allies are allowed to operate successfully. NGOs have been banned, and repressive state policies target independent media and anti-corruption activists. As such, the Anti-corruption and Economic Malpractice Observatory is the only anti-corruption organization in operation. Media freedom has significantly deteriorated, with many journalists forced into exile, detained on false charges, or intimidated when reporting on the misuse of public funds. Human-rights activists have also been arrested and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. In 2018, online accounts were temporarily suspended for readers of the independent website Iwacu, as well as the BBC. Furthermore, during the 2020 election, authorities arrested opposition militants and staged a digital blackout, blocking social media platforms.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Bujumbura","GDP (current $US million)":"3012.33","Income group":"Low income","Population":"11530580","Land Area (sq. km)":"27830","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"97.1","Freedom in the World Index":"14","Human Development Index":"0.43","Global Peace Index":"2.51","Democracy Index":"2.14","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"19","GDP per capita (current US$)":"261","1":"4.52","1.1":"4.40","1.2":"4.63","2":"2.08"},{"Corresp":"29","ISO-3":"CPV","Country":"Cabo Verde","ISO-2":"CV","Continent":"Africa","Region":"West Africa","Flag file":"cv.png","1.

Forced labour of children is also often characterised by long hours and physical and sexual abuse. Some Cabo Verdean children, particularly those in disadvantaged or isolated areas and engaged in begging and labour-intensive work, are especially vulnerable to being trafficked. ##&& While human smuggling is limited, the archipelago has been used as a transit country for people from mainland Africa who are smuggled to the Canary Islands.

The few cases of environmental damage registered by the Cabo Verde environmental guard, mostly in the form of illegal deforestation, were carried out by private companies developing residential subdivisions and were not linked to criminal groups. Wildlife trafficking, however, is underreported. Local consumption of turtle meat,driven by strenuous financial conditions, appears to be growing and is evidenced by increased street sales. The most prevalent fauna crime, however, is illegal fishing, with large industrial fishing fleets, from countries including Spain, China and Japan, carrying out fishing activities for different species such as tuna and sharks in Cabo Verdean waters.","text - drugs":"The country's sizeable maritime zone and remote areas make it appealing to traffickers transporting commodities via air and sea routes, and a growth in tourism and business has expanded opportunities for drug trafficking via human couriers. The development of international tourism is also contributing to the growth of a domestic drug market.Cabo Verde has seen growth in heroin and cocaine seizures and is viewed as an easy maritime trans-shipment point for illicit drugs destined for European markets by sea, or via North African departure points. South American cocaine is also smuggled via Cabo Verde directly to European destinations, particularly Spain, or via other North or West African states to Europe, the Middle East or Asia.Trafficking networks attempt to disguise their point of origin by using Cabo Verde as a transit point.Both heroin and cocaine are consumed on the islands to an unknown extent. ##&& Cannabis is the most consumed substance in the archipelago, and the municipal area of Santa Catarina de Santiago is becoming a major centre of production, consumption, and trafficking. The product is produced domestically on farms on the outskirts of Assomada. Cabo Verde is a significant transit country for illicit drugs, like cannabis, trafficked from domestic African production points to markets in Europe. The islands are used by Moroccan traffickers, with their products destined for both Europe and the Americas. Additionally, methamphetamines are one of the most frequently used narcotics, and there are reports of synthetic drugs, including Ecstasy from South America, on the Sal and Boa Vista islands.","text - criminal actors":"Cabo Verde's importance as a transit corridorin the West African cocaine trade and the existence of sizeable Cabo Verdean communities in the United States, the Netherlands, Portugal, France and Switzerland has contributed to the formation of criminal gangs on the islands. Cabo Verdean organized crime is primarily perpetrated by street gangs, which increasingly fight to control trafficking routes and have varying levels of organization and tactics. Such groups with family or community ties on the islands have connections to island-based drug smugglers. Cabo Verdean gangs are one of the most important sources of drugs in Portugal, and Cabo Verdean criminals deported from the Americas or Europe sometimes get involved in drug smuggling as intermediaries between the South American drug cartels and Cabo Verdean criminals overseas. ##&& Members of these criminal gangs include people from Spain, Cuba, Switzerland, Portugal and Brazil, while Irish gangs are also involved in the cocaine trade. Additionally, there are reports of Nigerian mafia-style groups and Chinese criminal actors present in the country. Regarding state embedded criminal actors, several scandals have showcased the criminal interests of some high-ranking officials, and law enforcement officials may also be involved in drug trafficking.","text - leadership and governance":"The government, with international support, has taken steps to tackle drug trafficking by strengthening its capacity for interdiction and investigation. Drug use is not pervasive enough to cause serious socio-economic problems, and Cabo Verde can be characterized as politically stable, with established democratic institutions and adequate protection of human rights and civic freedoms. Corruption is relatively low, and transparency is considered high, although Cabo Verde lacks an independent anti-corruption body. Several policy measures have been implemented, such as the strengthening of the role of the Court of Auditors and the reinforcement of the Public Acquisition Regulatory Authority. ##&& In order to combat drug trafficking and illegal fishing, and to build the monitoring capacity of international waters, Cabo Verde is reliant on international cooperation with partners including Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the US. The Spanish Marine Corps provides training to the Special Operations Unit of the Cabo Verdean National Guard, and Brazil's Naval Mission helped modernize the national Coast Guard. Cabo Verde is party to international agreements related to organized crime, human trafficking and mutual legal assistance. Additionally, Cabo Verde has extradited criminals wanted in the US despite the absence of an extradition agreement. Cabo Verde also has a legal framework and national strategies in place to combat organized crime, including drug trafficking, financial crimes, human trafficking, and illegal fishing. The legal framework regulates the mechanisms for combating and producing illicit substances, while the Drug Control Coordination Commission is responsible for coordinating drug demand and supply interventions, under the Ministry of Justice and Internal Administration. The UNODC programme in Cabo Verde has also supported local authorities in strengthening the national legal framework.","text - criminal justice and security":"While Cabo Verde has an independent judiciary, and the criminal justice system has improved it\u2019s ability to prevent, investigate, and prosecute serious organized crime cases, forensic investigation capacity is lacking. Moreover, access to justice services, particularly for vulnerable people,remains a challenge. The trend of increasing violent crime has led to a rise in the prison population. Incarceration rates are relatively high in relation to population size, with prisons suffering from overcrowding and high recidivism rates. In partnership with the US, the national police are improving the management of prisons, adopting community policing strategies, and strengthening the Financial Intelligence Unit's and the Judicial Police's capacity to address transnational organized crime. The Judicial Police havealso reinforced their technical capacity through specialized equipment and maintenance services provided by the EU. The government has provided some financial support to build the capacity and technical training of law enforcement and justice officials, particularly on the issue anti-trafficking, but overall, insufficient staffing and a lack of resources impede the state'sability to identify victims, collect evidence and carry out effective investigations. The strong social cohesion among local communities results in individuals often failing to report crimes or testify, and most islands do not have a police presence. ##&& Cabo Verde's geography and lack of resources make its extensive territorial waters and borders difficult to patrol. Trafficking, of cocaine in particular, has been facilitated by the absence of police on some islands. Cabo Verde has established the Centre for Maritime Operations and Safety to coordinate the exchange of information with other countries to combat illicit acts at sea using radar and satellite images.","text - economic and financial environment":"To combat financial crime, an EU-supported Financial Intelligence Unit and a national office for asset recovery has been established, and the country is a member of the Egmont Group.

Cabo Verde is a member of the Economic Community of West African States, which aims to facilitate the adoption and implementation of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism in West Africa, and it is one of the only countries in Africa that seizes assets. However, Cabo Verde has played a role in recent financial scandals, demonstrating a weak regulatory banking environment and poorly implemented financial regulations. As a result, the government approved the closure of local offshore banks serving only non-resident customers. Nonetheless, it is likely thatthe most of the risks of money laundering are linked to drug trafficking operations. ##&& A significant portion of the economy is rooted in the informal sector, contributing to a lack of transparency and money laundering risks.

Currently, the state does not provide awitness protection programme, rather,support is provided by officially recognized local NGOs. The Institute for Children and Adolescents (ICCA) runs shelters on two islands, and staff on all nine inhabited islands provide services for minors that have undergone trauma, including from trafficking. Additionally, the Cabo Verdean Institute for Gender Equality has a shelter for domestic violence victims that trafficking victims can access. ##&& In response to an increase in crime, the government strengthened the operational resources of the National and Judicial police, security apparatus, and prison services and launched a programme focused on prevention and educational measures to reduce crime and violence. The Ministry of Internal Affairs also announced an increase in urban patrolling, improvement of public lighting and interventions in troubled neighbourhoods. In order to address the rise of sex tourism, the Minister of Justice and Labour and the police collaborate with tourism operators in Europe to prevent its facilitation.While the ICCA has been training civil society leaders, judges, and police on victim identification procedures and referrals, many authorities remain unable to distinguish trafficking from abuse and negligence. In partnership with the Community Anti-drug Coalition,in the Ponta D\u2019\u00c1gua neighbourhood, the Coordination Commission for Alcohol and Other Drugs, has provided training for youth to promote healthy attitudes and behaviour.

Conflicts in the far north (Boko Haram insurgency) and south-west\/north-west (secessionists) contribute to the prevalence of human trafficking by creating large numbers of displaced people, diminishing the presence of security forces, damaging livelihoods and disrupting education. There is also a rural\u2013urban dimension to human trafficking, where young people are lured to cities with the promise of employment before being subjected to forced labour or sex trafficking. Evidence exists of trafficking, child-labour exploitation, and sexual exploitation in the country's artisanal mining sites and gravel quarries, as well as fishing and agriculture operations. Victims are also exploited abroad, with fraudulent labour brokers facilitating trafficking to the Middle East, Europe, the US, and other parts of Africa. The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on labour and mobility and has reinforced modern slavery and human trafficking practices in Cameroon. ##&& The lines between human trafficking and human smuggling are often blurred in the context of Cameroon.

There is also a growing new phenomenon involving the smuggling of young boys and girls identified as young football talents in urban areas. Overall, many young people in the country are willing to pay exorbitant fees to go abroad, using migration \u2018brokers\u2019 who secure fraudulent documents and visas for travelling overseas.

Arms trafficking has, however, been a fixture in Cameroon for many years. Before 2016, the manufacturing of artisanal weapons was not prohibited by law, and these weapons were accessible to criminal actors, mostly urban youths in large cities. The armed conflict with secessionists in the southwest and northwest regions since 2017 has only increased demand for illicit arms. Since 2012, Boko Haram has also been active in Cameroon and involved in the trafficking of arms.","text - environment":"In Cameroon, flora smuggling is a major concern in the forestry sector, with heavy involvement from government officials and traditional authorities. In particular, there is widespread illegal timber logging and smuggling to Europe and Asia. Additionally, most timber consumed locally comes from informal sources. Illegal activities reported in the forestry sector include illegal allocation of concessions, illegal logging, laundering of illegally harvested wood, and corruption in the allocation of logging permits. ##&& In regard to fauna crimes, Cameroon is considered a source and transit country for the trafficking of wildlife, including elephant tusks and rhino horn, as well as pangolins, snakes, lizards and monkeys. Illegal trade in bushmeat also remains a concern. The country has already lost several species, including black rhinos and cheetahs, due to poaching, loss of habitat, and human\u2013wildlife conflict. Theft and trafficking of cattle and other livestock are also common in various parts of the country, as well as a plethora of fisheries-related crimes. The country is a key transit point for wildlife trafficking originating in Central African countries, with the town of Djoum in the southern Dja region serving as crucial transit hub for ivory coming from the country\u2019s southern and eastern neighbours. ##&& As for non-renewable resource crimes, Cameroon is a destination and transit country for illicit fuel from Nigeria. Local consumption of stolen fuel is facilitated by corruption. Moreover, mining sector operations are opaque and include unauthorized, unlicensed mining, and deserted pits posing safety hazards. There is also evidence of gemstone trafficking, including diamonds from the CAR.","text - drugs":"Cameroon is considered a major importer and transshipment point for cannabis produced domestically and in other African countries. Even though it is illegal, cannabis is the most commonly used drug in the country. Cannabis is mostly produced in the southwest and northwest and then trafficked primarily to Nigeria. Tramadol is the main synthetic drug of concern in Cameroon, and the most in-demand drug in the country after cannabis. It is generally trafficked from India via West Africa, and Nigeria in particular, and distributed within Cameroon and other Central African countries. High unemployment rates and widespread poverty are among the drivers of the rising number of people selling synthetic drugs on street corners across the country. ##&& Cameroon is a transit and destination country for heroin. While previously only a transit site for heroin, consumption has increased among elites. There are alleged links between domestic-based terrorists and other violent non-state actors and the illicit trafficking of drugs, including heroin. The cocaine market is the least pervasive drug market in Cameroon. The drug is mostly just moved through Cameroon, but an increasing number of local elites are believed to be consuming the drug.","text - criminal actors":"Mafia-style groups in Cameroon are predominantly either terrorist groups that engage in organized criminal activity, or armed secessionist groups. Boko Haram finances its operations primarily through criminal activities such as kidnapping-for-ransom, extortion and burglary. In the southwest and northwest parts of Cameroon, members of secessionist groups have also transformed into criminal networks and mafia-style groups involved in arms trafficking, kidnapping, and racketeering of business owners for financial gain. There are also criminal networks operating as kidnapper groups in the Adamawa region, as well as armed robbers and traffickers in the eastern region, and criminal networks exploiting the conflict in the southwest and northwest regions of the country. They are involved in a variety of criminal activities. ##&& High levels of corruption exist in state institutions, which potentially provide a safe haven for criminal actors. Corruption by state officials involves embezzlement of public funds and abuse of office, and foreign actors are known to operate across the country. Criminal groups from neighbouring countries have been accused of kidnapping herders for ransom as well as cattle theft within the country. Boko Haram is also known to have foreign members who facilitate transnational organized criminal activity, such as arms trafficking and trafficking of opioids. Additionally, research suggests that criminal groups with Asian ties are involved in the illegal exploitation of timber and mining resources. Similarly, fisheries-related crimes involve local and foreign industrial-fisheries stakeholders.","text - leadership and governance":"Trust and faith in the current regime have significantly diminished due to its inability to respond effectively to the various security threats facing the country.

Moreover, the government is marred by high levels of corruption, and has been reported as a facilitator in many of types of crime. ##&& At an international level, Cameroon has ratified many treaties related to preventing and combating organized crime. However, the country has struggled with implementation. It has also participated in bilateral and regional initiatives to address human trafficking, human smuggling, drug trafficking and arms trafficking. At the domestic level, Cameroon has a number of laws pertaining to organized crime in its legislative framework. However, full implementation of these laws is lacking. There are also gaps in domestic legislation that benefit traffickers.","text - criminal justice and security":"In Cameroon, the judiciary is poorly equipped and there is a huge backlog of cases awaiting prosecution. Also, there are no judicial units with the specific aim of countering organized crime. In the past, the state has encouraged some victims of human trafficking and smuggling to settle cases out of court due to weak cooperation between state and NGOs. Additionally, the judiciary in Cameroon is not independent and is controlled by the executive branch of the government. There is also perceived impunity for government officials accused or suspected of involvement in organized crime, notably economic crime, despite some arrests of high-profile officials. Moreover, prison conditions fall far below international standards. Law enforcement agencies have received some training and regularly make critical interceptions, including seizures of illicit goods. However, there is no general law enforcement unit specializing in organized crime in the country. There are several reports of chronic corruption in law-enforcement agencies, particularly in customs services and the forestry sector. This has weakened national efforts to effectively deal with organized crime. In regard to territorial integrity, Cameroon\u2019s borders are notoriously porous. This is worsened by armed conflict and unrest, as well as corruption among border police and customs officers.","text - economic and financial environment":"The Cameroonian economy is highly regulated and influenced by governmental price controls.

Cameroon also has laws and institutions governing its anti-money laundering responses, and although it is part of a regional task force tackling the issue, significant gaps remain. Cameroonian banks are also alleged to have collaborated with criminal networks, facilitating their illicit activity.","text - civil society and social protection":"With respect to human trafficking, the treatment of victims and victim support remains weak and varies significantly from case to case. The government does not have policies in place to encourage victims to participate in investigations, or the prosecution of traffickers; to provide counselling, legal support, or any other assistance to victims testifying in court; or to protect victims cooperating with investigations despite reports of trafficking networks threatening victims during trials. The government has also not made any meaningful efforts to systematically prevent organized crime. Meanwhile, civil society is active in combating organized crime in some areas, such as human trafficking and human smuggling, where it plays a crucial role with respect to direct services to victims. Similarly, in regard to trafficking of flora, notably timber, and fauna, there is significant and effective cooperation between the state and civil society organizations. Nevertheless, the government is increasingly criticized for cracking down on civil society organizations that oppose or criticize government policies. Legislation on civil society participation is obsolete and does not comply with international standards. Moreover, relations between the state and privately-owned media are contentious. The Biya regime has continued its repression of journalists and the media environment more broadly, with journalists reporting an ever-increasing number of threats and attacks. Arbitrary detention of journalists is not uncommon, and the worsening situation for press freedom was highlighted by the death of journalist Samuel Wazizi while in detention, arrested in 2019 following his criticism of the government.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Yaounde","GDP (current $US million)":"39007.35","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"25876380","Land Area (sq. km)":"475440","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"97.2","Freedom in the World Index":"16","Human Development Index":"0.56","Global Peace Index":"2.65","Democracy Index":"2.77","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"25","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1507","1":"6.32","1.1":"6.25","1.2":"6.38","2":"3.13"},{"Corresp":"33","ISO-3":"CAF","Country":"Central African Republic","ISO-2":"CF","Continent":"Africa","Region":"Central Africa","Flag file":"cf.png","1.

Labour exploitation is widespread and increasing as a result of the large number of displaced persons caused by violent conflict in the country. Both gold and diamond mines, many controlled by armed groups, have been linked to forced labour, particularly relating to minors. Cases of child soldiers have also been documented. Additionally, there have been reports of the enslavement of girls in the northern part of the country, with many trafficked to Sudan and Chad. ##&& Violence and instability in the CAR have pushed many people to seek ways to leave the country via human smuggling. However, most of the movement within the country and across the borders takes place without the facilitation of smugglers. The main challenge for smugglers is navigating complex geographies, insecurity and competing smuggling groups, as opposed to border restrictions.","text - trade":"Despite a UN arms embargo that has been in force since 2013, weapons can easily be brought into the CAR. Armed conflict and border porosity contribute to the illicit demand for small arms and light weapons in the country. Additionally, the 2014 conflict led to the raiding of government armouries, increasing the levels of illicit flows of arms across the country, especially along the Democratic Republic of Congo-CAR border. Some of the weapons trafficking networks supplying armed groups in the CAR are under the control of military officers.","text - environment":"Timber is one of the CAR\u2019s primary exports and logging companies have been linked to armed groups. Armed groups, local communities and some Asian actors illegally exploit timber in the CAR. With no forestry service functioning in most of the country, these actors often operate in cooperation with networks based in Sudan and South Sudan. Timber trafficking for international timber companies mostly occurs at the CAR\u2013Cameroon border, but local communities exploit timber mainly in the southern part of the country. Some companies mix timber cut in the CAR with timber cut in Cameroon. In regard to fauna crimes, the CAR\u2019s legal vacuum allows armed groups and poachers to engage in transnational trafficking of elephant tusks, and animals such as panthers and pangolins. Poachers from Sudan and Chad, along with armed groups that have developed relationships with foreign traffickers, enter the CAR by crossing the border with South Sudan. Additionally, independent militarized poachers take advantage of the lack of governance and enforcement. Among the main trafficked items are ivory and big-cat parts hidden in legal shipments of palm oil or cassava. Systematic bushmeat hunting is also increasing as elephant populations have decreased significantly. Forest elephants have also been targeted for poaching. In regard to non-renewable resource crimes, the illicit production and trafficking of diamonds and gold are prevalent in the CAR. Most of the gold and diamonds produced in the CAR are smuggled abroad. The market also facilitates foreign money laundering operations and has been linked to armed groups.","text - drugs":"As the country lacks transportation infrastructures and is landlocked, the logistical environment is not conducive to heroin trafficking. However, the CAR does have existing links between domestic and regional terrorist organizations and drug trafficking, including heroin trafficking, but little is known of domestic use and supply. Similarly, there is limited evidence of a cocaine-trafficking market in the CAR because cocaine use is limited to the local elite. Meanwhile, cannabis is widely used by the local population, especially among militiamen and youth. While there is no official information on cannabis trafficking, besides some indications of the involvement of armed groups, given the country\u2019s location and the current organized-crime landscape, it would be unrealistic to conclude that there is no illegal activity pertaining to cannabis. In regard to synthetic drugs, tramadol has become a major issue in the country. Tramadol is openly sold in several markets, mainly coming from networks based in eastern Cameroon, Chad and Sudan. Consumption was high in 2018 but the street price has since increased, making it a little less affordable.","text - criminal actors":"Estimates suggest that there are approximately 20 different armed groups operating in the CAR. Among these groups, the main ones are the Union for Peace in the CAR (UPC); the Popular Front for the Renaissance in the CAR and its military wing, the National Defence and Security Committee, and the Rassemblement Patriotique pour le Renouveau de la Centrafrique. As of 2020, UPC is the most powerful armed group. Some of these groups, known as the Anti-balaka, have a very loose command structure and are ethnically based. While 14 armed groups signed a peace deal with the government in 2019, the armed groups still control most of the country. Their main source of funding is extortion and illegal taxation \u2013 in fact, powerful warlords in the country are involved in the illicit taxation of cattle traders. Some of these armed groups specialize in specific criminal markets. Meanwhile, there is also a proliferation of unorganized traffickers, bandits, criminals, robbers, road gangs (zaraguinas), smugglers, thieves and counterfeiters in the country. They focus largely on cattle theft. Since the state security services are not able to counter them, insecurity in the country is high. The CAR can be described as one of the most insecure countries in Africa. ##&& Many state actors in the CAR operate outside the law and cooperate with criminal actors, including law enforcement officials and high-ranking members of the government. Corrupt state actors often become involved criminal enterprises, mainly wildlife crime and diamond trafficking. Moreover, since the peace deal in 2019, the government has included leaders from armed groups, which blurred the lines between state and non-state actors, as well as legal and illegal activities. As for foreign actors, they are numerous and involved in various criminal networks in the CAR, including human trafficking; arms trafficking; the illicit gold, diamond, and timber industries; and fauna crimes. Historically, foreign nationals have also controlled several high-value economic sectors such as the diamond, gold and timber industries, which are associated with criminal activities.","text - leadership and governance":"In the CAR, there is no real state presence outside Bangui. Moreover, a lack of citizen participation and rule of law has created a system of weak governance throughout the country. The CAR ranks among the most fragile states in the world. Furthermore, the country also has an extremely poor record of transparency and accountability. Combating organized crime is not on the government\u2019s agenda and collusion between state and criminal actors is rife. In particular, diamond trafficking has played a key role in CAR politics, including at the highest levels of the government. Additionally, mining deals and state contracts are negotiated in secret, while public tenders are rare. International groups have also identified several suspicious bank accounts used to divert public funds from the CAR. ##&& At international level, the CAR has ratified all but one of the international treaties pertaining to organized crime. The government also relies heavily on the international community and benefits from significant humanitarian aid. However, most international authorities do not trust CAR security services, which are seen as corrupt. As a result, the CAR government has turned to China and Russia. Currently, security cooperation with Russia is well established, while economic cooperation with China is growing. At domestic level, the policy-making capacity of the government is very limited and national policies or laws targeting organized crime are scant. Nevertheless, the CAR has stepped up efforts to combat human trafficking and the penal code criminalizes trafficking for labour and sexual exploitation. International NGOs have also offered support to develop more effective law enforcement in forest and wildlife management, but the outcomes are not yet visible.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judicial system in the CAR has no capacity to combat organized crime. Meanwhile, a large majority of the CAR\u2019s total prison population is in pre-trial detainment. However, a special criminal court was created in 2015 under which some militiamen were sentenced to prison in Bangui in 2019 and 2020, and more cases are pending. There is also national strategy for the demilitarization of prison, which was approved in 2019 and created with the support of several international actors. Similarly, law enforcement agencies in the CAR have no capacity to combat organized crime. Although law enforcement agencies are being rebuilt with the support of several foreign partners, corruption remains a major problem, especially in the customs service. As for territorial integrity, the CAR\u2019s borders represent a unique case of porosity, with the total absence of any border control. The only functioning border posts are located between the CAR and Cameroon.","text - economic and financial environment":"While the CAR has created measures to enhance economic capacity, such efforts have not been sufficient and there is no national implementation capacity. The CAR is among the poorest performers in the world on numerous measures of economic capacity. Additionally, the customs system is unreliable, and businesses often seek tax exemptions via bribes. In the CAR, there is also no capacity to implement anti-money laundering measures. A special investigation unit for money laundering was created several years ago but has no real capacity. In most cases, foreign banks have detected incidents of money laundering in the country.","text - civil society and social protection":"There is little victim and witness support available in the CAR. However, since the conflict broke out, many international NGOs have set up trauma centres and counselling services in conflict areas, including the capital city. Many churches have hosted and protected internally displaced Muslim communities. Similarly, there is no evidence of any policies, strategies or campaigns to help prevent organized crime in the country. As for civil society organizations, they are very weak and focused more on conflict-related issues than organized crimes due to the fact that the conflict is ongoing. There are some international NGOs focused on good governance, anti-corruption and the protection of wildlife. Meanwhile, the media environment is corrupt and dangerous. International journalists were detained or killed while covering the conflict. The government has also often used bribes and intimidation to cover up reporting on corruption scandals.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Bangui","GDP (current $US million)":"2220.31","Income group":"Low income","Population":"4745185","Land Area (sq. km)":"622980","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"107","Freedom in the World Index":"9","Human Development Index":"0.4","Global Peace Index":"3.24","Democracy Index":"1.32","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"26","GDP per capita (current US$)":"468","1":"7.04","1.1":"5.70","1.2":"8.38","2":"1.92"},{"Corresp":"34","ISO-3":"TCD","Country":"Chad","ISO-2":"TD","Continent":"Africa","Region":"Central Africa","Flag file":"td.png","1.

Human trafficking for the purposes of labour exploitation is largely linked to the extractive industries, including gold mining and charcoal production, and also to domestic servitude and artisanal fishing. Sexual exploitation occurs, but to a lesser extent. While human trafficking in Chad is largely internal, an increased number of Chadian sex workers have been noted in neighbouring countries. This suggests that human-trafficking networks operating in Chad are diversifying their geographical focus. The use of deception has also been reported in the recruitment and transportation of young men and boys from Arab communities in southern and eastern Chad to large cities in southern Libya. The recruits are then enlisted as mercenaries in the wars in Libya or Yemen. ##&& Human smuggling in Chad has increased over the past few years, especially with respect to movement from the country\u2019s border with Sudan to Libya. Typically it is Cameroonian and Nigerian migrants already living and working in Chad who travel to Libya through Chad. While the occurrence of smuggling of people from West Africa looking to travel to Europe has remained low, the extent of irregular migration from Chad\u2019s southern regions to Libya and the goldfields in the north has continued to increase. The north-western region of the Tibesti, where the country\u2019s two largest goldfields are located, is one of the country\u2019s main human smuggling hubs. Although many of the migrants are Chadian and would technically be authorized to travel within their country, they often solicit the services of human smugglers because northbound migration for the purposes of gold mining has been criminalized. Overall, restrictions on movement introduced by the government amid the COVID-19 pandemic had little impact on the human smuggling industry in Chad throughout 2020. Darfuri asylum seekers and refugees in eastern Chad also often solicit the services of migrant smugglers. Smugglers tend to come from Saharan ethnic groups and cross-border nomadic groups. Smuggled individuals regularly experience abuse at the hands of their smugglers and death from the perils of the journey.","text - trade":"The challenges presented by arms ownership and smuggling remain acute in Chad. In particular, Chad\u2019s borders are considered porous and are ideal for the illegal exchange of arms. There are several different corridors used for trafficking arms, involving the vast majority of neighbouring countries, including Niger, Sudan and Libya, as well as Nigeria and the Central African Republic. The proliferation of armed groups at most of the country\u2019s borders has amplified the demand for arms. Chad has been affected by the overflow of conflicts from Libya (which began in 2011), the conflict in the neighbouring Darfur region in Sudan since 2003, which leaked across the border into Chad, and the conflict in the Lake Chad region since 2009, with the Boko Haram insurgency. It is worth noting that the government\u2019s request for citizens in eastern Chad to hand in personal weapons may have increased arms smuggling activity by activating the demand for weapons to replace those that were confiscated.","text - environment":"The illicit flora trade is limited compared to other countries in the region, but Chad imports illicit timber from neighbouring Cameroon. In regard to fauna crimes, Chad remains threatened by large-scale poaching activities of large mammals due to high international demand for ivory and other trophies from protected species. Poachers include heavily armed local groups of both domestic and Sudanese or Cameroonian origin. Today, while elephants still present an attractive poachable resource, the presence of rangers has brought about decreased poaching in the area. There is also a widespread practice in northern Chad of capturing falcons and selling them to Middle Eastern buyers. ##&& By far the largest environmental crime market in Chad is non-renewable resource crimes. Illegal gold mining in Chad is widespread and is linked to insecurity and violence. Various individuals are involved, including local miners, organized criminal networks and entrepreneurs, state-embedded actors, and foreign criminal actors, and the livelihoods of large sections of society depend on the industry. Furthermore, the goldfields in northern Chad are major hubs for human smuggling, as well as for human trafficking, as migrants travelling through them are often exploited, either physically or through debt-bondage. Although far less prevalent than gold mining, a limited amount of contraband oil is also present in Chad.","text - drugs":"Chad is a transit country for heroin, to a limited extent, but the overall level of heroin trafficking is considered minimal. Some links exist between domestic and regional terrorist organizations and illicit drug trafficking, including heroin, through the Sahel routes of Northern Africa, with destinations in European and North American markets. Similarly, Chad is a transit country for cocaine. While cocaine trafficking is low, it remains more prevalent than heroin. The cannabis trade is present along most of the southern borders in Chad. Cannabis has been produced along the borders with Nigeria, Cameroon, the Central African Republic and Sudan, and has also been trafficked into Chad from these countries. Cannabis trafficking mostly comes from Nigeria, and there has been some cannabis production in southern Chad, as well as in the Lake Chad region. There has been a slight decline in trafficking due to conflict in the central Sahel. Finally, in terms of synthetic drugs, domestic consumption of Tramadol is a growing problem in Chad. Although more than half of the country\u2019s pharmacies have been shut down in recent years, with some having been involved in the clandestine sale of Tramadol, evidence suggests that the shutdown has had limited success in slowing down the consumption of the drug. Artisanal miners in the informal gold mining sector also use the drug as a way to increase productivity and suppress hunger.","text - criminal actors":"Several armed groups and rebels operate in the north and east of Chad. These groups are involved in various types of trafficking activities, including drug trafficking and gold smuggling. There is a proliferation of unorganized and informal traffickers, bandits, criminals, robbers and road gangs in the country\u2019s far north and east. Corruption is omnipresent in the Chadian administration. Customs and police services have been singled out for protecting traffickers. There are also reports of wildlife officers being involved in the illicit ivory trade. There was also a recent case of state-embedded actors being involved in drug trafficking. As for foreign actors, Chad is at the epicentre of cross-border crime in the region. Incursions of Sudanese groups and nationals from the Central African Republic are common. There are also small autonomous foreign militias in the country, which are known to be involved in wildlife poaching, human trafficking, arms trafficking, mineral trafficking, raiding and kidnapping. It is also possible that armed groups in the far north that are opposed to the N\u2019Djamena regime recruit Sudanese and Libyan mercenaries.","text - leadership and governance":"Although the regulatory and institutional framework to address organized-crime prevalence in Chad has been weak, the government has taken significant steps to tackle criminality, albeit through a solely securitized approach. The military has also been engaged in regular crackdowns on illicit gold mining sites in the north of the country. The goals behind tackling criminal activities were not necessarily to tackle crime in itself, but were more often linked to strategic goals relating to combating armed politico-military opposition or securing access to artisanal gold mining areas to begin government-led industrial extraction. Overall, government transparency in Chad is limited and the country has one of the highest levels of corruption perception in the world. Oversight mechanisms in the country have been quasi non-existent. However, officers from the military and other security agencies have been tried, imprisoned and fined for their involvement in drug-trafficking activities. ##&& On the international level, Chad has given clear indications of promoting international cooperation in combating organized crime. The country has also had extensive relationships with a wide array of international organizations in the fight against transnational organized crime and terrorism in the Sahel, and they have made important efforts to counter Boko Haram in Cameroon and Nigeria. The EU, France and the US have seen Chad as an essential partner in the fight against terrorism and organized crime in the wider region. The country has also ratified several international treaties related to organized crime. On the domestic level, while Chad does have some legal frameworks to counter organized crime, implementation remains a challenge. Moreover, in some areas of the country religious traditions and practices provide legitimacy to certain crime markets, namely human trafficking, with young women often being victims of modern slavery.","text - criminal justice and security":"Vast areas along the border with Sudan are partially or totally beyond the control of the country\u2019s central government. Law enforcement in Chad has been limited to major cities and has remained geographically and functionally limited. Additionally, law enforcement is often in conflict in areas where traditional religious laws are customary. Despite this, special task forces with specific geographical or thematic focuses have been created, and these have experienced some successes in addressing criminality. With regard to the judicial system, there are no specialized judicial units in Chad with the specific aim of countering organized crime. The presence of the state and the judiciary in certain areas of the country where armed rebellions occur is extremely weak.","text - economic and financial environment":"Chad\u2019s economic regulatory capacity remains weak. There has been no significant progress in the correlation between economic regulation and the fight against organized crime, as security remains a major priority for the state. Doing business within Chad is extremely difficult due to its weak economic regulatory capacity. In 2018, Chad\u2019s national assembly passed a law against money laundering and terrorist financing, which provides provisional and repressive measures. The law also covers international cooperation, including mutual legal assistance between competent services of the various states and the extradition of people. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the country\u2019s anti-money laundering framework, more specifically its enforcement, remains extremely weak.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim and witness support in Chad remains limited and focused in key geographic areas. The government has worked with international organizations to support victims of human trafficking. The country has also seen the mobilization of a small group of civil society organizations to denounce trafficking in people. Similarly, prevention measures against organized crime are very weak in Chad, but there has been some mobilization by civil-society actors to carry out such efforts in certain parts of the country. In regard to the media, journalists are often arrested or attacked for negative reporting about the government. Media outlets have been shut down due to criticism in their coverage, and authorities have blocked social media access during protests.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"N'Djamena","GDP (current $US million)":"11314.95","Income group":"Low income","Population":"15946876","Land Area (sq. km)":"1284000","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"105.8","Freedom in the World Index":"17","Human Development Index":"0.4","Global Peace Index":"2.54","Democracy Index":"1.55","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"21","GDP per capita (current US$)":"710","1":"5.87","1.1":"5.35","1.2":"6.38","2":"2.46"},{"Corresp":"38","ISO-3":"COM","Country":"Comoros","ISO-2":"KM","Continent":"Africa","Region":"Southern Africa","Flag file":"km.png","1.

It is also a destination country for forced labour and the exploitation of children. ##&& Human smuggling into Mayotte, which has higher living standards than the Comoros islands, is common and profitable, and has a significant influence on the political economy of both Mayotte and the Comoros. Smuggling businesses are emerging and growing across the islands, especially in Anjouan, as greater numbers of people emigrate irregularly from the Comoros and neighbouring islands. The Comoros is too remote to play a major role in the human-smuggling industry, but the high number of deaths at sea as a result of the smuggling is a grave concern.","text - trade":"The Comoros plays a negligible role in transnational arms trafficking and there are extremely low levels of armed violence on the islands. However, the country is affected by the rampant crimes occurring in the Indian Ocean, including trafficking, piracy and illegal fishing. Cases of piracy and armed robbery are growing, and the use of light weapons, usually acquired from brokers operating in the Indian Ocean, is common among drug traffickers and pirates.","text - environment":"The Comoros is a large producer of vanilla, where an illicit trade runs parallel to the legal trade. There are reports of the country acting as a transit point for illicit Madagascan logs. There has been rapid clearing of land due to population growth and urban development, and while it is not tied to organized crime, it may contribute to unregulated and illicit deforestation. ##&& Illegal fishing is a large problem in the Mozambique Channel and significantly affects the Comoros. While vessels from China and other Asian countries have been identified as the main culprits, there have been vessels sailing under the Comoros flag that have also been implicated. Most of the Comorian fleet has no connection to the country and operates in breach of national laws, mainly in the waters of West Africa. This has led to the EU issuing the Comoros a red card over its complicity in Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Moreover, tortoise trafficking is a major issue and there are also reports of shark fin moving between the Comoros and Madagascar. There are no recent reports of a non-renewable resource crimes market operating in the country. ","text - drugs":"Heroin is imported into the Comoros from Tanzania and Madagascar, primarily through maritime entry points. The Comoros is primarily a destination market for heroin, although there have been some instances of Comorian mules with heroin detained in Mauritius and France. Additionally, poor governance structures and proximity to growing heroin redistribution hubs (particularly Madagascar) could mean that the Comoros\u2019 transit role could grow in the future. Because of the extreme poverty that the majority of the population experiences and the high price of the drug, the cocaine market is very small in the Comoros and for the most part concentrated in the capital, Moroni. Nevertheless, due to its geographical location, the country may become an attractive transit location for cocaine trafficking in the future. ##&& The domestic use of cannabis is widespread, and the drug is both cultivated on the island and imported from Madagascar and Tanzania. Some cannabis resin imported into the Comoros is exported onwards to Mayotte. Synthetic-drug use is a growing concern in the Comoros, especially among the youth, with the country operating predominantly as a destination market with little onward transit. Synthetic drugs are cheap and widely accessible. The use of synthetic cannabinoids is growing and has been blamed for an increase in local theft and domestic and social problems.","text - criminal actors":"The Comorian state facilitates or is actively involved in most illicit markets on the islands, with corruption being particularly focused on human trafficking. Human smuggling to Mayotte is fully state-sanctioned, as the state does not recognize an international boundary. Loose criminal networks are also operational in the Comoros. As the local drug market grows, domestic criminal networks are developing and profiting, while Tanzanian networks importing heroin are well established. Criminal networks are mainly centred on human trafficking and child labour, exploiting the desires of families to move their children to Grande Comore. A significant number of people in the Comoros, especially fishermen, are employed by human-smuggling networks from Mayotte. ##&& In Comoros, the smuggling and trafficking of people is largely facilitated by state actors, but international syndicates are primarily responsible for the transportation of people to and from the islands. Tanzanian actors are predominantly involved in drug trafficking, while vanilla smuggling is suspected to be facilitated by Madagascan nationals. They also play a significant role in importing drugs and tortoises from Madagascar, but not in domestic distribution. There is no reported existence of mafia groups or equivalents in the Comoros.","text - leadership and governance":"There have been minimal efforts on the part of the government to curb organized crime, and a lack of political coordination between the three main islands hampers effective governance. The Comoros remains a fragile state, and since 2009, the government and the opposition have been at odds over attempts to change the constitution, which has taken all focus from tackling organized crime. The 2018 referendum resulted in the presidential term being extended and power being concentrated, contrary to the constitution limiting presidential terms and stipulating that the presidency must rotate between each of the three main islands. The referendum was boycotted by a large portion of the electorate and there have been concerns around vote rigging. The Comoros thus has one of the highest corruption perceptions globally and is often described as an emerging dictatorship. ##&& The Comoros is party to some international treaties pertaining to organized crime, but the country has been \u2018red-carded\u2019 by the EU and labelled as non-cooperative due to its insubstantial efforts to curb illegal fishing. Political relationships between the Comoros and France (relevant due to their proximity to Mayotte) fluctuate, but are generally difficult. There appear to be very few extradition agreements between the Comoros and other nations and international cooperation appears to be very limited. The legal system in the Comoros is hybrid in nature, using indigenous customary law, Islamic law and French civil law. The legal system is underdeveloped, and the legislative framework in place to combat organized crime is insufficient, falling below international standards.","text - criminal justice and security":"Courts are underresourced and overburdened in the Comoros. Courts in the country also suffer an undue degree of political interference from the executive, as demonstrated by the suspension of the constitutional court in 2018 by executive order from the president. The perception amongst stakeholders on the islands is that enforcement is weak and corruption is endemic throughout the judiciary and among members of the legal profession, leading to informal justice systems being preferred to the formal systems. Similarly, corruption is endemic in law enforcement and police officers are known to collude with criminal networks across a range of markets, actively facilitating criminal activities. The rule of law is weak in the Comoros and authorities show little interest in improving standards of training or in tackling issues of corruption and criminal facilitation. As the Comoros consists of three main islands, maintaining border security is difficult and the border police is underresourced. Maritime surveillance capacity is extremely limited, as is the security infrastructure at the two main ports of the islands. Informal ports and harbours across the islands enable smaller boats to disembark and dock undetected. It is also worth noting that the government refuses to recognize the national boundary between the Comoros and Mayotte.","text - economic and financial environment":"The financial system in the Comoros is underdeveloped and the country lacks the means to estimate proceeds of illicit activity. However, due to its underdeveloped financial system, many forms of sophisticated financial e-commerce crime are made impossible. Although money laundering is criminalized, policies are poorly implemented and systems for identifying instances of money laundering are weak. The Comoros does not have an environment suitable for businesses to thrive. Entrepreneurs are unsupported, most citizens are employed in the informal sector and regulatory capacity is extremely poor. The financial system is broadly mistrusted due to political interference and the justice system has provided more support to non-paying creditors than lending institutions.","text - civil society and social protection":"Insufficient support is offered to victims of organized crime, and human-trafficking victims are often housed by government employees themselves due to insufficient resources. There is also no support available for drug users, and civil-society organizations have to be privately funded and lack adequate resources. There are minimal measures in place to prevent organized crime, with the government\u2019s efforts to provide training and prevent trafficking in human beings severely lacking. Drugs are openly available in many parts of the islands, and there are limited arrests and no apparent targeting of high-level operators. Along with lack of funding and dependence on foreign donors, repressive measures have recently been taken against civil-society organizations as well as media outlets. After the controversial referendum in 2018, the media landscape has worsened considerably, with journalists experiencing a number of freedom violations, including arrests, attacks and intimidation. As a result, some journalists have been forced to flee Comoros. Strict defamation laws also impede freedom of press and contribute to the deteriorating media environment in the country.","Number of pages":"3","Capital":"Moroni","GDP (current $US million)":"1165.84","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"850886","Land Area (sq. km)":"1861","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"82.5","Freedom in the World Index":"42","Human Development Index":"0.55","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"3.09","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"21","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1370","1":"3.87","1.1":"3.85","1.2":"3.88","2":"2.38"},{"Corresp":"39","ISO-3":"COD","Country":"Congo, Dem.

Most trafficking occurs internally and takes the form of forced prostitution or child recruitment into armed groups. Despite being a source, transit and destination country for trafficking, detection remains difficult due to poor living standards and widespread human rights violations. ##&& Rampant conflict, violence and displacement in the DRC render human smuggling a crucial means of aiding vulnerable migrants in moving both through the country and abroad. However, human smuggling is not a common or lucrative trade, and the professional smugglers who do operate are often South African or Zimbabwean. The smuggling of Congolese migrants to Europe has increased in recent years among wealthier migrants, who are able to pay higher prices to smugglers.","text - trade":"Armed conflict in the DRC and its neighbouring states, combined with a porous border, has exacerbated arms trafficking in the country. The expansion of both local and foreign rebel groups has increased demand for illicit arms and ammunition trafficking, particularly between the DRC and the Central African Republic. Weapon ownership is high in the DRC, running into the hundreds of thousands. Moreover, government officials allegedly supply armed groups with weapons, meaning weapons are being diverted into illicit circulation. Despite knowledge of the problem, various governments worldwide continue to supply arms to the DRC.","text - environment":"The DRC is home to the largest tropical forest in Africa, but has suffered significant tree cover loss over the past decades. It is a country of origin for illicit high-value timber trafficked globally and generating significant income for criminal actors. Corruption is widespread in the timber supply chain, especially with the industrial logging concessions given to Chinese companies that engage in overexploitation, document fraud and logging outside of permitted areas. In 2014, almost 90% of logging activities were illegal in the country, and while much of the logging is carried out by large international companies, informal small-scale logging operations supply domestic markets. The DRC also plays a major role in the global illicit ivory supply chain, although stricter law enforcement policies have driven the market underground. Despite having its licence quota for pangolin scales suspended pending compliance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the DRC remains a logistical hub for pangolin scales, with seizures amounting to 16 tonnes in 2019. Certain species of great apes and monkeys are threatened by illegal bushmeat hunting, while armed groups and the military engage in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, often resulting in high levels of violence. ##&& The DRC has an abundance of non-renewable resources, creating large criminal markets. As a source country of gold, the illicit trade is widespread in the DRC with both pro-government and rebel militias profiting from the market. Diamonds are also extracted illegally and trafficked abroad. The UN Security Council reported that fraudulent documents were used to export gold to the United Arab Emirates, the country\u2019s main recipient of illicit gold. The DRC is also a source country for the so-called \u2018conflict materials\u2019 of tin, tungsten and tantalum. The latter illegal trade allegedly exploits child labour and sustains armed groups within the country, driving levels of violence up, including state-sponsored violence. Notably, the minerals mined are mostly purchased by China-based companies.","text - drugs":"The DRC serves as a transit country for heroin trafficked between eastern and southern regions of Africa into Europe. Heroin is primarily trafficked through Kinshasa\u2019s N\u2019djili International Airport, the port of Matadi and the ferry crossing between Kinshasa and Brazzaville in the Republic of the Congo. Domestic heroin consumption in the DRC is rising rapidly. The DRC is also a transit country for South American cocaine, and authorities have intercepted large shipments making their way to the country. In addition to that, domestic consumption is high, and the highly violent trade flourishes in the capital of Kinshasa. ##&& The DRC is a destination and source country for cannabis trafficked into neighbouring countries such as Uganda and Burundi. Cannabis consumption in the country is high, while domestic instability, the influence of armed rebel groups in the border regions, and high border porosity enable the cannabis trade to flourish. Conversely, the DRC\u2019s synthetic drug trade is very limited, although very limited methamphetamine consumption does occur.","text - criminal actors":"Armed groups are especially prevalent in the DRC\u2019s eastern provinces, with more than 100 active in North and South Kivu alone. These groups have expanded due to ethnic polarisation, insecurity and widespread human rights abuses, and they are thought to engage in civilian attacks and various forms of organized crime, especially wildlife crimes. Urban crime gangs have also proliferated in the major cities and often have ties to security force personnel and politicians. There are numerous criminal networks involved in the non-renewable resources market, operating both locally and transnationally in the DRC. These networks often comprise Congolese and foreign security personnel, customs officials, business leaders and politicians cooperating in the illegal export of ivory, pangolin scales and minerals. ##&& Corruption is rampant, and state-embedded actors at all levels are involved in organized crime. The state military is involved in arms trafficking, facilitating proxy militias to recruit child soldiers, and often carries out extrajudicial killings, rapes and extortion with impunity. Police officials often operate a \u2018coop system\u2019 where they resell stolen goods provided by youth gangs. Businesses linked to public figures have been accused of being involved in embezzlement and other corrupt business partnerships, while state officials accept bribes to issue logging permits to unlicensed loggers. The DRC has an international economy, especially in its abundant non-renewable resource markets, where Chinese businesses reportedly wield significant influence, alongside involvement from Lebanese and Indian businesses with close ties to the DRC\u2019s state authorities. Foreign criminal gangs also operate alongside state-embedded actors to facilitate the trafficking of drugs, arms and wildlife, coupled with fraudulent activities in the banking sector.","text - leadership and governance":"Political leadership and governance in the DRC are weak, undermined by the criminal activity of state-embedded actors. The 2018 elections split control of the executive and legislature and the president\u2019s lack of majority means he has very little control over parliament. Conflict and instability in governance are driven by the competition for control over the country\u2019s vast natural resources, particularly in the eastern provinces. Thus, the government is unable to control the security services that are implicated in criminal activity and provide support to rebel groups. The DRC is assessed as one of the states in the world that are the most fragile and vulnerable to conflict. Furthermore, state-owned companies dominate the extractive industries, lacking basic transparency and operating corrupt licensing practices. Although anti-corruption frameworks are in place, implementation and enforcement are woefully absent, and there have been accusations that politicians ran fake anti-corruption campaigns to garner Western support. ##&& In 2017, the EU announced sanctions against eight senior DRC government and security officials implicated in human-rights abuses, but since President Tshisekedi took office in 2019, he has ended the self-isolation policy and re-established good relations with the UN and the EU. He resurrected a regional platform for dialogue with neighbouring countries and the US has confirmed its support for a new anti-corruption agency. The DRC is party to a number of international treaties pertaining to organized crime. The country has legislated against organized crime, it has aimed to implement the Rome Statute and it has introduced a strategy against wildlife crimes. Regulations have also tightened in the extractive industries. However, the implementation of these laws is very poor and extortion practices are widespread, with the country falling well below the global average on rule-of-law markers.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judicial system is underfinanced, overburdened and lacks basic resources and training. Courts primarily exist in urban areas and most of the population does not have access to judicial services. Corruption and political interference are widespread, and the government has repeatedly used the judicial system to target its political opponents. The police forces are dysfunctional and ineffective, even in major cities and the capital, while local law enforcement\u2019s capacity to detect narcotics trafficking is inadequate. Corruption is widespread in the police force due to low salaries and poor treatment, meaning police intervention is limited and often involves illicit payments. The rule of law remains tenuous, allowing criminals to act with impunity. Politicization is rising in law enforcement as the army\u2019s high command remains in the Kabila clan\u2019s control, dividing the country\u2019s intelligence services between two centres of power. The DRC has a long and porous border with many unofficial crossing points. As a result of that, contraband flows freely over the border in the eastern regions, particularly the town of Ariwara. An illegal border post was established on the main road between the DRC and Zambia, and the border with the Central African Republic remains entirely uncontrolled.","text - economic and financial environment":"Rampant corruption, weak law enforcement, a dollarized economy and a dominant informal sector render the DRC\u2019s banking system highly vulnerable to money laundering. Under international pressure the DRC increased its anti-money laundering efforts in 2019 and it has since exposed several money laundering scandals. It is estimated that 70% of the country\u2019s economy is informal with political instability making economic reform very difficult. In particular, government attempts to reduce informal artisanal mining have allegedly failed, and at times resulted in violence in both the Kasai and Katanga regions. Pervasive patronage networks, bureaucratic inefficiency and political instability hinder international investment prospects.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government lacks established identification and referral mechanisms for victims of trafficking. However, some victims are referred to NGOs on an ad hoc basis. Most victims have either little recourse to state protection or have little trust in it. While the government has put measures in place to identify and refer child soldiers to international organizations, the same has not been done for victims of sex trafficking. Nevertheless, the DRC government has provided some financial support for the repatriation of Congolese victims of trafficking from abroad. The DRC meets less than a third of the requirements of international mechanisms to help victims exit modern slavery. The country puts some efforts into the prevention of children being recruited as child soldiers through the government\u2019s joint technical working group and curbs child labour in cobalt mines through the Fair Cobalt Alliance, financially backed by international private donors. There has also been an increase in law enforcement activities to end the illicit ivory trade, which has served to push the illicit market deeper underground rather than restrain it. ##&& Civil-society actors are diverse and focus on both the social and economic development of local communities. There are several international initiatives aiming to improve transparency and working conditions in the DRC\u2019s minerals supply chain and respond to wider issues, such as corruption. However, civil-society organizations are also vulnerable to political manipulation and corruption themselves and have also been split along pro-government and pro-opposition lines. However, relations between government and civil society have improved since 2018 and the election of the new president, with civil-society groups playing a key role in delivering social services and fighting corruption. However, the media landscape is extremely hostile and biased in favour of the government, with recent crackdowns on media critical of the government. Media outlets are often shut down, and in 2018, two journalists were murdered and two more disappeared. While the media landscape has improved slightly under the new president, censorship is still a major characteristic of DRC media.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Kinshasa","GDP (current $US million)":"50400.75","Income group":"Low income","Population":"86790567","Land Area (sq. km)":"2344860","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"108.4","Freedom in the World Index":"20","Human Development Index":"0.48","Global Peace Index":"3.24","Democracy Index":"1.13","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"18","GDP per capita (current US$)":"581","1":"7.75","1.1":"6.50","1.2":"9.00","2":"2.29"},{"Corresp":"40","ISO-3":"COG","Country":"Congo, Rep.","ISO-2":"CG","Continent":"Africa","Region":"Central Africa","Flag file":"cg.png","1.

There are about 40 000 people living in modern slavery in the country and Congo was identified as one of the countries to take the least action to prevent the practice. ##&& Amidst conflict, violence and high levels of displacement, human smuggling is a means of aiding vulnerable individuals to move within the country and beyond. Nevertheless, in many cases migrants travel to or through Congo without the assistance of professional smugglers. While human smuggling is not considered to be a particularly lucrative or high-profile crime in Congo, the practice is known to have been taxed by local territorial actors. Many irregular migrants in Congo also become vulnerable to human trafficking.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking played a large part in Congo\u2019s civil war and the conflicts in the DRC and Angola, but it is now residual. Arms are still trafficked and supplied to local militias, but the 2018 Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration programme resulted in the collection of 8 000 weapons. The domestic market for military-style weapons for use by poachers has grown in recent years, though these are supplied by private arms dealers rather than trafficking networks. Weapons made by the company Manufacture d\u2019Armes et de Cartouches Congolaises (MACC) in Pointe-Noire are smuggled out of Congo to be used by poachers and in the Central African Republic\u2019s civil war.","text - environment":"An estimated 70% of timber production in the country is illicit, including both small-scale domestic logging and large-scale exports. Illicit logging in Congo is primarily carried out by commercial enterprises, rather than explicit criminal networks, with investigations revealing alleged illegal obtaining of forest concessions in Lebama, the routine over-harvesting of timber and corporate tax avoidance. Poaching is another significant issue in protected regions of Congo and is primarily driven by bushmeat consumption and ivory trafficking. Park officials estimate that 40 000 tonnes of bushmeat were poached in 2018 alone. In particular, pangolins, parrots and other protected species are trafficked from Congo to neighbouring countries by organized regional trafficking networks. Given rising rates of poverty, an economic crisis and demographic growth, local villagers are increasingly involved in poaching and foreign trawlers also engage in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing off Congo\u2019s Atlantic coast. ##&& Despite being historically highly active, the extent of diamond smuggling between Congo and the DRC today is stymied by the fact that the tax regimes have removed any benefit of tax disparities that drive smuggling. Congo is one of Africa\u2019s largest oil-producing countries, and while there is little evidence to suggest a consolidated criminal economy, recent investigations have shown major indicators of corruption involving a number of foreign oil companies.","text - drugs":"Congo recently became involved in the global cocaine trade due to a direct air traffic line between Brazil and Pointe-Noire. The country primarily serves as a waypoint for South American cocaine trafficked to Europe, Angola or the DRC. In 2017, the Drug Enforcement Administration intercepted a ship destined for Pointe-Noire, the country\u2019s only harbour, carrying cocaine worth hundreds of millions of dollars trafficked out of Venezuela. The seizure revealed business connections between the Mexican Sinaloa cartel and Congolese criminal actors, including high-ranking state officials. ##&& The production of cannabis occurs in the country\u2019s Pool, Plateau and Likouala regions. Domestic cannabis consumption is very common, and most drug traffickers arrested by Congolese police are involved in cannabis trafficking. Conversely, no more than a few synthetic-drug seizures have been reported in Congo and as such, no evidence points to the existence of a significant synthetic-drug trade in the country. There are no indications of a significant heroin market in Congo either.","text - criminal actors":"Corruption runs rampant in the Congolese public sector, especially in the oil and timber industries. Many perceive the Congolese regime to be criminal, alleging that the president\u2019s family and ministers are involved in various economic crimes. The minister of forestry is, for instance, reportedly involved in facilitating the illicit logging industry, while members of the Congolese security forces have been accused of involvement in drug and wildlife trafficking. Criminal networks such as the Ninja and Cobra militiamen underwent disarmament processes after Congo\u2019s civil war ended in 2003. However, after reforming, and disbanding again in 2018, the groups allegedly kept most of their weapons, and many militiamen are suspected to be involved in, or responsible for, the so-called b\u00e9b\u00e9s noirs gangs. Criminal networks involved in bushmeat poaching and ivory trafficking are active in Congo\u2019s northern parks and protected areas. ##&& Given that the country\u2019s protected regions are located primarily in transborder regions, poaching networks often consist of foreign actors originating in neighbouring countries such as Cameroon and Gabon. Chinese companies are also reportedly involved in IUU fishing, illicit logging and ivory trafficking, and are suspected of being involved in money laundering operations. West and Central African foreign actors are also allegedly involved in human trafficking networks operating in Congo. Mafia-style structures are also present in Congo in the form of local youth gangs referred to as b\u00e9b\u00e9s noirs, or black babies. The latter operate in the Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire slums. These gangs are involved in petty crime and low-level drug trafficking, including cannabis and synthetic drugs.","text - leadership and governance":"The government has failed to address any form of organized crime, and the areas where it has legislated \u2013 human trafficking and wildlife crimes \u2013 are reported to be merely cosmetic efforts aimed at garnering Western support. Under pressure from the US, the government passed a law against human trafficking, and many believe the environmental concern expressed is not sincere. International conferences are hosted and national parks established, but the issue is not tackled seriously. The government\u2019s management of the country\u2019s natural wealth, primarily consisting of oil and timber, lacks transparency and accountability with exploration and exploitation rights being allocated opaquely. Under pressure from donors, the government recently established an independent anti-corruption observatory, however, it is reportedly regarded as a political tool to discard disgraced politicians. Notably, Congo has one of the highest corruption perception levels worldwide. ##&& Congo has a legal and regulatory framework aimed at combating various types of organized crime. International support has aided the development of a comprehensive legislative framework against wildlife crime in particular, including laws around ivory, poaching and fauna protection. The government also recently implemented a human trafficking law, which criminalizes sex as well as labour trafficking.","text - criminal justice and security":"Congo\u2019s judiciary lacks independence and suffers from both widespread corruption and political interference. Prosecutions in human-trafficking cases are often delayed for years, and reports indicate that anti-trafficking activists are often harassed by government officials and police officers. Since 2010, the country\u2019s courts have failed to either prosecute or convict suspected traffickers. Although criminals have been sentenced for wildlife crimes, they often receive amnesty later, which means that many poachers are not first-time offenders and continue to engage in poaching with impunity. Congo\u2019s law enforcement is also plagued by widespread corruption but, with the support of international organizations, the government has boosted its training for law enforcement officials. Through cooperation with international organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund, the establishment of the anti-poaching police and better information-sharing mechanisms among law-enforcement agencies have increased the number of convictions for wildlife crimes. Despite recent improvements under pressure from the US, Congo\u2019s law enforcement is failing to meet the set standards for the elimination of human trafficking. ##&& Congo\u2019s capacity to monitor both its land and sea borders is low, largely due to rampant corruption in state security agencies. Smuggling of contraband and wildlife between Congo and the DRC is commonplace, particularly between Brazzaville and Kinshasa. Due to the regional nature of the bushmeat market, wildlife poached in Congo is also trafficked out of the country to the DRC, Gabon and Cameroon. Moreover, the Angolan army is known to have infiltrated southern regions of Congo in its efforts to attack Cabinda rebels.","text - economic and financial environment":"While few banks operate in Congo, the country is a member of the anti-money laundering Task Force on Money Laundering in Central Africa, or GABAC. Money laundering through both domestic and foreign real estate investments is reportedly on the rise. Files of the US government\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also reveal suspicious bank transfers between Congo, the UK and Switzerland. As a result, the president\u2019s nephew has been indicted in France on money laundering charges. Congo is also facing a severe economic crisis with dropping oil prices, which are significantly limiting the government\u2019s spending ability. The lack of regular pay for civil servants \u2013 teachers, nurses and doctors among other, has led to a number of strikes. Despite restructured debts with China and an International Monetary Fund bailout of US$449 million, Congo\u2019s debt remains unsustainable. The country\u2019s weak economic regulatory protections and the severe economic crisis puts Congo among the worst countries worldwide in which to do business.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government\u2019s efforts to aid trafficking victims is focused solely on West African children subjected to forced labour in Pointe-Noire. There have been no efforts to identify or assist victims in other cities or of any forms of exploitation other than forced labour. The government lacks systematic identification and referral procedures and fails to provide any residency status to trafficking victims. With the exception of prevention efforts aimed at curbing wildlife trafficking, organized-crime prevention remains extremely limited in Congo. Wildlife trafficking prevention activities are implemented by both government entities and international conservation organizations, and while government efforts to prevent human trafficking have improved in recent years, they remain inadequate. Nevertheless, an anti-trafficking coordination committee in Pointe-Noire has been established and the government has conducted public awareness campaigns on human trafficking. Regardless, the Congo government lacks a comprehensive and adequate national action plan against human trafficking. Civil-society organizations in Congo are extremely weak and focus solely on public-sector corruption. As such, civil-society activists often face intimidation and threats, and some have died under mysterious circumstances. Several activists from the Ras-le-bol citizen movement were either arrested or intimidated, and journalists investigating corruption, the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, or oil corruption were sanctioned. During both the Pool Insurgency and the last election, the Congo government visibly cracked down on civil-society organizations and its opposition.

C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is also a destination country for foreign victims of human trafficking. Forced labour of boys and men from Ghana, Mali and Burkina Faso exists in the agricultural, mining and construction sectors. Girls and women recruited from Ghana, Togo and Benin are often trafficked to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to work as domestic servants. The phenomenon of trafficking within Quranic schools has also been documented. Many human-trafficking victims are vulnerable migrants who seek economic opportunities in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and fall prey to traffickers by deception or force. ##&& Due to a range of pushfactors, including unemployment and ongoing socio-political and military crises, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire experiences high rates of out-migration. As a result, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is a source country of irregular migrants and refugees who will often seek the services of human-smuggling groups and networks that facilitate the journey towards Europe. Indeed, citizens of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire make up a relatively significant number of the irregular migrants who have arrived on European-Mediterranean coasts in the past decade. This route most often goes through countries such as Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Algeria and Libya. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is also a destination and transit country for citizens of other West African states seeking economic opportunities, stability or a point of departure towards other destinations. Despite the freedom of movement among the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), many migrants from countries such as Burkina Faso and Mali enter C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire illegally.

Illegal logging, another key environmental criminal market, has been a widespread issue for decades and has substantially reduced C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s forest resources and forest cover. While most of these losses are linked to farming activities, illegal harvesting of timber is responsible forsubstantial deforestation. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is both a source and transit country for illicit wildlife products, with pangolin scales and elephant ivory being the two most trafficked wildlife products. These products originate from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire as well as other West African countries such as Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria and Liberia, and are likely bound predominantly for destination markets in Asia.

Foreign actors also have extensive involvement in criminal markets in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. For instance, local drug trafficking networks have strong ties to drug cartels from Central and South America and prominent European mafia-style groups. Trafficking in wildlife products often occurs in cooperation with South East Asian criminal actors. Foreign criminal and terrorist activities are also on the rise in the northern parts of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. ##&& Domestic criminal actors with mafia-like characteristics have a limited presence in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and are for the most part engaged in human trafficking, particularly of children.

","text - leadership and governance":"C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is recovering from two decades of civil conflict and political instability. Although the country remains fragile, governance has steadily improved in the last 10 years and the government of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has shown an interest in strengthening inclusive and democratic institutions. The government has made headway in addressing corruption, has installed a basic anti-corruption institutional framework and has implemented some initiatives to improve accountability and transparency. However, corruption remains an acute and endemic issue, calling for continued and increased efforts in strengthening integrity systems and transparent governance. ##&& The government of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire closely cooperates with relevant international organizations on fighting organized crime. These include the UN Organization on Drugs and Crime, INTERPOL, the European Union, ECOWAS, and foreign donors and governments, in several sponsored programmes. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has also ratified a number of international instruments pertaining to organized crime and terrorism. The country is a member of the regional ECOWAS extradition conventions and maintains bilateral extradition treaties with neighbouring countries and France. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has laws related to organized crime, including one that criminalizes organized criminal groups.

Conditions in prisons are inadequate, with reports of overcrowding and corruption prevailing inside detention facilities. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has a number of units dedicated to combating organized crime, but the overall ability of law enforcement authorities continues to be seriously undermined by corruption and lack of capacity. There are, however, ongoing internationally supported reform efforts aiming to strengthen both law enforcement and judicial institutions in the country.

Moreover, while the country\u2019s economy has been diversifying, the complexity of its export baskets remains limited. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has taken steps towards promotinga more open and competitive environment conducive to economic development and structural transformation. Donors and international partners also continue to push the government to make reforms. ##&& C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has significant deficiencies in its anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism framework, making it vulnerable to illicit money flows. The country performed poorly on its 2012 initial mutual evaluation report, receiving ratings of non-compliance in most core recommendations. The digitalization of government systems may have had a positive impact on the country\u2019s resilience to money laundering, but C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire remains vulnerable overall.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim and witness support mechanisms are generally lacking.

Djibouti is a country of origin, a waypoint and a destination market for children, men and women trafficked for sexual and labour exploitation. Victims are mainly Ethiopian and Somali economic migrants destined for the Arabian Gulf. While a sizeable proportion of migrants are subjected to labour and sexual exploitation at their ultimate places of destination, many are also held for ransom in Djibouti. Although limited data complicates the accurate assessment of the extent of the issue, modern slavery does occur on a relatively large scale in the country. ##&& Human smuggling is one of the most prevalent forms of organized crime in Djibouti. It is a significant transit country for most Ethiopian and Somali migrants smuggled from the Horn of Africa to the Arabian Peninsula by sea. The country\u2019s proximity to Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen renders it a key transit point for human smugglers who move refugees, mercenaries and irregular migrants both into and out of these conflict-affected areas. At present, migrants smuggled through Djibouti are predominantly Ethiopian, as Somalis reportedly now travel to Yemen primarily via Puntland in Somalia. Djiboutian smuggling networks often operate out of Tadjoura and leverage contacts in source communities in Ethiopia. Human smuggling networks first organize border crossings into Djibouti, and later facilitate movement to the port city of Obock, where boat departures to Yemen are arranged. Given the high number of migrants attempting to transit the country, Djibouti offers an increasingly lucrative opportunity for human smugglers and, as a result, the human smuggling industry has increased in both sophistication and capacity in recent years. Human smuggling operations can be ad hoc and informal, or organized, or operations in which the perpetrators hold migrants hostage at different points of their journey to extort additional taxes from their families.","text - trade":"Situated in one of the most fragile and conflict-affected regions in the world, Djibouti has emerged as an increasingly central arms trafficking hub. The flow of arms across Djiboutian ports and borders with conflict-affected neighbours is increasing at alarming levels. Much ammunition and many arms and landmines appear to originate from Houthi-controlled territories in Yemen, and are trafficked through Djibouti by a variety of criminal networks, including Iranian, Turkish and Yemeni groups that support actors involved in the conflicts in Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia. A significant portion of arms traffickers reportedly uses small islands off Djibouti\u2019s coast as staging grounds for their operations. Moreover, military and government officials, the African Union Mission in Somalia and executives of state-owned enterprises, all seem to be tied to companies engaged in sponsoring and aiding the trafficking of arms in the Horn of Africa. The illicit flow of arms into Djibouti has also been linked to the country\u2019s conflict with neighbouring Eritrea.","text - environment":"Djibouti is both an origin and a transit country for illicit goods such as ivory, rhino horn, wild animal skins and live animals. Strong evidence suggests that wild animals, including cheetahs, leopards and lions, are trafficked through Djibouti to Yemen on their way to exotic pet markets in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates or other destination markets in Asia, Europe or the Middle East. Illicit wildlife products are known to depart via the Dewele border crossing between Ethiopia and Djibouti. Additionally, gazelles, as well as nesting seabirds and marine turtles \u2013 for their eggs and meat \u2013 are also poached in the Eritrean Coastal Desert, an eco-region that is part of Djibouti\u2019s Red Sea coast. Moreover, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is known to occur in Djibouti\u2019s territorial waters. Evidence of illicit activity in Djibouti\u2019s diamond, gold, oil, coloured gemstones and coal trades is limited. However, Djibouti is becoming a transit country for gold smuggled between Ethiopia and the Persian Gulf. Similarly, there is little criminal activity related to the illicit trade or trafficking of flora species in or through Djibouti.","text - drugs":"While there is no evidence of a significant consumer base and its role in the global drug trade is not substantial, Djibouti is a waypoint for heroin trafficked from Southern, Western and South-eastern Asia as well as cannabis trafficked from Southern Asia to East Africa. Weak border controls and high border porosity enable transport of heroin and cannabis into and out of Djibouti with relative ease. The criminal markets for cocaine and various synthetic drugs are very small and trafficking cases are isolated.","text - criminal actors":"Criminal networks in Djibouti engage in both human trafficking and human smuggling from Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen to Persian Gulf countries. These criminal networks are believed to consist overwhelmingly of Djiboutian nationals, although many such networks also have links to counterparts in Ethiopia and Yemen. Criminal networks in Djibouti are also believed to engage in arms trafficking between Yemen and Turkey to various other East African countries. Multiple foreign criminal systems operate in Djibouti, including Somali hawala networks and Yemeni, Iranian and Turkish arms trafficking networks. Evidence suggests that high-level Djiboutian government officials profit from corrupt activities and that state-embedded actors (such as the Djiboutian secret police) accept, and potentially profit from, criminal markets such as human smuggling. Conversely, there is no indication of mafia-style groups operating in the country.","text - leadership and governance":"Although a peace agreement was reached in 1994, ending the Djiboutian Civil War, clashes continue in the country and Djibouti remains somewhat fragile. Authorities in Djibouti do not have the capacity and resources to respond to and tackle the country\u2019s human trafficking and human smuggling issues. The government has claimed that it has limited available policy options as criminal markets are driven by external events in Ethiopia and Yemen. Nevertheless, while these constraints remain, the Djiboutian government has increased its efforts to address human trafficking and smuggling in particular. Djibouti continues to suffer from endemic corruption, but the country has strengthened its anti-corruption framework in the last couple of years, particularly by erecting the National Commission for Anti-Corruption and setting up a new asset declaration system. Transparency and accountability in the country are undermined by the government, evident in the harsh crackdown on the anti-government demonstrations in 2020. ##&& Djibouti is party to most international agreements pertaining to organized crime, including the UNTOC and the UNCAC. However, despite being viewed as an arms-trafficking hub, the country has not yet ratified the Arms Trade Treaty. Djibouti cooperates in a number of regional and international initiatives and organizations, including the East Africa Police Chiefs Cooperation Organisation, INTERPOL, MENAFATF and the Horn of Africa Wildlife Enforcement Network. Djibouti also exhibits strong relationships with Arab-speaking countries, as well as with France and French-speaking countries, and has also expanded international cooperation with Turkey, Brazil, Senegal, the Netherlands, Morocco and other countries through bilateral and multilateral relationships that focus on capacity-building for law enforcement agencies. Djibouti maintains political exchange agreements on human trafficking and human smuggling with other Intergovernmental Authority on Development member states. However, except for Ethiopia, no regular technical exchanges occur. An Ethio-Djibouti commission functions to counter issues related to smuggling, contraband trade and the trafficking of arms along the border between Djibouti and Ethiopia, but concerns regarding the forceful repatriation of migrants and human rights violations in the work of the commission have been raised. The country is also part of the Lom\u00e9 Charter, which seeks to establish mechanisms to tackle transnational crime at sea. However, no evidence points to the efficacy of these measures. Djibouti has a legal framework in place to address organized crime, which includes an anti-human trafficking legislation, but the implementation of these laws remains a challenge.","text - criminal justice and security":"Djibouti\u2019s judiciary lacks independence and capacity, and suffers high levels of corruption. Allegations of politically motivated prosecutions are common and the right to due process is frequently violated. Prison conditions remain severe due to overcrowding, failure to separate violent and non-violent offenders (including detained migrants) and numerous reported cases of mistreatment in prisons. However, recent years have seen significant improvements in Djibouti\u2019s prison system. No specialized units aimed at countering organized crime exist within Djibouti\u2019s judiciary or law enforcement. Nevertheless, law enforcement agencies such as the national police, gendarmerie, intelligence service, coast guard, immigration and border management, and the Ministry of Justice engage in preventing and suppressing instances of organized crime. Although fairly efficient, law enforcement faces challenges in terms of training standards, equipment and communication and has limited capacities in, for instance, forensic services. Corruption also remains a persistent constraint on the efficacy of law enforcement in fighting organized crime.

Conversely, control over illicit financial transactions and the hawala system remain significant issues. An anti-money laundering framework is in place in Djibouti, and a financial intelligence unit (FIU) was established in 2016. Nevertheless, the implementation of anti-money laundering regulations is lacking and authorities, including the FIU and the central bank, lack the capacity and expertise needed to adequately combat financial crimes.","text - civil society and social protection":"While the Djiboutian government has pledged to combat human trafficking, drug trafficking and arms trafficking, statements regarding provisions for prisoners or rehabilitation and treatment programmes for drug users remain scarce and witness protection inadequate. However, while it continues to fail in many areas of victim support, authorities have pushed to build up their capacity to protect victims of human trafficking, and now allows civil society organizations to support human trafficking victims. Similarly, more efforts have been dedicated to a more adequate response to human smuggling, which includes the funding of migrant response centres and mobile health clinics and repatriating irregular migrants in a seemingly orderly fashion. NGOs also operate a number of protective services, particularly for victims of human trafficking. Djibouti lacks national organized-crime prevention strategies, but there have been sporadic attempts made by national security services to take preventive approaches to organized crime. Djibouti\u2019s ruling party places serious constraints on the capabilities of the opposition in the country to function, and both civil society organizations and journalists critical of the incumbent regime are regularly harassed, arrested or censored. Djibouti thus has a very poor record of respecting civil liberties.

Irregular migrants from the Horn of Africa and Eastern Africa are smuggled through Egypt towards Europe, using boats that depart from the Egyptian Mediterranean shores. However, human smuggling from the Egyptian Mediterranean peaked in 2016 and 2017.

","text - trade":"Arms trafficking is a serious issue in Egypt and controlling the circulation of arms has been a challenge for Egyptian law enforcement agencies andauthorities. The situation is particularly critical in the Sinai region, where armed non-state actors have a heavy presence and are deeply involved in the illicit arms trade. Egypt may also play an important role in international arms trafficking, with numerous reports of international arms trafficking operations involving Egypt as a transit country. Additionally, Egypt\u2019s proximity to Libya and Egyptian actors\u2019 involvement in the Libyan crisis presents several arms trafficking opportunities, significantly increasing the size of the criminal market.","text - environment":"The main environmental criminal markets in Egypt are those for fauna and gold. Egypt is both a source and a destination country for illegal wildlife products. Protected species, including the Egyptian tortoise, falcons and fennecs, are trafficked into illegal pet markets or for traditional medicine, while poached birds of prey are sold on the criminal fauna markets in the Arabian Gulf countries. There have been reports of poachers taking advantage of the relative lack of law enforcement in desert areas of the Sinai to hunt protected animals such as the ibex, wild donkeys, oryx and Dorcas gazelles. The Egyptian black market is reportedly a destination for imported exotic animals including apes, felines and crocodiles originating in countries such as Libya, Nigeria and Cameroon.Moreover, bird poaching is a relatively widespread issue. Birds traded illegally are primarily songbirds such as finches, pipits and larks, which are either sold in local markets (often used for cooking) or trafficked abroad. Recent years have seen some ivory seizures, coming from countries such as South Sudan, Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Although Egypt is not a major exporter of gold, the country does host a criminal market for gold. Gold mining takes place in both the southern and northern parts of Egypt, however, in addition to the gold of Egyptian origin, there is also a criminal market for smuggled Sudanese gold. Oil smuggling in Egypt may happen, particularly because of the fuel price difference between Egypt and Libya, which provides economic incentives for smuggling. However, there is little evidence on the nature of this potential criminal market. There is little evidence of systematized illicit flora trafficking in Egypt.","text - drugs":"Tramadol is one of Egypt\u2019s most consumed and trafficked drugs and Egypt was one of the first countries in Africa to face a sustained Tramadol epidemic. Tramadol tends to be smuggled into Egypt from Libya or via maritime routes. Furthermore, there is some outbound smuggling of the drug, notably to Gaza. Tramadol also transits onward through North Africa and into West African consumer markets, particularly Nigeria. Despite strong laws forbidding its consumption, cannabis use is widespread in Egypt. The majority of cannabis consumed in Egypt derives from Morocco and Afghanistan, but there is also a supplementary supply of domestically cultivated cannabis. A persistent and growing domestic heroin market also exists in Egypt with evidence suggesting that heroin is relatively easy to access and has a somewhat high consumer base. Moreover, due to its geographical position, Egypt is an important transit point for heroin of Asian origin moving towards Europe, the rest of Africa and the United States. With cocaine consumption being limited to a very narrow base of consumers and relatively minor seizures, the cocaine market in Egypt overall is negligible.","text - criminal actors":"Corruption is widespread in Egypt and seemingly occurs at all levels of the state apparatus, including in law enforcement.

Foreign criminal actors in Egypt include nationals of Sudan, Libya and various countries in Asia and the Middle East. ##&& There are multiple prominent criminal networks with a presence in Egypt. These have significant transnational linkages and are involved in criminal markets such as human trafficking and human smuggling. Politically motivated and militant actors may play a major role in some of the criminal markets in Egypt. These include several violent extremist groups such as the Islamic State, various other Salafist militant organizations and smaller splinter groups containing radicalized former members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Mafia-style actors are known to operate in Egypt, primarily in trafficking and smuggling operations between Egypt and Sudan, Israel and Libya.","text - leadership and governance":"Egypt has been described as an authoritarian regime with limited civil liberties, but the government aims to take a leading position in Africa, spearheading efforts on issues linked to organized crime and violent extremism. However, Egyptian authorities often fight crime and terrorism in a heavy-handed manner that lacks strategic cohesion and accountability and are in violation of human-rights norms. Egypt suffers a grave lack of transparency in governance and entrenched corruption across government institutions. The country\u2019s integrity systems are currently not capable of adequately checking corruption risks and do not operate independently. Meanwhile, Egypt\u2019s track record on international cooperation on combating transnational organized crime is mixed. ##&& The country is party to a number ofinternational treaties pertaining to organized crime.

Egypt\u2019s prison system is generally believed to be overcrowded and to suffer poor sanitary conditions. Law enforcement strategies against organized crime and terrorism often rely on heavy-handed methods such as arbitrary arrests and torture rather than more coherent and methodological approaches. Egypt's law enforcement thus lacks human-rights-compliant specialized capacity to counter organized crime groups effectively.Additionally, the state\u2019s control over some of Egypt\u2019s borderlands is occasionally in question, while the state\u2019s monopoly on violence in Sinai has eroded, allowing armed actors to operate freely.","text - economic and financial environment":"Prior to the current global health crisis, Egypt\u2019s economy was on a trajectory of reform and stabilization with medium levels of growth.

Some cannabis cultivated in Equatorial Guinea is trafficked to Gabon via the Muni River. With regards to heroin, there is very little evidence to suggest that trafficking or significant use occurs in Equatorial Guinea. Reportedly, diplomats from the country have previously been involved in heroin smuggling. Given regional transit flows, it seems likely that some heroin may still be trafficked through the country. There are no reports of cocaine or synthetic-drug trafficking or production in Equatorial Guinea, and consumption of most drugs in the country is either non-existent or negligible at most.","text - criminal actors":"State-embedded criminal actors in Equatorial Guinea are a major part of the criminal landscape, with substantial allegations of high-level officials profiting from corruption. The political elite live lavish lifestyles thanks to vast revenues generated by the country\u2019s oil industry. Foreign authorities have conducted investigations into the presidential family and its alleged network for laundering embezzled funds, filing cases to recover millions of dollars in assets. Cases brought to trial in the United States, France and Spain demonstrate repeated embezzlement by high-level officials. Corruption in the logging sector involves state-embedded actors awarding concessions fraudulently, failing to provide proper oversight or penalties for firms not observing felling or export limits. The conviction of the country's vice-resident, also son of the president, Teodorin Obiang, in the French court for laundering proceeds from his shell timber firms, highlights the extent to which the market is embedded in the state apparatus. ##&& Although criminal groups involved in human trafficking in Equatorial Guinea are known to exist, publicly available data is lacking. There is also little information on foreign criminal actors operating in the country. However, unregulated logging is the foundation of Equatorial Guinea\u2019s bilateral ties with the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Until 2018, several DPRK entities were situated within Equatorial Guinea\u2019s forests. Moreover, several Lebanese families, which broadcast statements supportive of Hezbollah, dominate other segments of Equatorial Guinea\u2019s forest concession and transport sectors. There is no evidence to suggest the presence of mafia-like structures in the country.","text - leadership and governance":"President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, in power since 1979, has been described as one of Africa\u2019s most brutal dictators and worst abusers of human rights. Equatorial Guinea is described as a kleptocracy and a country whose corrupt leaders use their powers to exploit people and natural resources, embezzling funds at the expense of the population. Notably, the government has never prosecuted or convicted any human-trafficking suspects. Furthermore, embezzlement of public funds, fraud and corruption is endemic within the state apparatus, largely surrounding the extractive industries. Additionally, the most common crime is extortion by corrupt police officers, and although the government passed strict anti-corruption laws, these have not been enforced. ##&& Although Equatorial Guinea has ratified international legal instruments pertaining to organized crime, it is not party to key international agreements regarding corruption and bribery. As a member of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), however, Equatorial Guinea has agreed to regulations to suppress terror financing as well as regional cooperation on criminal police matters. The government also claims to actively participate in all initiatives seeking to normalize the security situation in the Gulf of Guinea. In 2011, Equatorial Guinea signed a regional action plan to strengthen enforcement of national wildlife laws and improve cooperation with regard to poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. However, enforcement is still lacking. National laws address corruption and organized crime, including human, arms and drug trafficking, human smuggling, and fauna- and flora-related crimes, but these are not adequately enforced, allowing state-embedded actors to operate with impunity. Human-rights abuses have also continued, despite the introduction of an anti-torture decree banning all forms of abuse.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judicial system is not independent, as the president is the chief magistrate, and no specialized judicial units exist to counter organized crime. Since the implementation of the law addressing human trafficking and smuggling, neither convictions of traffickers nor prosecution of trafficking cases have been reported. Minimal anti-trafficking law-enforcement efforts have been made, and police have a limited presence in major cities and rural areas, often engaging in extortion. National security forces are accused of engaging in torture as well as other violence during interrogations with impunity. Scarce judicial capacity is enabled by corruption at all levels of government, including the judiciary. Occasionally, business disputes are treated as criminal cases and passports of foreign managers are confiscated until the case is resolved. Notably, in 2018, authorities built a new prison in response to criticism of human-rights abuses. ##&& Equatorial Guinea encompasses 64 islands, a coastline of significant length, and land borders with Cameroon and Gabon. While the state receives vast financial resources to control borders, there is no strong political will to protect territory and infrastructure against organized crime.","text - economic and financial environment":"The implementation and enforcement of anti-money laundering laws are weak, and officials have often been investigated by foreign authorities for money laundering and corruption. The exploitation of large oil and gas reserves were key drivers of strong economic growth, which has in recent years, notably in 2020, decreased due to fluctuating oil prices and declining production. Although there are regulations in place requiring certain anti-money laundering measures, such as compliance programmes and suspicious transaction reports among others, these are rarely implemented by financial institutions in Equatorial Guinea. There are no measures in place to tackle most common way of laundering money in the country, cross-border currency transactions and international law-enforcement cooperation on the issue of money laundering is weak. Equatorial Guinea is also a member of the Task Force on Money Laundering in Central Africa, although the country has not had a mutual evaluation to assess compliance with Financial Action Task Force recommendations. ##&& In spite of the government actively soliciting foreign investment, Equatorial Guinea is among the worst-performing countries as far as doing business goes, due to difficulties with setting up a business, trading across borders and paying taxes. In addition, foreign assistance programmes of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have been cut since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement.","text - civil society and social protection":"Although the government have reportedly increased efforts to identify potential victims of human trafficking, protection efforts are extremely weak. Furthermore, the government does not have a witness-protection programme. Although anti-trafficking legislation in the country imposes an obligation on the government to provide various services and provisions to victims of human trafficking, they do not do so, instead placing the burden on NGOs. Authorities have not initiated any human-trafficking awareness campaigns, implemented any programmes to address forced child labour, or made any efforts to prevent trafficking. This inactivity characterizes the government\u2019s preventive efforts towards all other criminal markets as well. For example, there is no evidence of any harm reduction measures in place in the country with regard to drug use. ##&& Obiang has systematically sought to repress the freedom of the press, reflected in the poor media environment and government control over media outlets in Equatorial Guinea. Domestic broadcast media is extremely limited, and any outlets that do operate are almost entirely controlled by the Obiang regime. Most of the population does not use the internet, which is also heavily governed by official authorities. The government is accused of constant human rights violations and the persecution of political opposition by various civil-society organizations. Freedom of association and assembly is also severely curtailed, with the government imposing restrictive conditions on the registration and operation of NGOs. Protests are not permitted, and police will attempt to disperse any such crowds, including by force. The few civil-society activists who work on human rights-related issues are often face intimidation, harassment and reprisals.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Malabo","GDP (current $US million)":"11026.77","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"1355986","Land Area (sq. km)":"28050","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"84.1","Freedom in the World Index":"5","Human Development Index":"0.59","Global Peace Index":"1.89","Democracy Index":"1.92","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"16","GDP per capita (current US$)":"8132","1":"4.12","1.1":"3.85","1.2":"4.38","2":"2.17"},{"Corresp":"55","ISO-3":"ERI","Country":"Eritrea","ISO-2":"ER","Continent":"Africa","Region":"East Africa","Flag file":"er.png","1.

Indefinite state-sponsored conscription, functioning essentially as bonded labour, breeds resentment and significant emigration. This compulsory national service continues despite increasing international pressure to reintroduce 18-month limits. Eritrean emigrants continue to be extremely vulnerable to trafficking, usually upon leaving the county. ##&& Eritrea is therefore one of the most significant refugee-producing countries in Africa. Human smuggling is exacerbated by strict exit control procedures, limited passport issuance and the militarization of borders following the war with Ethiopia. Smugglers are often contacted by the families of individuals abroad who pay significant rates. Members of the Eritrean diaspora likely remain entrenched within sophisticated human-smuggling networks with links to the political class and top-level civil servants and diplomats in embassies throughout Africa and the Middle East. Improvements in the country\u2019s relations with Ethiopia and the reopening of some border points resulted in an influx of Eritreans crossing the border, but following their reclosure, dependence on smuggling networks resumed. Senior military officers reportedly remain entrenched in the smuggling of Eritreans for private gain, resulting in the frequent abuse of smuggled individuals.","text - trade":"Eritrea has been isolated for over two decades, but is strategically located on the Red Sea with two functioning ports, namely Massawa and Assab. The country subsequently serves as a trans-shipment point for arms trafficking to neighbouring embargoed states including Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia. Eritrea has a long history of armed conflict with Ethiopia and Djibouti. During the conflicts, the illicit flow of arms moved in all directions from various sources. While Eritrea was subjected to an arms embargo between 2011 and 2018, it remained a transit route for arms trafficking, primarily to Sudan. It is likely, following the lifting of the arms embargo in late 2018, that the flow of weapons through Eritrea to Sudan has increased. To date, the country remains among the countries in the Horn of Africa with the highest prevalence of firearms. Given the state and ruling party\u2019s dominant role in the economy, including its monopoly on all imports, actors with ties to the state or state-embedded actors are likely involved in arms trafficking.","text - environment":"Since 2016, the Horn of Africa has emerged as a major source and transit region of wildlife products, mainly ivory, rhino horn, skins of wild animals and live animals. Historically, however, ivory poaching has not been of major concern. Eritrea plays only a minor role in this illegal trade, although Massawa port is used to ship ivory trafficked towards Asia. Despite its location in a region with considerable illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, the issue does not appear to be significant in Eritrea. With regards to flora-related crimes, there are few reports on illegal deforestation, logging, or other forms of flora trafficking conducted by criminal groups. While deforestation has been cited as a concern, there is scant reporting of it being linked to organized crime. However, military involvement has been cited in illegal logging. Additionally, low-level smuggling of cactus species to the Middle East may occur, as well as the illicit trade of gum arabic and frankincense. ##&& Gold from Sudan appears to be smuggled through Eritrea to the United Arab Emirates, although there is little evidence of this occurring systematically. Gold smuggled out of the country due to current sanctions is the second-largest export from Eritrea. A small number of actors are involved, primarily the elite, and only a small part of the country is affected. Compared to other countries in Africa, the level of smuggling is fairly low. However, all mining companies run the risk of complicity in Eritrea\u2019s forced labour system.","text - drugs":"Drug use in Eritrea is reportedly one of the lowest in the world, and there is very little evidence of a criminal market around synthetic drugs or domestic cocaine or heroin use. However, Eritrea\u2019s ports have become increasingly important along the heroin smuggling routes from Southern Asia to Europe and the Americas, and instances of cocaine trafficking cannot be ruled out. The ports of Eritrea have also become key points along the cannabis smuggling routes from Southern Asia to Europe and the Americas. Cultivation within Eritrea is relatively widespread, although there is little evidence of cannabis being cultivated for large-scale commercial supply or trafficking.","text - criminal actors":"Given their dominance in the economy and the authority they maintain in society, organized criminal activity is likely largely limited to state and military actors, and individuals closely associated with them. Members of the government have taken part in transnational organized crime, and the state actors are perceived by most Eritreans as a mafia. Diplomats posted abroad, especially those in Sudan, are prone to bribery in order to provide legal services or issue documents for travel to Eritrean citizens. Thus, diplomats allegedly facilitate human trafficking. Other state officials, however, have also been found involved in criminal activity. A case in point is police and military personnel, engaged in trafficking along the Sudanese border. In addition to state-embedded actors, transnational networks of Eritrean smugglers operate on routes towards Europe. Those operating within Eritrea are often from the same communities as the smuggled individuals. Rashaida traffickers, who have been aided by Eritreans, are known to operate along the Eritrea\u2014Sudan border and allegedly kidnap and hold individuals for ransom in the Sinai peninsula or in Libya. ##&& While there are no notable mafia groups in Eritrea, the state itself is highly criminalized, allowing few foreign criminal actors to operate in the country. Nevertheless, there have been speculations over the possible involvement of criminal actors from Sudan or Egypt in Eritrean criminal markets.","text - leadership and governance":"Eritrea is deemed an authoritarian state controlled by President Isaias Afwerki. The latter heads the People\u2019s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), which is Eritrea\u2019s sole political party and has been in power since 1991. President Afwerki has been historically extremely dismissive of any suggestions of political reform. Thus, no elections have been held in the country since 1993, when Eritrea gained its independence from Ethiopia. Since then, the government has held little regard for rights and freedoms and has violated the human rights of its citizens with impunity, while the security services have operated free of any civilian oversight. Authorities follow formal and informal systems and exert almost total control over the economy. The lifting of the United Nations\u2019 sanctions and strengthening of relations with Ethiopia following a prolonged state of \u2018no war, no peace\u2019 has, to date, had little effect on governance. The government does not publish reliable data regarding the economy and crime dynamics, and has been criticized for its lack of transparency. Furthermore, recent attempts by external actors to support domestic data gathering and the publication of statistics have been shunned. ##&& Eritrea is party to a number of international treaties relevant to anti-organized crime. Since 2018, the country has taken steps towards normalizing and strengthening relations with some neighbouring countries and Somalia. Its relations with the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the African Union, several UN agencies, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), remain strained. However, the government has made steps to build partnerships and strengthen its capacities to counter human trafficking. Additionally, Eritrean authorities have co-hosted training seminars with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime for key government stakeholders on human trafficking, and contributed to a regional plan of action on combating trafficking. Engagement with external entities on such matters represents a significant departure from previous practice. Eritrea has a number of laws pertaining to organized crime, but in spite of having an approved constitution, it has not yet been enforced. Nonetheless, the penal code criminalizes some forms of organized crime, including human trafficking. In addition, Eritrea joined the Elephant Protection Initiative to support its small population of elephants in the Gash-Setit wildlife reserve.","text - criminal justice and security":"Eritrea has no independent judiciary, national assembly, or other democratic institutions. The resulting power vacuum has given rise to an environment where human rights violations and impunity persist. There are no judiciary-related specialized units with the specific aim of countering organized crime, and prison conditions remain harsh, even life-threatening, with severe overcrowding being a huge issue. Eritrea has weak law-enforcement capacities, although penalties exist in the legal framework of the country. There is neither an independent police oversight body nor a specialized law-enforcement unit in the country, and corruption and bribery are common. Eritrea shares land borders with Ethiopia, Sudan and Djibouti, and encompasses 441 islands. The government holds firm control over the country\u2019s borders, including through enforcing a \u2018shoot to kill\u2019 policy for all those who attempt to gain an unauthorized entry into the country or try to flee it. Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence that it controls and profits from the smuggling of people as well as goods, including narcotics.","text - economic and financial environment":"Eritrea is reportedly at a high risk of money laundering primarily because of its cash-based, largely informal economy. Other vulnerabilities include the widespread use of informal money transfer systems, such as the hawala, the insufficient regulatory capacity and the growing corruption in the country. The state currency \u2212 the nakfa, is not fully convertible, which opens up certain vulnerabilities to the use of illicit financial services. Banks in the country are all under the control of the state and are not transparent. Specific references to money laundering are not apparent in Eritrean laws or proclamations available to the general public. State cooperation with the IMF and the World Bank is insufficient. Eritrea is considered extremely difficult with regards to ease of doing business, and the UN, the European Union and the United States have placed a 12-year arms embargo on Eritrea. For years, Eritrea\u2019s economy has been a prerogative of the PFDJ party and the military. The economy remains very weak and citizens experience shortages of fuel and drinking water as well as constant electricity blackouts.","text - civil society and social protection":"There is no evidence of government efforts to identify, protect or support victims of trafficking. There are no proactive victim identification mechanisms in place to recognize victims from at-risk groups, especially Eritrean citizens that have been deported from abroad or those who are fleeing the country. In addition, the government has yet to report the establishment of a standardized instrument for referring trafficking victims to proper care. Moreover, foreign victims have no alternatives to being deported to their home countries in the instances where they face punishment. Although Eritrea launched a series of awareness-raising events and poster campaigns to bring the attention of citizens to the dangers of human trafficking, national authorities have limited comprehension of the phenomenon. With regards to press freedom, Eritrea has a clear dictatorship where the media have no rights, and in 2019, 16 journalists were reported imprisoned in the country. Non-governmental organizations are not permitted to operate in Eritrea and independent media outlets were closed down in 2001. Additionally, authorities in the country have no regard for the freedom of assembly, and demonstrations in the recent past have been met with lethal force and arbitrary detentions.

Trafficking victims are also exploited in livestock rearing, crop farming and car washing. In the latter trades, victims from Mozambique, who may have voluntarily entered Eswatini, are also exploited. ##&& Unregulated labour brokering in Eswatini allows for a profitable illicit human smuggling market. The prevalence of poverty sees individuals seeking opportunities in South Africa, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation.","text - trade":"Eswatini has historically been a transit country for arms destined for neighbouring countries during conflicts in the 1980s and 1990s. This has become less prevalent, although it is believed that substantial numbers of leftover arms are still present. While unlicensed gun ownership is high, the total number of guns has reportedly gone down over the last decade. Eswatini has been less affected by small-arms and light-weapons proliferation largely because of its stability since independence. The few cases reported relate to cross-border smuggling of arms from neighbouring South Africa and Mozambique. Most armed crimes in Eswatini are robberies.","text - environment":"Poaching and other wildlife crime numbers are generally low in Eswatini, mainly due to small fauna populations, but low incomes have resulted in some actors resorting to poaching pangolins that are later traded through ports in South Africa. Although Eswatini has aimed to purge the trade, a lack of funding has often led to the arrest of low-income criminals while wealthy traffickers key to maintaining trafficking routes remain at large. Eswatini has previously been implicated as a transit zone in the smuggling of abalone from South Africa. As there are no trade regulations applicable to South African abalone in transit or in destination countries, illegally harvested abalone can be legally imported by market states. With regard to flora, no major crimes have been reported in Eswatini, although there are concerns about the unsustainable harvesting of plants and poaching of wildlife. Most plant and animal species typically used for medicinal purposes are becoming locally extinct or very rare due to high demand, with local markets having large stocks traded and exported into the region, far exceeding sustainable consumption levels. The unsustainable extraction of flora for charcoal production and for sale as firewood also leads to the illegal trade and export of indigenous flora. Although the illicit trade of cycads has been flagged, the volume of cycads traded illegally is low. ##&& Eswatini is a transit route for contraband raw minerals from South Africa, smuggled on trucks transporting legal commodities to Eswatini and Mozambique. Networks of illegal miners and international buyers smuggle illicitly mined gold from South Africa into Eswatini, where it is exported to jewellery manufacturing hubs in the Middle East and Southern Asia. Although the political elite is involved, volumes are relatively small.","text - drugs":"Eswatini is a major cultivator of cannabis, producing well-known high-quality cannabis sought after in foreign markets. Cannabis cultivation is driven by deteriorating economic conditions disproportionately affecting women and young people. Eswatini nationals have been arrested in neighbouring countries and further afield for transporting and selling the drug. Nigerian syndicates are also reportedly involved in the trade of Eswatini cannabis in South Africa, Europe and elsewhere. After cannabis, cocaine is the most widely used illicit drug, with most users consuming it in powder form. Crack cocaine is the second most popular. A small but growing number of users inject the drug. Customs, border patrol and other law enforcement bodies are involved in sustaining the cocaine trade, providing territorial security and physical protection for dealers, and facilitating imports. Cocaine trafficking occurs through the same channels as heroin, with South Africa being the primary destination. ##&& The domestic heroin market is small but growing, and the country provides important transit routes for heroin trafficked from Mozambique to South Africa and beyond. Insufficient border control and unofficial border crossings make it a low-risk route for traffickers, and trafficking occurs both overland and through the international airport. Regarding the synthetic-drug trade, Eswatini has a small but rapidly growing domestic methamphetamine market. There is no domestic synthetic-drug production, but a transit trade in chemical precursors remains, including the diversion of licit chemicals as well as domestic and transit trade in small amounts of other finished synthetic products such as methaqualone, methcathinone and MDMA. Mandrax tends to be the most common synthetic drug, but it is not present in large amounts.","text - criminal actors":"Most criminal activity in Eswatini is perpetrated by small gangs and syndicates engaged in various activities from armed robbery to hijacking and smuggling. Syndicates are particularly involved in vehicle, drug and human smuggling and trafficking through the country and, therefore, tend to have links with criminal organizations in neighbouring South Africa and Mozambique. Violent crime disproportionately affects the poor, and is most often perpetrated by persons operating in these criminal groups. The main organized criminal activities are facilitated by the corruption of political elites, law enforcement and regulatory authorities. High-level corruption is funded by revenue from the illicit trade of counterfeit goods, precious minerals, stolen motor vehicles, clothing and textiles, pharmaceuticals and livestock. At the operational level, officials mandated to manage borders are positioned to intercept or facilitate such crime, and police have been complicit in smuggling foodstuffs into Eswatini. The same is true of regulatory authorities that govern asset investment and fund transfers. The proceeds of organized crime are most frequently invested in the purchase of real estate or motor vehicles, and the setting up or funding of cash-intensive retail business. ##&& Most incidents involving foreign actors are transactional and include the transit of commodities, the retail of small amounts of contraband, or violent robberies. Nigerian syndicates are potentially active in the cannabis trade, and profitable foreign enterprises are also engaged in the wildlife trade and trade in harder drugs. There are also reports of South African criminals making regular trips to and through the country, suggesting some form of illicit activity, most likely money laundering. Despite allegations, there has been very little evidence of mafia-style groups in Eswatini since the late 1990s.","text - leadership and governance":"Eswatini is a monarchy in which the king has the power to dissolve Parliament and veto any decision, and governance structures are too outmoded to respond effectively to organized crime. King Mswati III is often supported by elites in efforts to repress the media and civil-society groups, and impunity is reinforced by reciprocal patronage illustrated by occasional leakages of grand corruption and criminality at high levels. Additionally, the government has regularly failed to pay vehicle costs and fuel bills, resulting in an under-resourced police service. ##&& Eswatini has ratified several international treaties pertaining to organized crime and corruption, but has few bilateral relations and embassies abroad, making international and regional cooperation difficult. The country also has a limited number of extradition agreements relating to fiscal matters, most notably with South Africa, and is a founder member of the Asset Recovery Inter-Agency Network of Southern Africa. Eswatini is also a member of the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group and a member of the Southern Africa Regional Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization. In practice, however, the government is generally not responsive to legal assistance requests pertaining to transnational crime. Eswatini has made progress since 2018 with the passing of a domestic law addressing human trafficking, and the tabling of a law regarding human smuggling. However, certain laws remain deficient and require amendment, with the legislative process described as slow and the legal regime as underdeveloped. Eswatini is generally praised for its strict conservation strategy, though its funding has been acknowledged to be a strain on the relatively poor country.","text - criminal justice and security":"Judicial independence and integrity are hindered by the absolute power of the King to appoint judges, demonstrated by the 2011 removal of a judge for allegedly criticizing him. Although the King is required to consult the judicial service commission, the latter is dominated by his appointees, and the suitability of recent appointments has been questioned. It has also been contended that the judiciary perceives \u2018contempt of court\u2019 so broadly that it renders the judiciary above criticism and unaccountable. Courts are reported to be ill-equipped due to the underdeveloped legal regime, and although cases involving human trafficking went to trial in 2018, no convictions were secured. No judiciary-related specialized units with the specific aim of countering organized crime exist, but notably, a relatively low proportion of Eswatini\u2019s prison population is in pre-trial detainment. ##&& While Eswatini does appear to have established two specialized law-enforcement units for combating organized crime, law enforcement is affected by a lack of training and funds. Police are slow in getting to crime scenes, and often have to walk, take public transport or hitch-hike. To combat cross-border crime, Eswatini has signed several memorandums of understanding with South Africa, Lesotho and Mozambique to facilitate greater collaboration, intelligence-sharing and technical assistance. However, police in the country have reportedly been involved in smuggling activities, thus exacerbating inefficient border control. Eswatini\u2019s border is shared with Mozambique and South Africa, and several informal unmonitored crossing points are used occasionally, especially during festive periods. The same crossing points are also useful for smuggling contraband.","text - economic and financial environment":"Although domestic law encompasses money laundering and terrorist financing and the establishment of a financial intelligence unit, it has not published annual reports or media releases. The country has committed its policies to EU guidelines and ratified multilateral conventions. As emphasized, Eswatini is a member of the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group. The country has made significant progress in addressing some crucial deficiencies assessed by the Financial Action Task Force in 2009, but nonetheless, legislative infrastructure has not yielded significant interceptions and prosecutions. A low degree of economic freedom for citizens has also been reported, accompanied by lavish government spending and mismanaged funds. Poor economic circumstances, government misspending and lack of prevention activities enable criminal activity, with many citizens having to rely on informal practices.","text - civil society and social protection":"Some efforts have been made to meet the needs of trafficking victims and to repatriate citizens through agreements with South Africa. Shelters are run by non-governmental organizations, but victims of domestic crime have limited support, with a rare one-stop centre in the capital city offering support to victims of gender-based violence. Eswatini has also reported human rights abuses, with marginalized groups, such as the LGBT community, unlikely to report crime. A 2018 law plugged some deficiencies pertaining to witness protection, and Eswatini has adopted an array of legislative and administrative instruments to prevent corruption and organized crime. However, the patronage at the centre of governance is a source of persistent fragility in crime and corruption prevention. The strategy needs to be informed by an assessment of the country\u2019s risks to money laundering and illicit financial flows, but although a risk assessment process was undertaken in 2019, its outcome has not been published. ##&& Mechanisms for non-state actor oversight are present, but weak. Journalists are regularly attacked by police, and prevented from working freely by the government and official state institutions, not least the country's judicial system. One the one hand, members of the government are exempted from all prosecution in the courts. Conversely, however, any those criticising the government are often subject to prosecution.

Most trafficked persons start their journey voluntarily and become vulnerable to abuses en route to the Middle East, Europe or North America. Meanwhile, internal trafficking occurs from rural to urban areas. The country has a relatively high awareness of the risk of labour exploitation, due to longstanding problems with trafficking related to labour migration and employment agencies. Many recruitment agencies for labour migration to the Gulf are unregistered or informal and effectively act as rackets to exploit workers. While the lifting of a ban on migration to Gulf countries in early 2018 may have increased trafficking of Ethiopian nationals to the region, an increasingly aggressive repatriation policy among Gulf countries \u2013 and particularly Saudi Arabia \u2013 since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic has likely had the opposite effect. ##&& Ethiopia is a country of departure and transit for irregular migration into other countries in Southern Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Smuggling occurs across borders to and\/or from all neighbouring countries, with smuggling networks often facilitating the flow of movements. Overland human smuggling channels from Ethiopia mostly make use of three routes \u2013 the eastern, western and southern. The eastern has Somalia and Djibouti as transit points for migrants looking to reach Yemen, the western moves through Sudan and the southern route goes through Kenya and into Southern Africa. Refugee camps in Tigray and Amhara are also recruitment grounds for organized smuggling networks. Additionally, border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea were briefly opened in 2018 and then closed again, renewing the demand for smuggling networks to assist Eritreans seeking to cross the borders. Because of Ethiopia not automatically granting asylum to people from Eritrea entering the country\u2019s territory since 2020, reliance on smuggling networks for Eritreans attempting to enter or transit through Ethiopia may have increased.","text - trade":"Ethiopia is both a source and transit route for arms trafficking, with weapons flowing freely to and from Ethiopia across the country's long and porous borders. Despite an improvement in relations in recent years, the prolonged border dispute with Eritrea and heavy military presence along the joint border still limits the illicit flow of weapons between the two countries. Meanwhile, the Ethiopian state has routinely violated the arms embargo imposed on Somalia by providing weapons to friendly regional and proxy forces. However, state-sponsored arms trafficking has likely reduced significantly since the strengthening of relations with Somalia. Additionally, the armed conflict in the Tigray region has led to an escalation in small arms and light weapons proliferation in the country as well. Allegedly, Turkey has become a major supplier of illicit arms that are trafficked into Ethiopia through Sudan and Djibouti. Beyond the Tigray and Amhara regions, a spillover of weapons is observed in other parts of the country, Addis Ababa most notably.","text - environment":"The flora crimes market in Ethiopia is more akin to an informal trade, in that the government is fully aware of its existence. Plant species are trafficked for the purpose of making local drinks but also for medicinal and fumigation purposes as well as for food. Certain plants are trafficked across the Ethio-Sudanese border. Additionally, there are reports that the movement of charcoal is cross-border, with consignments exchanged between Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia. As for fauna crimes, Ethiopia is a transit point in the Horn of Africa for ivory, rhino horn, skins and live animals. With Ethiopian Airlines serving the largest number of routes in Africa, Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa remains a hub for trafficked goods, including ivory and rhino horn trafficked between West Africa and Asia. As home to the largest population of donkeys in Africa, Ethiopia has also been affected by growing demand for ejiao, a product derived from the animals\u2019 hide and used in Chinese medicine. The growing commercialization of cross-border cattle rustling in Eastern Africa has also prompted the rise of criminal networks involved in the trade, including in Ethiopia. Ethiopia is also a source and transit route for smuggled non-renewable resources, particularly gold, with buyers in Ethiopia reportedly offering higher than international prices to artisanal producers to facilitate money laundering. Although gold exploitation in Ethiopia is minimal, reports suggest that gold is also smuggled from Sudan through Ethiopia to the UAE.","text - drugs":"Ethiopia is a transit and destination market for heroin. While domestic use is low, the supply of heroin in the country is growing. Heroin is imported primarily via air, with corrupt security officials allegedly facilitating trafficking. Heroin landing in Ethiopia is often in transit to West African markets, via networks of West African organized crime groups. Heroin also transits Ethiopia on its way to European and United States markets, coming from South-eastern and Western Asia. In regard to cocaine, Ethiopia is mainly a transit country for Andean cocaine destined for markets in Southern Africa, particularly South Africa. Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa is a particularly vulnerable trans-shipment point, receiving cocaine shipments from initial West African points of continental entry. While Ethiopia is primarily a transit country for cannabis trafficked between Central Asia and Western Europe, through neighbouring countries, the country is not a major source or destination market for the drug. There is little production of cannabis in the country, mainly concentrated in rural areas and around the town of Shashemene more specifically. Cannabis use has also reportedly increased over the course of 2020, as have seizures of cannabis in the country. As for synthetic drugs, Ethiopia is not a major production hub for synthetic drugs or precursor chemicals. Nevertheless, Mandrax emerged fairly recently as an issue in the region as chemical precursors and licit drugs are increasingly diverted into the illegal market.","text - criminal actors":"Criminal groups in Ethiopia are more akin to community security groups, rather than mafia-style groups, that are embedded in the security apparatus of the state. In contrast, national criminal networks are quite active in Ethiopia. These networks engage in illegal activities for economic reasons mainly. Human smuggling operations, for instance, extend from loosely linked opportunists and criminal entrepreneurs to well-organized syndicates that have an extensive reach over several states. The latter have an extensive structure with different individuals filling in various roles as part of the larger network. ##&& As a key transit hub for different organized crime activities, there are foreign criminal actors present in Ethiopia. With Ethiopian Airlines serving the largest number of routes in Africa, Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa remains a hub for goods trafficked from and\/or throughout the continent. Evidence suggests that drug and wildlife trafficking as well as human smuggling are mainly organized by transnational networks from other parts of Africa. East African drug traffickers are very active in Ethiopia, while West Africans and Chinese nationals lead the illicit fauna trade. In regard to state-embedded actors, anecdotal reports indicate increasing corruption, with the gradual process of economic liberalization in the country providing new opportunities for misappropriation. However, the current government initiated an anti-corruption purge in 2019.","text - leadership and governance":"Under the current government, Ethiopia has pursued an ambitious reform agenda, including multiple initiatives intended to counter organized crime. A case in point is the anti-human trafficking projects carried out in the Bole International Airport along with the training and capacity-building exercises designed to build up the capacity of police, immigration and customs officers to respond to and tackle organized crime. Nevertheless, civil unrest remains a significant threat to stability throughout the country. Surging ethnic nationalism in several regional states has also diminished the federal government\u2019s ability to effectively address organized crime. Corruption is also present in Ethiopia but is widely considered less of an issue than in countries throughout the region. While there is some indication of increasing corruption in Ethiopia, the current government has taken measures to combat corruption, including the conviction of multiple former government officials and executives of state-owned companies. ##&& On an international level, Ethiopia has ratified a number of relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. Furthermore, the country is an active member of regional international organizations and initiatives. Close cooperation on matters related to organized crime exists between Ethiopia and Djibouti. However, prolonged civil unrest has also dented the country\u2019s image as an island of stability in the Horn of Africa. On the domestic level, Ethiopia has a solid anti-organized crime legislative framework, although funding and implementation mechanisms are not yet in place. The country has a strong set of national laws regarding wildlife and, since 2019, new firearms legislation has been passed, introducing tougher provisions on illicit firearm use and trafficking. The country also passed new anti-human trafficking and smuggling legislation in early 2020 intended, in part, to strengthen efforts to investigate and prosecute traffickers. Additionally, the country\u2019s criminal code was recently revised to criminalize money laundering.","text - criminal justice and security":"Although Ethiopia\u2019s judiciary is officially independent, in practice, it has rarely deviated from government policy. The appointment of a new chief justice of the Supreme Court, however, has raised hopes for judicial reform. In the Ethiopian judicial system, there is a special bench on organized crime, with dedicated experts and special prosecutors. Prison conditions in the country are criticized and there are reports of human rights abuses, including torture. Nevertheless, there have been steps to reform the penal system since 2018 with authorities shifting focus to rehabilitation. Meanwhile, efforts have been made in the development of law enforcement capacity against organized crime, including the establishment of various authorities and departments in charge of dismantling organized crime networks. Ethiopia\u2019s police force faces notable challenges with regard to corruption and impunity. As for territorial integrity, there are a couple of factors that serve to increase Ethiopia\u2019s vulnerabilities, namely the fact that the country stands at the epicentre of a region plagued by instability and the extensive porous borders it shares with neighbouring countries. Moreover, surging ethnic nationalism and widespread unrest in several regional states has likely diminished the federal government\u2019s overall ability to patrol some border areas.","text - economic and financial environment":"While Ethiopia has legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating financial crimes, its anti-money laundering laws and regulations need further strengthening. Illicit proceeds in the country are reportedly generated primarily by tax evasion or fraud, human trafficking\/smuggling, the trafficking of arms and contraband smuggling as well as illicit financial services. While the country\u2019s financial services sector is still closed to foreign investors, with the country's economy opening up and expanding, Ethiopia will likely become more vulnerable to cybercrime, fraud and the related money-laundering activities. However, in 2019, in what potentially marks a significant step in liberalizing the financial sector in Ethiopia, a business license was granted to a US-based firm. Overall, there are clear gaps in terms of the effectiveness of Ethiopia\u2019s economic regulatory environment, but the government has reviewed existing policies to enhance economic regulation in the formal sector.","text - civil society and social protection":"In Ethiopia, there has been a lack of effort in addressing child sex trafficking and a lack of standard procedures for proactively identify victims of human trafficking. In 2018, Ethiopian authorities stepped up their victim-protection efforts by means of collaborating with civil society as well as with international organizations. Moreover, the new Prevention and Suppression of Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants Proclamation, passed in early 2020, includes a scheme to rescue, support and rehabilitate victims of trafficking. Ethiopia has also put efforts into raising awareness at the community level against organized crime and trafficking-related crimes. A new National Crime Prevention Strategy was approved in 2020 but is yet to be adopted. ##&& The current administration has taken a new approach to the regulation of civil society organizations, allowing foreign and foreign-funded organizations to engage in advocacy and human rights work in Ethiopia. Overall, however, civil society organizations remain weak. In terms of the media, the country has made progress in improving the freedom of the press, but laws that obstruct the work of journalists are still in place. Additionally, the restrictive regime guiding the use of and access to mobile applications and the internet, enforced in light of the 2015 protests in the country, was lifted. However, a new law targeting hate speech and disinformation was passed in 2020 and has been criticized for its potential to stifle public debate.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Addis Ababa","GDP (current $US million)":"95912.59","Income group":"Low income","Population":"112078730","Land Area (sq. km)":"1136259","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"99","Freedom in the World Index":"22","Human Development Index":"0.49","Global Peace Index":"2.53","Democracy Index":"3.38","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"38","GDP per capita (current US$)":"856","1":"4.79","1.1":"4.95","1.2":"4.63","2":"5.38"},{"Corresp":"62","ISO-3":"GAB","Country":"Gabon","ISO-2":"GA","Continent":"Africa","Region":"Central Africa","Flag file":"ga.png","1.

Shopkeepers also exploit Gabonese children in markets in the eastern provinces. Many are brought in by traffickers who have been reported to procure falsified documents identifying their child victims to be over the age of 18. Additionally, women from West Africa are used in domestic servitude and as prostitutes. There are also reports of brothel owners sexually exploiting children. ##&& Gabon serves as the final stop for migrants from West and Central Africa seeking to access the labor market, though human smuggling itself is not a very significant problem in the country. There are overlaps between human trafficking and human smuggling, whereby smugglers assist individuals in entering the country with fake documents by air or by boat, before subjecting them to forced labour and sexual exploitation.","text - trade":"Overall, Gabon is not a high-risk arms trafficking market. However, recent instability in the country has led to arms brokers seeking to sell weapons. Gabon is at risk given its proximity to Cameroon, although the southern border of Cameroon is not particularly prone to arms trafficking.","text - environment":"In Gabon, forest crimes are widespread and closely linked to the inner workings of the industrial logging industry. It has been reported that the majority of companies operating in the industrial logging sector in Gabon routinely bribe ministers in order to get timber concessions and avoid punishment for their continuous breaking of forest laws and the diversion of millions in unpaid taxes. Gabon is one of the top timber-exporting countries to China, which suggests a considerable volume of rosewood being illegally traded. Though most evidence is anecdotal, there may be potential convergence between timber and minerals (gold) trafficking by Cameroonian military officials. In Gabon, wildlife crimes are also problematic, particularly the poaching of forest elephant in areas such as Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 National Park. The illegal trade in other species, including great apes, is also an issue in the country with poachers often coming from neighboring Cameroon and Congo. Corruption facilitates poaching and wildlife trafficking. In regard to non-renewable resource crimes, while gold-producing countries surround Gabon, there is no evidence to suggest that the latter serves as a transit or destination point. There is, however, some indication of gold originating in Gabon being exported illegally, primarily towards The Republic of the Congo.","text - drugs":"Cannabis is the most commonly used drug in Gabon and is brought into the country primarily from Cameroon. Meanwhile, Gabon is an intra-continental trans-shipment point for cocaine that generally enters the continent through other West African and Central African entry points. It is repackaged and shipped through sea routes, as well as air routes that include Gabon, before making its way to destination markets in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Trans-shipment of heroin is likely, given that the transit of cocaine exists. However, heroin use is limited in Gabon. Gabon is primarily a destination country for synthetic drugs. As in other Central African countries, there are reports of widespread use of tramadol.","text - criminal actors":"Regular arrests of wildlife traffickers and seizures of ivory by Gabonese authorities suggest that criminal networks are active in the country with cross-border operations across parts of Central and West Africa. There are also reports of foreign actors from Asia being involved in forest crimes. In terms of human trafficking, operations in the country involve loose, ethnically based criminal networks that recruit victims across West and Central Africa. These span multiple nationalities, which vary with the stage of the trafficking process. ##&& State-embedded actors play a role in facilitating a range of crime types. In the case of forest crimes, systematic corruption and routine bribery involving multiple layers of public servants and decision-makers, including ministers, allow logging companies to engage in forestry crime while avoiding punishment. In relation to human trafficking, there is widespread complicity in trafficking crimes, including judicial staff, with judges allegedly taking bribes from traffickers to delay or dismiss trafficking cases. Meanwhile, there is no evidence of mafia-style groups operating in Gabon.","text - leadership and governance":"Gabon experienced a political crisis after the 2016 election, which resulted in a failed coup attempt and growing mistrust in the government. The latter is mostly considered corrupt. Moreover, there is growing public dissatisfaction over controversial constitutional amendments and the highly unequal distribution of natural resource wealth, which among other issues has contributed to the overall instability in the country. Gabon currently does not have any legislation on open contracting or access to information. ##&& On the international level, Gabon has ratified many relevant international treaties pertaining to organized crime. The country has entered into bilateral engagements to address forest and wildlife crimes. Gabon also signed bilateral cooperation agreements with Togo and Benin, with the aim of strengthening law enforcement coordination against international trafficking networks. On the domestic level, Gabon generally adopts relevant laws with respect to combatting organized crime but is weak with compliance and implementation.","text - criminal justice and security":"There are no specialized judiciary units with the specific aim of countering organized crime in Gabon. In general, because of the country\u2019s governance and leadership framework, the judiciary is not trusted and is seen as a tool for the ruling party and the elite. There have been reports of complicity among judicial staff, with judges allegedly taking bribes from traffickers to delay or dismiss cases. In addition, limited professional capacity often results in prosecutorial judges not always investigating cases of human trafficking brought to their attention. Similarly, Gabon lacks specialized law enforcement units tasked with countering organized crime. ##&& As far as territorial integrity is concerned, there is statutory free movement of persons and goods between Gabon and its three neighboring countries under the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa free movement regulations. However, the country has often closed its borders in times of trouble, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has also closed its borders with Cameroon to curb alleged illegal immigration. The border with Cameroon, while well policed, is also highly vulnerable to corruption by custom officers on both sides. Furthermore, Gabon\u2019s unguarded beaches and porous borders in some locations allow traffickers to move people and commodities by car or boat.","text - economic and financial environment":"Gabon\u2019s economic environment is not conducive to setting up and operating a legitimate business. Moreover, ongoing perceptions of weak governance and high levels of corruption continue to deter private sector investment and constrain economic growth. Meanwhile, money laundering is a criminal offence in Gabon, as in other countries in Central Africa, however, there have not been any money laundering cases prosecuted. Gabon shares the same anti-money laundering strategy under the Central Africa Monetary Union. At the national level, Gabon\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit investigates instances of money laundering and corruption and cooperates with its counterparts in the region. Although being operational, the unit is not properly staffed, which limits its effectiveness. In addition, the prosecution of money-laundering cases in Gabon is not effective because of certain shortcomings of its legal system.","text - civil society and social protection":"Gabon has few mechanisms to help victims exit modern slavery. With respect to human trafficking, there are two state-funded NGO shelters offering medical, legal, housing and other services to homeless and orphaned children who are most at risk of trafficking. For those wishing to report corruption as witnesses, there are strong concerns about retaliation. Meanwhile, Gabon has taken some preventive measures for certain criminal activities, including GPS real-time tracking collars to deter ivory trafficking and eco-guards patrolling the country\u2019s national parks. Since 2018, authorities have strengthened their efforts to better prevent human trafficking. Also, in 2019, the government partnered with NGOs to organize a campaign to raise awareness against human trafficking as well as other forms of violence against children.

Women and girls are at the highest risk of becoming a victim of sex trafficking in The Gambia; however, boys are also vulnerable, being subjected to sexual exploitation or forced labour in domestic servitude or as street vendors. In many cases, the sexual exploitation of children involves child sex tourists who rely on European and Gambian travel agencies to facilitate their offending. Moreover, sex traffickers increasingly host child sex tourists in private residences outside the commercial tourist areas. Sierra Leonean children have also been exploited in The Gambia as \u2018cultural dancers'. Women may also be trafficked abroad, often to the Middle East, where they are forced into the sex trade or labour. ##&& The Gambia is mainly a source country for human smuggling. Since the civil war in Libya in 2011, tens of thousands of young Gambians have attempted to cross the Mediterranean to Europe among other irregular routes.

Nevertheless, laws on the use and possession of dangerous weapons are strict and penalties are high, with military-style firearms being illegal in the country.","text - environment":"In Gambia, illegal logging and timber trafficking remain the most pervasive criminal market with connections to neighbouring Senegal and Guinea Bissau. Although the current government has shown considerable political will to reduce trafficking in illicit timber and to cooperate with Senegal in this fight, cross-border illegal logging and smuggling of timber continue. In that respect, the southern border of the country hosts the trafficking routes that see flora trafficked through The Gambia to Asian markets. In regard to fauna crimes, due to illegal wildlife trafficking, chimpanzees are now extinct in The Gambia. Furthermore, hippopotamus, African elephants, lions, leopards, sperm whales, Atlantic humpbacked dolphins and the African manatee have been listed as vulnerable and endangered. Additionally, foreign actors have been reportedly involved in illegal fishing in Gambian waters. There is very little, if any, gold mining in The Gambia. However, for the last several years, there has been much public unrest due to the illegal sand mining, which has had a severe environmental impact. Overall, however, the non-renewable resource crimes market is not pervasive.","text - drugs":"Historically, poor coastal and border controls, in addition to corrupt service members, made The Gambia an ideal transit destination for most drugs. Cannabis is the most problematic drug in The Gambia and is the cause of most drug-related crimes committed in the country. The cannabis trade appears most pervasive in The Gambia and as such, it is reportedly driving most drug-related offences in the country. Cannabis is also the most commonly seized drug in The Gambia. It mainly originates from the Casamance region in Senegal. The Gambia is a waypoint for heroin on its way to European markets. The amount of the drug that transits the country is growing at such pace that national authorities have now deemed the heroin trade a national security threat. ##&& The Gambia is also a major transit hub for cocaine trafficked from South America to European markets. Tonnes of cocaine moving via maritime shipments and airports have been seized in the country. Moreover, the domestic cocaine market is also on the rise, partly driven by the growing tourism sector. In regard to synthetic drugs, there is some evidence that methamphetamine is produced in The Gambia. Domestic use is thought to be common, especially among tourists. The abuse of drugs such as diazepam and clonazepam is gradually increasing among the youth. Moreover, The Gambia is used as a transit country for methamphetamine from Nigeria. Benzodiazepines are also common in the country.","text - criminal actors":"Criminal networks are a prevalent criminal actor type in The Gambia. Despite the country\u2019s political transition, organized crime is still considered a threat to development, rule of law and national security. Furthermore, close to the border region between Senegal and The Gambia, separatist violence and armed banditry occurs due to the ongoing conflict in the Senegalese Casamance region. Although separatist fighters primarily target the military, civilians travelling or living in the region have also suffered attacks by both militants and criminal elements. In terms of foreign actors, there is a high presence of Chinese firms in The Gambia that have allegedly engaged in polluting the environment while producing materials ready for export to China. Even though these activities do not constitute organized crime per se, the possibility of organized crime links does exist. The illicit distribution of psychotropic drugs is also associated with foreign actors and the tourism industry. ##&& Police officers are perceived as the most corrupt officials in the country, along with business executives. Although corruption and extortion by public officers are punishable under Gambian criminal code, in reality, state authorities have often been involved in corruption with no repercussion. The change of leadership has stemmed this condition. However, previous rulers have not yet been brought to justice. Currently no mafia-style groups have been identified in The Gambia.","text - leadership and governance":"Despite the change of leadership, there is no evidence of any proactive measures to counter the rise in organized criminal activities. Meanwhile, The Gambia\u2019s corruption is less of an issue compared to other African countries. However, there is clearly scope for significant improvement in anti-corruption efforts, especially in light of lingering doubts about the government\u2019s commitment to tackle corrupt practices. ##&& On the international level, The Gambia has ratified the majority of relevant international treaties pertaining to organized crime. However, there are no reports of any significant collaboration with international agencies to build capacity against organized crime, except for the signing of an anti-drug memorandum of understanding with Senegal. On the domestic level, The Gambia has a number of laws related to organized crimes, including such that deem forms of organized crime a \u2018serious offence\u2019 or criminalize organized crime groups. Under the current administration, there is an improved policy-making environment and many relevant institutions exist to counter organized crime. The current government is also more politically sensitive to the need of legal and policy frameworks dedicated to countering organized crime.","text - criminal justice and security":"The Gambia does not have any judicial units set up with the specific aim of fighting organized crime. However, the country has a functional judiciary, which has a history of sourcing judges from other African countries, especially Nigeria, to enhance its effectiveness. The government has also made efforts to professionalize the judiciary and recruit more Gambians so the judiciary can be considered more independent. In regard to law enforcement, there have been ongoing efforts under the current administration to diminish corruption that undermines law enforcement agencies' effectiveness, including removing the exercise of arbitrary detention and arrest. Given the small size of the country, with far shorter land and sea boundaries compared to some other countries in Africa, The Gambia\u2019s borders are much easier to control.

The ongoing efforts pertaining to improved legal environment, enhanced anti-corruption measures and improvement in political freedoms are strengthening the economic regulatory capacity of the country. Meanwhile, The Gambia has also made clear efforts to tackle money laundering and financial crime. Under the present government, there has been a push to establish a financial intelligence unit and cooperate with the Financial Action Task Force in conducting reviews. However, the need to strengthen enforcement capacity remains.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Gambia lacks any formal programme of victim or witness protection, despite its problem of human smuggling. However, there has been an international effort to introduce a project aimed at providing assistance to high officials and front-line enforcement officers to fight organized crime in The Gambia. A training session was also held in The Gambia to improve law enforcement\u2019s capacity to better respond and tackle drug trafficking as well as other related forms of transnational organized crime. As for press freedom, The Gambia is at a critical juncture. Since the change in political power, there has been greater space for civil-society organizations, including the media, to participate in the political life of the country.

While child trafficking is prevalent in the country\u2019s fishing, agricultural and mining industries, girls are also lured by traffickers with the promise of better economic opportunities and subsequently subjected to sexual exploitation or forced labour as porters. Ghanaian adults often fall victim to human trafficking through overseas recruitment agencies. A wave of labour migration of Ghanaian women to the Middle East facilitated by both licensed and unlicensed labour recruitment agencies was revealed to have links to forced labour, sexual exploitation and significant levels of physical abuse. ##&& In recent decades, Ghanaian smugglers have played a pivotal role in the development of West Africa\u2019s human smuggling industry. Human smugglers are well integrated into Ghanaian society and are perceived as facilitators of movement rather than criminals. This is the result of high mobility levels across West Africa due to the Economic Community of West African States\u2019 (ECOWAS) free movement treaty. As one of the more stable and economically attractive countries in the region, Ghana serves as a significant transit and destination country. Once in Ghana, many individuals are then smuggled beyond the ECOWAS zone, primarily to Europe and the Middle East. Ghana is also a known regional hub for the production of fake travel documents and American and European visas. Ghana\u2019s human smuggling market is largely driven by those seeking transportation to the US or Europe, although this has been on the decline in recent years.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking is a widespread and growing phenomenon in Ghana. Local illicit arms manufacturing is increasing in both prevalence and sophistication. Land-based arms trafficking is predominant along Ghana\u2019s northern and eastern borders, as well as in the Ashanti region. Illicit arms manufacturers, middlemen and local communities alike perceive small arms as an integral part of Ghanaian society, as arms have been used historically for cultural, economic and entertainment purposes. Many in the country have expressed discontent that stronger restrictions have forced traditional activities involving small arms underground and, thereby, have fostered the growth of international arms trafficking operations.","text - environment":"Ghana is a major supplier of illicit rosewood trafficked to Asia. The number of criminal networks involved in illicit logging is allegedly on the rise, and an alleged collusion between Ghanaian and Chinese criminal loggers exists. Rampant corruption in Ghana also facilitates illicit logging and timber trafficking. Notably, business elites are known to tap into criminal networks for profiteering purposes by supplying guns or other services. Moreover, a nexus exists between illicit timber logging and opaque cocoa and mineral mining operations in Ghana. Alongside the illicit flora market, a fauna one exists in Ghana as well. The country is a transit point for the illicit pangolin trade, as well as illicit trade in other rare species found in both Mole National Park and Kakum National Park. Elephant poaching is known to occur, although locals believe that its prevalence has decreased in tandem with the decline of Ghana\u2019s elephant population. As such, some poachers have allegedly shifted their focus to large-bodied birds such as hornbills. Poachers also target the African grey parrot. Additionally, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has heavily impacted Ghana\u2019s marine fish stocks. ##&& Ghana is one of the most significant source countries for illicit gold on the African continent with gold exports far exceeding official production. As such, Ghana is a major supplier of semi-pure gold to refineries in both India and the UAE. Paperwork related to gold imports is largely forged. Ghana also serves as a transit country for the laundering of stolen oil.","text - drugs":"Ghanaian drug trafficking groups have played a significant role in the massive expansion of the global drug trade, as well as in the expansion of illicit drug markets across the West African region. The country is both a transit point and a destination market for heroin coming primarily from Afghanistan. Corrupt officials play a significant role in the facilitation of heroin trafficking through Ghanaian seaports and airports. Ghana\u2019s domestic heroin market is believed to have expanded throughout the country. In regard to cocaine, Ghana is among the most important African transit countries for cocaine trafficked globally and across Africa. ##&& Meanwhile, the country is one of the largest cannabis cultivation hotspots in Africa. As cannabis is perceived as an 'indigenous' drug, it is seen as less harmful in communities and is primarily used by younger people. Ghana legalized the use of cannabis for health and industrial purposes in March 2020 and is reportedly considering the decriminalisation of all drugs, which would include cannabis cultivation, production, possession and use. The synthetic drug market in Ghana is rapidly growing. Tramadol abuse has been a significant issue since 2016, with the drug being largely imported from India. Tramadol use has also been linked to rising levels of violence in Ghana. Other synthetic drugs such as Fentanyl are also slowly appearing in the country. Moreover, a large number of precursor chemicals are believed to be diverted towards criminal networks in Ghana.","text - criminal actors":"State-embedded actors in several of Ghana\u2019s security and intelligence services play a key role in the facilitation of organized criminal activities. State-embedded corruption is also believed to significantly affect legislative capacity and processes. While Ghanaian officials have historically turned a blind eye to organized criminal activities, the infiltration of drug money into the public sphere has reportedly triggered a hardening of this approach. Informal Ghanaian criminal networks are known to be involved in drug, arms and human trafficking as well as in human smuggling, internet crimes and vehicle theft. Many criminal networks in Ghana are linked to African criminal networks. Informal networks of smugglers, particularly in the Brong Ahafo region, also have links to criminal groups in Burkina Faso and beyond. Criminal networks in Accra have known links to Nigerian criminal groups. Overall, criminal networks affect everyday life in Ghana and significantly undermine public institutions. Many of these groups are bound together by ethnic, religious, blood or other ties. Their criminal activity is not only facilitated by corruption, but also exacerbated by Ghana\u2019s low state capacity to counter organized crime. ##&& Chinese criminal actors in particular are known to have taken advantage of state-embedded connections to circumvent the requirement for fishing, logging, mining and other certifications in Ghana. Foreign criminal actors from other parts of Africa are also active in Ghana, especially on the country's illicit gold mining, drug trafficking and illicit logging markets. Meanwhile, although South American cartels have significant links to Ghanaian criminal networks, they do not physically operate in the country. There is little evidence of mafia-style groups in the country. However, some studies point to both hierarchical and non-hierarchical forms of mafia-style groups existing in Ghana.","text - leadership and governance":"The Ghanaian government has been somewhat vocal regarding the need to tackle organized crime. Nevertheless, political will to do so is lacking, evident in the emasculation of the Office of the Special Prosecutor and the Auditor-General. Regardless, Ghana is one of the most progressive and democratic countries in Africa and is a relatively stable country. Nevertheless, while several anti-corruption bodies exist in Ghana, concerns regarding their independence and lack of resources call their efficacy into question. Furthermore, since 2017 public approval for government efforts to fight corruption has decreased sharply. ##&& On the international level, Ghana is party to a number of relevant international treaties related to organized crime, although implementation remains a challenge. Ghana is active in a number of regional initiatives focused on combatting transnational organized crime, and works closely with a number of international organisations, including Western nations. Ghana receives significant aid in its efforts to prevent organized crime, and is the focus of several international law enforcement initiatives. The country\u2019s main challenge lies in intra-regional cooperation, implementation and communication. On the domestic level, Ghana has laws pertaining to organized crime, and the country benefits from a relatively robust rule of law in the African context. Despite legislation being in place, powers are often split across different bills, rendering the prosecution of organized crime difficult. ","text - criminal justice and security":"Ghana\u2019s judiciary lacks specialized units tasked with countering organized crime and the judiciary has been historically perceived as an extremely corrupt institution. Low levels of pay in the judiciary are believed to render rent-seeking opportunities commonplace. Bribery in civil courts is reportedly common. Consequently, fewer than half of Ghanaians trust the court system. Such perceptions of judicial corruption have in some instances led to the attempted implementation of mob justice. In terms of law enforcement, Ghana\u2019s capacity against organized crime remains limited. Corruption runs rampant across all levels of the police infrastructure as well. At the same time, reporting on corruption remains rare and impunity is rampant. The porosity of Ghana\u2019s land borders and high levels of corruption among border officials enable various illicit cross-border activities to flourish. Additionally, Ghanaian seaports are poorly patrolled and are believed to be transit hubs for human and drug trafficking. Nevertheless, efforts to enhance border patrol capacity are ongoing.","text - economic and financial environment":"Ghana has a strong formal banking system, although a significant proportion of the population lacks access to a bank account and is thus reliant on informal service providers. While the government seeks to promote private sector development, corruption runs rampant and a significant informal economy continues to pose barriers. Meanwhile, Ghana has one of the best Financial Action Task Force assessments in Africa. Ghana also has a highly developed banking sector, equipped with Know Your Client checks and other measures, and the country\u2019s Revenue Authority is involved in several international initiatives to enhance regulatory capacity. Ghana\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit is also reportedly operational and heavily engages with international organizations, and a significant level of aid flows to anti-corruption institutions. Nevertheless, gaps in law enforcement remain and money laundering is believed to pose a significant threat. Moreover, the influence of drug actors in Ghana\u2019s political system triggers delays in anti-money laundering legislation and initiatives.","text - civil society and social protection":"Ghana's victim and witness support capacity is limited. However, victim and witness support programmes have been implemented in the Kumasi and Ankaful prisons. Meanwhile, support for drug users is scarce, and only four state-funded facilities providing drug rehabilitation and treatment exist. Instead, support for drug users usually stems from NGOs, personal networks or families. Ghana is currently collaborating with international organisations to implement programmes aimed at combatting organized crime. The country also has a number of national policies that address specific types of organized crime. Nevertheless, the implementation of preventative policies and plans remains limited, and a lack of resources has restricted the operational capacity of new government agencies. ##&& Overall, Ghana\u2019s civil society sector is relatively active, and despite government criticism and attacks, addresses a wide range of issues and continues to expand. Civil society activism mainly occurs through electronic and print media, with radio media in particular playing a key role in criticizing government measures. However, an estimated one third of Ghana\u2019s media is either state-owned or owned by business people linked to the government. As such, print media in particular is known to often align with government interests.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Accra","GDP (current $US million)":"66983.63","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"30417856","Land Area (sq. km)":"238540","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"63.9","Freedom in the World Index":"82","Human Development Index":"0.61","Global Peace Index":"1.78","Democracy Index":"6.50","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"43","GDP per capita (current US$)":"2202","1":"6.02","1.1":"6.15","1.2":"5.88","2":"5.38"},{"Corresp":"70","ISO-3":"GIN","Country":"Guinea","ISO-2":"GN","Continent":"Africa","Region":"West Africa","Flag file":"gn.png","1.

Women and children remain at the highest risk of exploitation, and parents reportedly voluntarily send their daughters to intermediaries who then subject them to domestic work and sexual exploitation. The most popular end destinations for the Guinean victims of trafficking include the Middle East, Europe, the US as well as other countries in the West African region. Boys are also vulnerable to trafficking, mostly forced to beg, shine shoes, sell on the streets or work in diamond and gold mines, as well as in fishing, herding and plantations. Traffickers often take children from their parents by misleading guardians that their children will receive proper education, and then subject them to forced labour or begging in neighbouring states, such as C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Notably, the prevalence of the human trafficking market in Guinea is expected to spread further due to the economic restraints created by the COVID-19 pandemic. ##&& A number of factors, including the porous borders, underdeveloped infrastructure, widespread poverty and the subsequent social issues, have become a prerequisite for Guinea to become a country of origin as well as a transit hub for human smuggling. However, the smuggling market is relatively undeveloped domestically. Research shows that smugglers from North African countries recruit unemployed youth from the region to serve as migrant recruiters in their local communities. Intermediaries often provide false documents to allow migrants to cross borders, since the country lacks a fully operational and digitalized civil registry service. There have also been cases of false warrants for arrest used by smuggled persons in Europe to motivate their request for asylum on grounds of persecution or discrimination.","text - trade":"Given its political conflicts, instability, adverse socio-economic conditions and poor governance, arms trafficking within and into Guinea is a challenge. The entire region is characterized by a lack of transparency and control of weapons, which leads to arms ending up in the possession of criminal groups. The proliferation of arms within the country is boosted by local artisanal production of arms. Manufacturing is mostly driven by local demand and Guinean hunters are the primary clients. One of the main sources of small arms and light weapons in Guinea is the recent conflicts in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Sierra Leone and Liberia.","text - environment":"Given the significant rosewood trafficking in neighbouring Guinea-Bissau and the fact that forests in Guinea and Guinea-Bissau are part of the same ecosystem, it is possible that traffickers operating in Guinea-Bissau are functioning in Guinea as well. Illegal logging, however, is underreported in Guinea. In contrast, several types of illegal wildlife activities are occurring in Guinea. Historically, Guinea had an extensive illegal trade of CITES-regulated animal products\/species, including birds, parrots, seahorses and great apes, until sanctions were imposed in 2013. Guinea is both a country of origin and a destination market for illicit gold trafficking. The market provides livelihood to many actors and local elites are reportedly involved. Guinea's challenges in the gold and diamond sector relate to porous borders, the lack of formalization of artisanal mining and corruption. Guinea is a participant in the Kimberley Process, although it is reported that only a small fraction of the diamonds mined in the country goes through the process.","text - drugs":"Guinea sits along a major cocaine trafficking route from Latin America to Europe. Traffickers displaced from Guinea-Bissau after a 2013 sting operation were reported to have moved their operations to Guinea, benefitting from high-level protections of the state. As cocaine flows through this region have been increasing in the past two years, there is considerable reason to suggest that Guinea still plays a strategic role in the transhipment of cocaine. Meanwhile, Guinea is a transit country for cannabis, and there is reportedly cross-border trade with Guinea-Bissau. The scale of trafficking however is not very significant and there has been no record of major seizures recently. There is moderate trafficking of synthetic drugs in Guinea, though there is some evidence of production laboratories in the country, including several linked to the highest levels of government. Like other countries in West Africa, there is also considerable prescription drug abuse, including synthetic opioids such as tramadol. Guinea is a relatively minor transit country of heroin.","text - criminal actors":"African nationals are present in criminal organizations involved in human trafficking across Guinea. Latin American drug trafficking organizations have also developed close ties with politically connected facilitators in Guinea, allowing the country to assume a key role in the West African drug trade, though they are rarely visibly present in the country. Importantly, Asian criminal groups are present in the mining sector in Guinea. As mentioned, drug trafficking in the country has been known to penetrate various state institutions in a complex and profitable alliance. This has included direct involvement of public officials, especially elected officials, and people from the opposition in drug trafficking and the illicit mining market. ##&& There have been reports of vast human trafficking networks between Guinea, Senegal and Sierra Leone. These networks use the Conakry airport to transport victims for exploitative purposes to the Middle East. Such loose networks are often comprised of members of various nationalities. Meanwhile, there is limited evidence to support the existence of mafia-style groups in Guinea.","text - leadership and governance":"There is no evidence to suggest that government officials in Guinea have placed organized crime high on their agenda. The current administration, however, has taken action to move the country towards authoritarianism, evident in the replacement of the head of the Independent National Electoral Commission and the removal of the head of the Constitutional Court, as well as in shutting down media outlets and the arrests of opposition leaders. At the same time, persistent corruption and fiscal mismanagement remain significant issues in the country. Officials who use their status to gain a financial benefit are able to do so with impunity. Overall, the country is highly fragile and vulnerable to political conflict. ##&& On the international level, Guinea is party to a number of relevant international treaties pertaining to organized crime. Guinea is also part of a regional initiative aimed at countering drug trafficking and transnational organized crime in the region. On the domestic level, Guinea does not have an abundance of laws pertaining to organized crime. However, its current penal code includes the criminalization of human trafficking and debt bondage. Nevertheless, the minimum penalties for these crimes have been reduced and enforcement has been weak. Legislation on drugs, however, has remained unchanged, possibly because of the influence drug traffickers hold over state institutions in the country.","text - criminal justice and security":"There are no specialized units in the judiciary established with the specific aim of countering organized crime in Guinea. While the constitution provides for an independent judiciary, decisions are reportedly often influenced by political pressure or bribes. Besides corruption, the judicial system also suffers lack of transparency and understaffing. At the same time, Guinea has a significantly high number of people in pre-trial\/remand imprisonment, which demonstrates a deficiency in the legislative apparatus in processing court cases. Furthermore, detention centres and prisons in the country do not meet international standards. Similarly, law enforcement agencies are considered weak and corrupt. Police and gendarmes tend to ignore legal procedures and allegedly engage in the extortion of citizens. Corruption also creates a major constraint for effective border policing, which negatively impacts the country's territorial integrity.","text - economic and financial environment":"Despite being open to global trade, Guinea's economic climate does not fare well because of heavy investment regime, lack of regulator capacity and corruption. Moreover, constrained access to finance, underdeveloped facilitation of trade and logistics as well as inflation and poor education of the workforce put other obstacles in front of economic development. Meanwhile, poor law enforcement coupled with the country's largely cash-based economy allow increased vulnerability to money laundering. Though provided for by law, the country's financial intelligence unit has yet to become operational. Nevertheless, there is a mechanism in place which sees suspicious transaction reports sent to and processed in Guinea's central bank.","text - civil society and social protection":"Guinean authorities do not put the necessary efforts to adequately identify and protect human trafficking victims.

There have been prevention campaigns aimed at communities along the country's borders with Senegal and Sierra Leone, however, on-the-ground coordination is lacking as are trained professionals outside of the capital, which impedes progress. Additionally, civil-society in Guinea must seek the support of foreign donors on local leaders, which introduces the risk of political co-optation.

Corruption is also pervasive in the market and often reaches the high echelons of power. Moreover, links between illegal logging activities and the government have been established. Meanwhile, few accounts of wildlife trafficking other than marine wildlife have been identified in Guinea-Bissau. Industrial and small-scale fleets along with illegal foreign fleets operate in Bissau-Guinean territorial waters, barely reporting catch. Regarding terrestrial wildlife, the country\u2019s chimpanzees are threatened by poaching for bushmeat, traditional medicine and, in the case of infant chimps, by exploitation in the illegal pet trade.

While much has changed since the end of the transition to democratic rule, marked by the 2005 Presidential elections, there remains in place a significant infrastructure that still supports the trans-shipment of narcotics to other West and North African points of transit to European and North American markets. While heroin is smuggled through the country, there is sparse evidence that it has the corruptive impact of cocaine. Cocaine is also reportedly trafficking through the country in much larger quantities as Guinea-Bissau is a core component of the Andean Maritime Highway, which connects South American cocaine producers to European and North American markets, as well as providing an African link to markets in the Middle East and Asia. Cocaine trafficking involving Guinea-Bissau peaked in 2009 and receded in the following years, but is on the rise again. Corruption related to cocaine trafficking reaches the highest levels of government. ##&& As for cannabis, it is the most commonly used and demanded drug by the youth in the country. Guinea-Bissau is a transit country for cannabis, particularly marijuana, produced in neighbouring countries and bound for destination markets in Europe. Small quantities of cannabis are produced in Guinea-Bissau as well, reportedly along the border with Senegal. Meanwhile, there are some sporadic reports of synthetic drug trafficking in Guinea-Bissau. However, they do not appear to suggest a major route or significant levels of consumption of synthetic drugs in the country.","text - criminal actors":"Government officials in the country are described as highly corrupt and linked to both foreign and local organized criminal networks involved in illicit logging, drug and wildlife trafficking. It is believed that organized criminal networks involved in drug trafficking have infiltrated all levels of the state apparatus. Something more, available information suggests that businesspeople along with politicians and high-ranking military officers have sought funds from transnational criminal organizations to support their patronage networks. This has allowed drug traffickers from abroad to make use of Guinea-Bissau\u2019s military facilities and set up operations throughout uninhabited islands, parts of the Bijag\u00f3s Archipelago. There is also strong evidence of criminal networks involved in the cocaine trade throughout the country. These networks are relatively loose and reliant on external connections with criminal entrepreneurs. ##&& Foreign actors are also quite prevalent in the criminal landscape in Guinea-Bissau, especially in the illegal cocaine trade. Historically, Latin American groups have played an important role in the trade but their influence appears to have declined. In contrast, the influence of West African crime groups is on the rise in recent years. In addition, Islamist militias have tried to enter the local drug market and use the proceeds from the cocaine trade to fund their cause and operations, while Chinese citizens and companies appear to be actively involved in illegal logging. The mafia-style group typology of actors in Guinea-Bissau is political-style groups that operate mainly on the Senegalese border. The latter are territorial in nature and engage mostly in illicit logging. Recently, these groups have had their sources of financing blocked, which could result in new tensions at land borders.","text - leadership and governance":"There are no current plans to promote an anti-organized crime platform in Guinea-Bissau in the future. Moreover, the system instability that characterizes the country and the inability of the government to function adequately have prevented the adequate progress in the fight against organized crime. There are also major problems related to corruption, transparency and the complete absence of accountability. As a result, evidence suggests that cocaine trafficking has penetrated the entire political system. ##&& On the international level, Guinea-Bissau has ratified most international treaties pertaining to organized crime, as well as the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the African Union Convention on Corruption. In 2018, the government commenced joint operations against transnational organized crime in partnership with various international agencies. However, there is a general impression that the country does not engage well in international cooperation and would not hand over major organized crime suspects to partner states. In spite of that, a number of countries have provided assistance to Guinea-Bissau and maintain bilateral cooperation mechanisms on security issues. On a domestic level, Guinea-Bissau has a number of laws pertaining to organized crime that meet the UNTOC specifications. Despite the fact that Guinea-Bissau has an approved National Strategic Action Plan to counter organized crime, new authorities are organizing to draft a completely new plan, which will disregard the work developed throughout 2019.","text - criminal justice and security":"There are no judiciary-related units in Guinea-Bissau with the specific aim of countering organized crime. Additionally, the judiciary is assessed as being weak, poorly resourced and corrupt. Judicial authorities are also seen as biased and unproductive, which results in case backlogs, delays and rare convictions. Meanwhile, law enforcement in the country lacks basic training and suffers low and irregular wages. The police are also involved in arbitrary arrests of political figures, which demonstrate a strong politicization of law enforcement units. Overall, while law enforcement measures and frameworks exist, there are significant areas left for improvement, especially in terms of practical implementation. Meanwhile, Guinea-Bissau's borders appear to be porous and very vulnerable to the smuggling of illicit goods.

The diversification of the country's economy is a key issue but remains constrained due to weak regulatory quality and rule of law. Until recently, Guinea-Bissau\u2019s economic development was also constrained due to sanctions imposed on the country.

Sporadic governmental victim support measures rely heavily on NGOs. However, NGO facilities are so consistently overcrowded and underfunded that volunteers have been known to use their own homes to temporarily house victims. Furthermore, while traditionally Guinea-Bissau has received international donor support, it has not focused on building community resilience. Overall, civil-society organizations in Guinea-Bissau are relatively weak, under-resourced and fragmented. Although NGOs are generally free to operate in the country, they sometimes face intimidation and other obstacles. In addition, civil-society organizations do not focus on organized crime but rather on governance-related issues. With regard to the media sector, free press is a constitutional right, but is often restricted in reality. Furthermore, access to information is difficult and certain subjects, such as organized crime, issues of governance and the influence of the military on politics in the country, are taboo, which leads journalists to self-censor. There have been several recorded attacks on journalists as well.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Bissau","GDP (current $US million)":"1339.45","Income group":"Low income","Population":"1920922","Land Area (sq. km)":"36130","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"92","Freedom in the World Index":"44","Human Development Index":"0.48","Global Peace Index":"2.16","Democracy Index":"2.63","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"19","GDP per capita (current US$)":"697","1":"5.45","1.1":"4.90","1.2":"6.00","2":"2.42"},{"Corresp":"88","ISO-3":"KEN","Country":"Kenya","ISO-2":"KE","Continent":"Africa","Region":"East Africa","Flag file":"ke.png","1.

Human trafficking is a significant driver of Kenya\u2019s underground criminal economy. Additionally, human traffickers in Kenya reportedly collude with law enforcement officials to facilitate movement. Available information also suggests that East African human trafficking rings moving people to the Middle East are run entirely by people posing as legitimate recruiting agencies based in Kenya. Often Kenyans who irregularly migrate to the Middle East for better economic opportunity are subjected to domestic servitude, sexual abuse and acute violations of their terms of employment. Smugglers and traffickers also hold irregular migrants destined for the United Arab Emirates in \u2018trafficking houses\u2019. Ugandan and Nepali women have been trafficked into Kenya for the purposes of sexual exploitation. A new sex-trafficking route to India has also reportedly emerged, and there have been reported cases of Kenyan women being lured to India with the promise of employment. There has also been an alarming spike in online human-trafficking recruitment and the exploitation of children. Authorities in Kenya have also raised concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic would exacerbate the issue, as children remain at home and are often online. ##&& Kenya is a significant hub for human smuggling in East Africa, and new smuggling hotspots have been emerging across the country in recent years. Kenya\u2019s role in the human smuggling industry has shifted from that of a destination country to primarily that of a transit country. Most smuggled people in Kenya come from the Horn of Africa. Kenyans seeking to reach the Middle East often employ the services of smugglers. Overall, Kenya\u2019s human smuggling market overlaps heavily with the country\u2019s human trafficking and forced labour markets, with Kenyan and Ugandan recruitment agencies reportedly collaborating on smuggling and trafficking operations. ","text - trade":"Arms trafficking is a significant issue in Kenya, with high numbers of unlicensed and illicit firearms circulating in the country due to it being near conflict-ridden areas. Kenya is primarily a hub for arms trafficked to conflict zones in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Uganda. Border porosity and the phenomenon of cattle theft are also believed to exacerbate the issue. High-level political and government officials are also reportedly linked to arms trafficking and the sale of small arms and light weapons to warring factions in South Sudan. Criminal gangs have reportedly turned to schoolchildren, young boys and women to aid the import of illicit firearms. Overall, arms trafficking has contributed to a rise in firearm-related homicides in Nairobi. The Kenyan government has made concerted efforts to collect civilian arms, as a result of which the number of illicit arms in circulation in the country has likely decreased, but the COVID-19 pandemic along with increased terrorist activities have contributed to the subsequent increase of the scope and scale of the market.","text - environment":"Despite a 1986 ban on logging indigenous tree species, illicit logging of indigenous trees continues to occur in Kenya, in large part due to government corruption. Ports such as Mombasa serve as transit hubs for illicit timber products trafficked across East Africa. Additionally, sandalwood is illicitly harvested and often destined for markets in Uganda, Saudi Arabia and India. The charcoal trade has also fuelled illicit logging in Kenya, and there are claims that criminal proceeds contribute to the funding of al-Shabaab militants hiding in the forest. Not least of all, the pandemic has pushed an increased number of unemployed people to target forest resources, exacerbating the issue even further. ##&& Wildlife trafficking is widespread in Kenya. In particular, illicit ivory, rhino horn, African Grey parrot and venomous snake markets are extremely prevalent. Kenya is also a major transit country for wildlife trafficking, with the port of Mombasa and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport being the main entry and exit points for illegal wildlife products. Wildlife trafficking between Kenya and Asia is particularly predominant and Asian criminal syndicates have reportedly established bases in the country. High levels of violence are associated with the wildlife-trafficking market in Kenya. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, poaching for bushmeat has reportedly increased across Kenya. ##&& In regards to non-renewable resource crimes, Kenya acts as both a destination and transit country for mineral smuggling. Most smuggled minerals originate in the DRC and are trafficked through Kenya for \u2018legitimization\u2019 before being sold to foreign markets as Kenyan products. Mineral smugglers often have ties to politicians in both Kenya and the DRC. Oil smuggling is also known to occur in Kenya. Kenya\u2019s illicit gold market involves gold smuggled into the country from the DRC, Tanzania and South Sudan. The illicit gold market may be tied to the role Kenya plays as a safe haven for political elites fleeing political strife in Sudan.","text - drugs":"Kenya is a major waypoint for various illicit narcotics, including heroin from Afghanistan and the Arabian Gulf en route to Europe, the Americas and other parts of Africa. Heroin hubs continue to grow in Kenya, with experts attributing the heroin boom to unplanned urbanization, weak governance, and widespread corruption among Kenyan police and politicians. A significant nexus exists between heroin trafficking and other crimes in Kenya. However, no one specific criminal group controls the trade. Domestic heroin abuse in Kenya is a significant issue, especially along the coastline. Kenya is also an important transit country for cocaine en route to European, American, Asian and Middle Eastern markets. Cocaine is either imported using air routes from South America to neighbouring Ethiopia, or more commonly, transported by air from neighbouring African states, particularly those in western Africa. Nigerian syndicates and Italian mafia groups often control international shipments. In particular, the airport in Nairobi remains a significant trans-shipment point for the global cocaine trade. As a destination country, Kenya also has a growing domestic market. Furthermore, the Kenyan police have been identified as the primary organizers and facilitators of the domestic distribution and retail sale of cocaine in the country. ##&& A significant cannabis-trafficking market exists in Kenya as it is the most prevalent drug in the country. Cannabis is cultivated and produced in Kenya for domestic and regional consumption and seizure rates of cannabis in the country are ranked among the highest on the continent. Over the course of 2020, Kenya has also become a significant market for bhang coming from neighbouring Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda. Kenya also has one of the highest cannabis seizure rates in Africa. However, in many cases, authorities allegedly report the seizure of hard drugs as cannabis seizures in order to keep them for their own use. Cannabis is cultivated in protected areas such as forest reserves, and often shielded by local administrators. Thus, a number of political and public servants have been linked to cannabis trafficking in Kenya. The country\u2019s synthetic-drug market is expanding, especially in terms of domestic consumption. Synthetic cannabis and opioids, as well as new psychoactive substances, are widely available in the country. Moreover, Kenya is believed to serve as a transit country for amphetamines trafficked to South Africa and across Southern Asia. Nevertheless, Kenya\u2019s synthetic drug market is smaller than other drug markets in the country.","text - criminal actors":"A large number of violent, predominately military-style and extortionist gangs operate in Kenya. The groups are territorial and operate under defined leadership. They collaborate with law-enforcement officers, politicians, bankers and other corrupt officials who both sponsor and facilitate their criminal activity. Corrupt police officers and politicians also employ criminal gang members as bodyguards, election agents, campaigners and tools for harassing political rivals. Mafia capitalism has also been on the rise in Kenya, and an increasing number of cartels have been involved in human trafficking, cybercrime, virtual kidnapping and the sale of counterfeit goods. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, criminal gangs have reportedly increased their recruitment practices and increasingly engaged in violence. Meanwhile, smaller criminal enterprises, rather than large organized mafia-style groups, tend to dominate smuggling markets in Kenya. Several small criminal networks control the regional heroin trade. Vigilante groups have formed in opposition to these networks, and violence between the two types of actors commonly occurs. Criminal networks often harbour ties to politicians and other influential individuals, and thus wield significant influence across the country. Some criminal networks, especially those involved in human trafficking, human smuggling and drug trafficking, have transnational links to counterparts abroad. ##&& State-embedded corruption runs rampant in Kenya. As mentioned above, politicians are known to offer protection to criminal syndicates. Drug traffickers are also known to be involved in politics, and some have run for office in the past. Moreover, in many cases, top bureaucrats and law-enforcement officers have become wealthy due to their involvement in drug trafficking in particular. With regards to foreign actors, they have a strong presence due to excessive levels of organized crime in the country. The Kenyan government has deported an estimated 3 000 foreign nationals accused of criminal activity. The Italian mafia is notably present both in Kenya and across East Africa, and engages in various criminal activities, while a large number of smugglers from neighbouring countries operate in Kenya. Asian nationals, primarily originating in China, are also known to be involved in drug and fauna trafficking in Kenya. Foreign criminal actors are heavily involved in targeting children for human-trafficking operations.","text - leadership and governance":"Although the Kenyan government has made concerted efforts to combat organized crime, the country\u2019s political system remains compromised. Criminal influence in politics undermines good governance. As a large number of opposition parties are sponsored by individuals involved in drug trafficking, their leaders often fail to publicly condemn organized crime. Corruption also runs rampant in the government. While oversight mechanisms exist, implementation remains limited. Nevertheless, Kenya has one of the best anti-organized crime and anti-corruption legislative frameworks in the region. This legislation requires the public to be involved in budget-making and for public tenders to be published before being awarded. However, blatant abuse of procurement still occurs in large projects. ##&& On the international level, Kenya has ratified several international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. Kenya maintains good relations with African states and the EU, and also has a strategic security partnership with the US. Kenya cooperates well with neighbouring states and engages in information sharing and crime investigation, notably on cyber security and tax-related issues. Kenya has also partnered with 14 of its neighbours to establish a counter-terrorism think-tank. However, Kenya\u2019s relationship with Somalia remains hostile. On the domestic level, Kenya has one of the best constitutional frameworks against organized crime in the region. Although the government introduced a policy of collecting civilian arms, the implementation of said policies remains limited and plagued by institutional conflict. Moreover, crimes such as drug use carry unnecessarily harsh penalties. The country\u2019s human-trafficking law stipulates for offenders to serve prison time, but does not cover the protection of citizens against human trafficking. Meanwhile, there is limited reference to poaching and wildlife trafficking in the country\u2019s legislation.","text - criminal justice and security":"Kenya\u2019s judicial system is impartial but judicial efficacy is undermined by weak institutional capacity and significant backlogs. The senior levels of the judiciary have also accused the executive branch of interference with judicial independence. Moreover, delayed cases have provided opportunities for influence and compromise of judicial outcomes. Other major issues in the judicial system are impunity, with individuals being arrested and released without charges, and corruption. In regards to law enforcement, corruption is high and violence towards citizens on the part of police officers remains a significant issue in the country. In instances of seizures, the police often pocket crime proceeds. Weak coordination between various law-enforcement units also undermines efficiency. Kenya has specific police formations tasked with combating organized crime. However, the investigative capacity of law-enforcement bodies is almost non-existent. As for territorial integrity, Kenya's main security focus is on its northern border with Somalia, in large part due to the threat posed by al-Shabaab. Moreover, borders are insufficiently policed, and illicit trade in various commodities continues largely unabated. Nevertheless, Kenya continues to take subtle measures to prevent criminals, particularly terrorists, from entering the country.","text - economic and financial environment":"Kenya has a moderately high level of economic freedom, particularly when compared to most African states. Authorities have also developed mechanisms to ease the process of doing business in Kenya. Nevertheless, corruption and ethnic politics often negate this progress. Moreover, criminals reportedly have established banks, credit facilities and money-loaning institutions that enable them to engage in money laundering. Kenya\u2019s informal economy is also extremely large and a significant portion of the country\u2019s foreign financial inflows comprise remittances from Kenyans who work abroad. While Kenya has anti-money laundering legislation and policies in place aimed at combating money laundering, these measures have not been effective due to rampant corruption at all levels of government and politics. A wide range of actors engaging in money laundering in both the formal and informal economy also renders reporting uncommon. As such, Kenya is assessed to have one of the highest risks of money laundering and terrorist financing worldwide.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Kenyan government implemented a witness-protection programme following post-election violence. However, crime victims continue to lack sufficient protection in the country. Most shelters in the country are run by private organizations and cannot handle excess numbers of victims. There has been some progress regarding organized crime and terrorism prevention in the country, including the introduction of a campaign to collect illicit arms from civilians, as well as a multi-sectoral effort to prevent, control and mitigate drug crimes. Kenya\u2019s government has also made significant efforts to curb the financing of terrorist groups. Nevertheless, these crimes remain prevalent in Kenya, and are often facilitated by corrupt police and politicians. ##&& Kenyan civil society has traditionally been successful in lobbying for citizens\u2019 rights and against harmful legislation, corruption and various forms of organized crime. However, the number of organizations operating in Kenya has declined significantly in recent years because of unavailability of funding as well as active efforts on part of the government to silence the civil society sector. An increasing number of civil-society actors have also been arrested and charged with petty offences throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, there has been a decline in media freedom in the country. Threats against journalists and media outlets are common, and these threats are heightened during election campaigns. Both private and state media outlets in the country are heavily influenced by the political elite.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Nairobi","GDP (current $US million)":"95503.09","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"52573973","Land Area (sq. km)":"580370","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"89.2","Freedom in the World Index":"48","Human Development Index":"0.6","Global Peace Index":"2.38","Democracy Index":"5.05","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"31","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1817","1":"6.95","1.1":"6.65","1.2":"7.25","2":"5.21"},{"Corresp":"97","ISO-3":"LSO","Country":"Lesotho","ISO-2":"LS","Continent":"Africa","Region":"Southern Africa","Flag file":"ls.png","1.

Due to the country\u2019s location, human trafficking victims from Lesotho are primarily trafficked into various parts of South Africa. In many cases, human traffickers lure unsuspecting irregular Basotho migrants into forced labour and sexual exploitation with the promise of employment and better economic opportunity in South Africa. While Basotho men and children are often subjected to forced labour in the herding industry or on farms, women and girls are often forced into sexual slavery. Corrupt officials are known to collude with these traffickers. Infant theft and smuggling from Lesotho to South Africa has also emerged as a recent phenomenon. ##&& Lesotho\u2019s close proximity to South Africa, along with South Africa\u2019s higher living standard, renders irregular migration between the two countries common. While legal migration schemes between the two countries have been successful in providing protection for migrant workers, irregular migration persists. Those involved in the market tend to be low-level actors, and minimal state intervention or regulation occurs.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking is not a significant issue in Lesotho. Nevertheless, small numbers of small arms are often smuggled into the country from South Africa and used for opportunistic crime in urban centres. Unlicensed gun ownership is also a fairly common occurrence in Lesotho and, as a result, the country has high rates of arms-related homicides.","text - environment":"No evidence points towards the existence of a significant flora-related crimes market in Lesotho. However, there are some reports of protected medicinal plants being over-harvested, such as various aloe species. In regards to fauna crimes, stock theft is a significant issue in Lesotho and quite common along the country\u2019s border with South Africa. Cattle thieves are also known to use small arms to steal cattle. Horses are also reportedly stolen in southern Lesotho on occasion. However, overall the country\u2019s isolated geographical position means that there are few opportunities to traffic wildlife out of its territory. As for non-renewable resource crimes, diamond smuggling is a common occurrence in Lesotho. Moreover, high rates of poverty, political instability, political mismanagement and corrupt practices all play a significant role in undermining efforts to control the diamond sector. The illicit diamond trade in Lesotho involves both small-scale, artisanal miners as well as large diamond-mining companies.","text - drugs":"Cannabis is the most commonly consumed and traded drug in Lesotho. While Lesotho is at the forefront of an emerging medicinal cannabis industry, there are still illicit flows in the country which involve corrupt and compromised officials and public figures. Lesotho is a destination and transit country for a small-scale but growing market for heroin trafficked overland from Mozambique and other countries in East Africa to South Africa. The domestic heroin market in Lesotho is supplied almost exclusively from the city of Bloemfontein in South Africa. Corrupt law enforcement workers and other high-level officials in the country facilitate the trade. ##&& Besides cannabis, cocaine is the most widely used illicit drug in Lesotho. Like the market for heroin, the cocaine market in Lesotho is inextricably linked to Bloemfontein. Lesotho is a rapidly growing cocaine consumer market, facilitated by corrupt law enforcement employees, high-level state officials and well-known professionals. Meanwhile, synthetic-drug use and trafficking are quite limited. However, Lesotho does have a small but growing domestic methamphetamine market. ","text - criminal actors":"Criminal networks in Lesotho commonly engage in illicit activities such as vehicle theft and smuggling, diamond smuggling, human trafficking, livestock theft and drug trafficking. A moderate level of violence is associated with these activities, particularly in the case of vehicle hijackings. Criminal networks in Lesotho are often affiliated to political parties, and as a result corruption runs rampant in the country. Low-level state-embedded actors are easily corrupted and allow criminal actors to avoid arrest and prosecution. In particular, government officials have been implicated in human trafficking, stock theft and motor vehicle theft. ##&& Most foreign criminal actors in Lesotho are South Africa-based criminal networks that engage in vehicle theft and smuggling and use Lesotho as a hub to re-register stolen cars. However, South African criminals are also known to be involved in cannabis smuggling, stock theft and attacks on farms in Lesotho. Moreover, Basotho and South African criminals are known to collude in various criminal markets. Chinese nationals are believed to be involved in the trafficking of other Chinese nationals for sexual exploitation in Lesotho. Meanwhile, there is no evidence of mafia-style groups operating in the country.","text - leadership and governance":"A history of coups and political instability has left the government in a precarious position. Governance structures, particularly those relating to criminal justice, remain functional, but weak. The government has also not sufficiently identified areas of concern nor articulated measures to address them. Moreover, corruption levels in the country are concerning. ##&& On the international level, Lesotho is generally open to cooperation and is a signatory to a number of international agreements. The country holds bilateral agreements with neighbouring South Africa, which has aided in reducing human smuggling, and provided protection to Basotho migrant workers. On the domestic level, the government has successfully passed legislation and accompanying policies to address multiple categories of crime. However, not all acts of legislation are consistent with international standards. In particular, the length of prescribed sentences is often deemed inadequate.","text - criminal justice and security":"Overall, the independence of Lesotho\u2019s judiciary is questionable, and it is often subject to political manipulation. Consequently, judicial efforts to combat organized crime are frequently hampered by backlogs and judicial crises. Meanwhile, law enforcement bodies tasked with organized crime prevention are plagued by inefficiency and a lack of legitimacy. Torture while in custody has been reported, and there are high levels of mistrust in the police. Meanwhile there is friction between the police and the military, which has at various times followed conflict between political factions. The country\u2019s only borders, with South Africa, are quite porous and smuggling occurs regularly. While the deployment of South African National Defence Force troops to the border has somewhat tightened border security, the border itself remains easily passable.","text - economic and financial environment":"Due to its small size, Lesotho is largely dependent on trade with South Africa, and is thus highly susceptible to South African market fluctuations. Recent developments regarding Lesotho\u2019s legal trade of cannabis with Canada, along with its legal trade of diamonds with South Africa, have stimulated the economy. However, a lack of control of cannabis cultivation paired with relatively easy public access to diamonds renders the regulation of both commodities difficult. Lesotho has legislation and a national policy against money laundering in place, and a financial intelligence unit was established to combat the problem. The Commercial Crimes Court also aids in the fight against money laundering. Nevertheless, the risk of money laundering remains significantly high in the country.","text - civil society and social protection":"Treatment for victims of crime is available in Lesotho. However, victim-support services are generally reserved for human trafficking victims and are insufficient in most cases. Meanwhile, active efforts to prevent crime in Lesotho are hampered by poor training and the complicity of corrupt officials in certain criminal activities. In particular, the practical challenge of border management combined with high levels of destitution in Lesotho complicate crime prevention. Furthermore, civil-society organizations in Lesotho are reportedly inactive and hampered by lack of funds. However, the Catholic Church is very powerful in the country, and has worked tirelessly to expose corruption in the diamond industry. The media in Lesotho also lack freedom. Some journalists have reportedly fled to South Africa as a result of the heightened levels of intimidation they are faced with, while those who remain in Lesotho often practise self-censorship.

For the most part, victims are Liberian citizens who are trafficked within the country. While exploitation is widespread, it is rarely facilitated by an organized criminal network. Perpetrators are rather members of the victims' extended families or part of their communities. Notably, forced begging is the most organized of these exploitative activities. Foreign victims, mostly young women originating from other countries in the West African region, are also trafficked into Liberia \u2212 largely by their families for arranged or forced marriages. There are some known instances of international trafficking of women from Eastern Europe and northern Africa brought to Liberia for sex work and domestic labour, and there are also some instances of Liberians, typically young women, being taken to Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East under contested circumstances. ##&& Human smuggling within Liberia is a low-level, low-profit and broadly violence-free operation. Liberia\u2019s borders are porous and poorly guarded. In most cases, Liberians en route to the Middle East are abandoned by smugglers in the Sahara desert when trying to cross the borders into Niger or left stranded in northern Africa. The human smuggling market is not dominated by organized crime syndicates, but it has surely facilitated the growth and formation of criminal groups in the country. ","text - trade":"The level of firearm and ammunition smuggling in Liberia is moderate, but it is still a prevailing issue in the country. Liberia was known to transfer arms to Sierra Leone during its embargo period from 1992 to 2016, while the Liberian civil war also led to massive flows of illicit arms. Today, there is little evidence of military-grade material moving through Liberia. Instead, there is the smuggling of artisanal single-barrel pistols and shotguns, which are used in armed robberies. The country\u2019s old smuggling routes are still viable for arms trafficking. Additionally, the country\u2019s open seas continue to offer easy access to arms brokers.","text - environment":"The promotion of massive illegal logging by international logging and agricultural firms has posed a major threat to Liberia\u2019s forests. This threat is amplified by the country\u2019s poor legal and regulatory protections. Moreover, logging often happens with permits obtained through bribery, although some success in countering the illegal felling of trees has been registered over the past two years. Liberia is also a major site for wildlife trafficking as well as poaching, which includes the widespread hunting of animals for bushmeat, also used in cultural practices across the country. Moreover, the domestic market is intertwined with the international wildlife trade. Importantly, Liberian marine wildlife is also threatened and endangered as a result of the illegal trade. In regards to non-renewable resource crimes, most mining of gold and diamonds in the country is ungoverned by national authorities. The smuggling of gold and diamonds is prevalent, especially along the border Liberia shares with Guinea. The industries provide a livelihood to many actors and involve criminals and local elites alike. Additionally, Lebanese families with connections to Belgium and the United Arab Emirates dominate the diamond trade, both legal and illegal. Nevertheless, the volumes involved in the illegal gold and diamond industries are not very large in absolute terms, compared to other countries, but are still fairly significant given the size of Liberia.","text - drugs":"Cannabis is widely available in Liberia, which is a major producer and consumer of the drug. The trade between Liberia and Sierra Leone is particularly robust, but movement into Guinea and up through the Sahel is another significant route. Additionally, consumption of cannabis has increased since the country\u2019s civil conflict. Information on cannabis producers is lacking, though larger production operations are arguably either part of known gangs or tied to them. Liberia is also a dynamic waypoint for cocaine originating in Latin America. Liberian officials believe there is a slightly larger domestic market for cocaine than heroin, but it is considered small-scale compared to other countries. Although the country has a comparatively limited domestic market, the trade has had a significant impact on regional drug-consumption habits, particularly the rise in crack cocaine consumption. ##&& While it has a limited domestic market, Liberia continues to be an important hub for heroin from Latin American and Asian producing countries destined for the European markets. Liberian territory, especially the ports, offers excellent opportunities for heroin smugglers to exploit, which arguably fuels the growing domestic market as well. Naturally, these illicit flows pose a persistent challenge for law enforcement. Conversely, the population reportedly lacks the disposable income necessary to purchase synthetic drugs, which is why the market is negligible. While there has been a rise in the prevalence of amphetamine-type stimulants within Liberia, empirical evidence for this is missing. ","text - criminal actors":"Criminal networks in Liberia appear to largely consist of young people that are tied by family, ethnic or conflict-era links, and play a small, niche and detrimental role in Liberian society. For the most part, the members of these loose networks are Liberian, although there is some evidence to suggest that foreign individuals are involved as well. Overall, the protracted civil conflict led to the departure of many foreign nationals in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Nevertheless, there are still some African and non-African individuals involved in criminal networks within the country. The typical operational structure of Liberian groups has its roots in both traditional loosely structured West African criminal networks and structures that have emerged during the civil war. These gangs, mostly engaging in the distribution of drugs and armed robbery, are active largely in urban areas, but available information suggests they operate to a lesser extent in remote or rural area as well. ##&& In regards to state-embedded actors, the private sector in Liberia is reportedly being subjected to increasing levels of corruption, including bribery demands from senior government officials, which worsen the country\u2019s business environment. While ubiquitous corruption that permeates state structures also undermines trust in institutions, there is little evidence that the state-embedded actors control criminal markets. Although most gangs in the country are semi-organized and non-permanent, there are a number of groups with structures that resemble a mafia-like groups. These have known names and an organized hierarchy, engaging in extortion and drug trafficking. The risk of mafia-like gangs increasing their influence in Liberia, however, is minimal at this point in time.","text - leadership and governance":"Under the current administration\u2019s policy agenda, countering the influence of criminal networks and organized crime is not a priority. This is in part because of the Ebola virus outbreak, which shifted the focus to the country\u2019s weak health system and economy. Moreover, although the government has shown some commitment to limit the influence of organized crime groups and prevent them from securing a major foothold in the country, it is not in the position to achieve that due to lack of resources and technical capacity. Meanwhile, corruption remains a big problem in every sphere of Liberian society, including many sectors of government and the private sector. A significant pool of donor funds also fuels public corruption. Additionally, since taking office, the current government has further undermined accountability institutions by eliminating the tenure of office holders and appointing political allies without relevant backgrounds or skills. ##&& On the international level, Liberia is also party to a number of treaties pertaining to organized crime. Thus, there has been an ongoing effort to reform laws in order to align the country's legislative framework with international conventions. However, Liberia\u2019s legal frameworks are not consistent with international instruments related to the smuggling of migrants and human rights. In regards to the drug laws, while they are crafted from a criminalization perspective, there is punitive disparity that favours traffickers over users. Meanwhile, wildlife rangers have intensified efforts to arrest and confiscate endangered species that are protected under the banner of the Liberian wildlife law.","text - criminal justice and security":"Liberia\u2019s justice system has severe capacity gaps in the form of insufficient numbers of prosecutors, public defenders and judges, and their ensuing high workload contributes to the very slow progress of court cases. Furthermore, most Liberians seek justice outside of formal legal channels because they do not trust the formal legal system to produce results, and believe that proceeding through formal mechanisms require costly bribes. Additionally, the system is overburdened and lengthy pre-trial detention is common, which leads to prison overcrowding in poor conditions. The primary law enforcement entity in Liberia is the Liberia National Police, but the agency reportedly suffers from a lack of resources. However, special law-enforcement units such as the Liberia Drug Enforcement Agency do exist. Liberian law enforcement has been involved in some large drug busts, but these are usually the result of joint operations with US counterparts, demonstrating the lack of professional capacity of national agencies and their reliance on international cooperation. Liberia has a poor road system, which makes access of authorities to remote areas difficult, in essence limiting their scope of coverage to Monrovia. The insufficient management of borders also contributes to most organized-crime activities in the country.","text - economic and financial environment":"Income in Liberia is low and the economy is heavily reliant on remittances from the Liberian diaspora abroad as well as on foreign aid. Most Liberians have very limited access to health care, education or other government services. Doing legitimate business in the country is extremely difficult. Moreover, Liberia is at a significant risk of illicit flows, including trafficking of drugs and money laundering. Despite the government\u2019s efforts to strengthen its anti-money laundering regime, implementation is often impeded. Liberia\u2019s financial intelligence unit also lacks the equipment as well as the know-how to effectively gather, evaluate and produce financial intelligence. Furthermore, a number of factors, including limited capabilities of law enforcement and justice institutions, poor financial transparency and record keeping, corruption and political interference, often impede investigations related to money laundering.","text - civil society and social protection":"Awareness of human trafficking is missing both among the public and law enforcement authorities, which, coupled with the lack of resources, means most victims of trafficking remain unidentified. The government also does not consistently promote the participation of victims in the investigative process and in the prosecution of perpetrators of human trafficking. On occasion, authorities would grant food, shelter and transport to human trafficking victims to testify during trials. Witness protection programmes are essentially non-existent. Meanwhile, the country has a vibrant civil society that works in various areas of human rights protection, security-sector reform, governance and accountability. In spite of some NGOs working on preventing illicit logging, poaching and mining, non-state actors do not for the most play a significant role in combating organized crime in Liberia. The current administration has promised to support greater media freedom, but there is continued uncertainty about certain draconian provisions, and self-censorship is widespread. Moreover, most media outlets still lack financial autonomy and depend on government contracts or funding from politicians.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Monrovia","GDP (current $US million)":"3070.52","Income group":"Low income","Population":"4937374","Land Area (sq. km)":"111370","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"89.5","Freedom in the World Index":"60","Human Development Index":"0.48","Global Peace Index":"1.88","Democracy Index":"5.32","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"28","GDP per capita (current US$)":"622","1":"5.05","1.1":"5.10","1.2":"5.00","2":"3.17"},{"Corresp":"99","ISO-3":"LBY","Country":"Libya","ISO-2":"LY","Continent":"Africa","Region":"North Africa","Flag file":"ly.png","1.

There has been an increasing trend in human trafficking over the past few years. Moreover, human trafficking is closely intertwined with human smuggling, as irregular migration into the country often develops into trafficking incidents. Labour exploitation is particularly notable among sub-Saharan migrants in the country. In 2020, trafficking involved a greater incidence of Bangladeshi migrants arriving in the country on work visas, with many ending up in exploitative environments. There are also reports of individuals as young as 13 years being lured into mercenary work in southern Libya. The COVID-19 restrictions reduced air routes out of Libya and have increased the reliance on overland routes. ##&& Since 2017, there has been a substantial decline in human-smuggling activities and the protection offered by militia groups in Libya. Additionally, lower coastal departure numbers from Libya to Europe have been registered compared to other Mediterranean routes. In 2020, this trend was particularly noticeable during the first quarter of the year, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, later in the year, many smugglers adapted to the new circumstances, with some operating along the route between Niger and Libya. In 2020, human-smuggling activities in Libya were characterized by relatively small and less organized groups. Smuggling is generally associated with high levels of violence and high death rates. The state has little control over the entire territory and many state officials reportedly benefit from the profits of migrant smuggling.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking in Libya has fuelled conflict in the region. The proliferation of illicit arms was escalated by the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi and the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Despite the arms embargo, arms transfers to Libya from other states continue, albeit representing only a fraction of all arms trafficking in the country. Most arms dealers are relatively small and play a mediator role between different actors. Other enabling structures, such as offshore banking, offshore companies and jurisdictions with low levels of enforcement and high levels of corruption, play a much more significant role in facilitating arms transfers. Libya also serves as a major source country for weapons trafficked to neighbouring countries.","text - environment":"Oil products such as petrol and diesel are at the centre of Libya\u2019s smuggling industry. Most of the fuel smuggled out of the country is imported rather than produced, and is then sold at a heavily subsidised rate, offering substantial profit margins to smugglers. To date, there is no evidence that crude oil has been exported illegally from Libya. Overall, there has been a substantial decline in large-scale sea-bound fuel smuggling. However, there have been reports of large-scale transfers of subsidized fuel in the east of Libya in 2019 and 2020. There is some gold-mining activity taking place in the southern parts of Libya, with gold being smuggled into the country. Criminal and armed groups are involved in the process. In regards to fauna crimes, there is illegal hunting of birds for the local and external markets. In particular, since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011 and the increase in arms trafficking, a notable increase in unregulated shooting has been recorded. Different species of birds are targeted, including quail, golden oriole, doves, falcons for falconry and trade, ducks for recreational hunting, medium-sized waders, greater flamingos, herons and the houbara bustard. Meanwhile, the illicit flora trade is non-existent in Libya.","text - drugs":"Libya is a major transit country for cannabis from Morocco destined for Egypt and then Europe. Most major shipments of cannabis transit through cities, towns and farmlands in the south of the country. A local market also exists and most notably, hashish consumption has increased in Libya\u2019s major coastal cities since 2011. The cannabis market funds a number of criminal networks, including those involved in other illicit markets. Libya has been characterized as a transit country for the cocaine trade from West Africa, which has declined in recent years. While there is a growing internal market, this is mostly restricted to some circles within the capital and other main towns. There is increasing evidence of coastal spots in Libya being used for the delivery and storage of cocaine in significant quantities that is destined for re-export to Europe and Egypt. Furthermore, senior officials are reported to have links to drug trafficking, including cocaine. ##&& There is strong evidence of prescription pharmaceuticals transiting the ports and southern borders of Libya and being consumed in the country. This increasing trend includes drugs such as Tramadol, Rivotril and Captagon. There is anecdotal evidence from smugglers that the scale of Tramadol trafficking appears to have significantly diminished during 2020, largely due to supply-side reforms. The heroin market in Libya is relatively small. Insofar as the market exists, the drug is primarily trafficked through the city of Sebha or enters Libya in small amounts from Egypt. As the country returns to peace, it might become vulnerable to the heroin trade.","text - criminal actors":"Libya has a diverse range of mafia-style militia groups, with different names and clearly identifiable leaders. These groups are well armed and not only dominate different criminal markets, but hold more control over specific areas in the country than the government. Notably, however, compared to more established mafia groups in other parts of the world, Libyan counterparts do not possess the same degree of sophistication and organization. Criminal entrepreneurs are also present in Libya. They tend to be individual families with political affiliations, using quasi-corporate structures to import and export a wide range of commodities. In particular, large-scale arms supplies from foreign states to different Libyan parties create new opportunities for criminal networks to proliferate in the country. ##&& Over the last couple of years, organized crime in Libya has largely been linked to the proximity of militia groups and criminal actors to the political class. In some cases, this closeness creates an interdependence, whereby the political process is indirectly dependent on the proceeds of organized crime. Meanwhile, there are very few foreign criminal actors in Libya. Given Libya\u2019s historically strong state structure, few foreign actors have been able to take control of criminal economies in the country.","text - leadership and governance":"There is little to no political leadership and governance in Libya on organized-crime issues. The government of national accord has been described as weak and unable to give direction or control territory. The approach of different governing entities in Libya is consistently characterized by a co-option approach. The state has been involved in a co-option strategy for activities such as human smuggling and fuel. In the east, the Libyan National Army (LNA) projects an appearance of strength, propagating an image of territorial control and the ability to bring basic security and services to the areas under its control. In reality, however, it has shown itself to be unable and unwilling to impinge on the criminal interests of significant tribes and militias that guarantee its territorial control in different parts of the Cyrenaica. Moreover, there is ample evidence of widespread corruption and capture of assets at the top of the LNA. Libya has one of the highest corruption perception levels in the world. ##&& On the international level, the state has little capacity to carry out its international obligations. In numerous cases, the state is unable to support external entities in criminal matters. Nevertheless, the state has attempted to assist the international community on human smuggling. Similar cooperation, but on a lower level, is present in efforts to counter fuel smuggling. On a domestic level, Libya\u2019s legislative framework pertaining to organized crime is very limited. Although Libyan law criminalizes some forms of sex trafficking, excluding cases involving adult male victims, forced labour is not criminalized in the country. A law passed in 2010 also criminalizes migrant smuggling, with harsher penalties for perpetrators belonging to organized criminal groups. There is also legislation prohibiting the manufacture, possession and sale of firearms. Nevertheless, judges in the country have complained that Libya\u2019s criminal code requires modernization to handle the evolving nature of organized crime.","text - criminal justice and security":"Libya\u2019s judicial system is poorly resourced, corrupt and fragmented. Militia groups have been known to impede the judicial system. Although significant warrants have been issued in the past years, the capacity to carry out these arrests and process them in fair trials is non-existent. Meanwhile, Libya\u2019s law enforcement is primarily outsourced to militia groups. Since around 2017, the situation has improved somewhat on the law-enforcement front. Some militias have been targeting different forms of organized crime. At the same time, there has been space for regime-era career officers to return to their positions in the security apparatus. In some cases, this has improved the performance of certain agencies, like the anti-drug agency. The course of action to be taken with security-sector reform is a key battleground that will likely influence the political landscape of the country going into 2021. In regards to territorial integrity, the government does not have the capacity to oversee the country\u2019s extensive borders. Divides among governments and city-states further complicate this.","text - economic and financial environment":"While Libya\u2019s economic regulatory capacity has improved, currency fraud remains widespread. Similarly, reform of fuel subsidies has not yet been introduced. The 2019\u20132020 Western Libya campaign on the one hand contributed to the delay of these and other much-needed reforms, while also further damaging the economy and pushing more people into the black market. Furthermore, Libya does not have the capacity to effectively tackle money laundering and worse still, the issue remains absent from the political agenda.","text - civil society and social protection":"Neither the Libyan state nor militia groups have the capacity to provide treatment and support to victims. Similarly, the Libyan government has no strategies, measures, resource allocation, programmes or processes that are aimed at preventing organized crime.

Socio-economic limitations contribute to increasing demand for arms among Malagasy youth. While domestic arms trafficking is a significant issue in Madagascar, the Malagasy national police service notes that international arms trafficking remains limited.","text - environment":"Environmental crimes are by far the most pervasive forms of organized crime in Madagascar. Deforestation is a significant issue in the country and is driven primarily by agricultural clearing and illicit logging for high-value timber species. Demand from China has been the most important driver of illegal logging since 2013. The market is largely facilitated by corruption and high-level political protection. The illicit trade in vanilla is also on the rise in Madagascar, with links to both illicit rosewood trafficking and money laundering. Notably, corrupt state officials facilitate the illicit trade in vanilla as well. ##&& Meanwhile, Madagascar\u2019s fauna crimes primarily involve the trafficking of reptiles such as tortoises, turtles, chameleons, geckos and snakes as well as birds, for the exotic pet trade and traditional medicine practices. Lemurs are poached in Madagascar for bushmeat and for the exotic pet trade, while the high levels of illegal fishing endanger seahorses and exotic fish species. Cattle raiding is another significant issue in the country. International wildlife-trafficking operations are believed to have decreased in recent years, in particular of those pertaining to tortoises and turtles, seizures of which peaked in 2018. ##&& Regarding non-renewable resource crimes, the illicit mining and smuggling of coloured gemstones are prevalent in Madagascar, particularly to Thailand. The market has a significant negative environmental impact. Meanwhile, illicit gold mining is a fairly recent phenomenon in Madagascar and is known to contribute to mercury contamination in freshwater ecosystems.","text - drugs":"Madagascar\u2019s low level of territorial integrity renders the country vulnerable to drug trafficking. The country is increasingly becoming a significant transit country for heroin, primarily trafficked by sea to East Africa from Afghanistan and Iran. Heroin traffickers in Madagascar reportedly tend to be of Nigerien, Tanzanian, Guinean, Mauritian or Seychellois descent. While the heroin trade has not significantly affected Malagasy society, domestic heroin consumption is known to occur, albeit primarily among wealthy foreign nationals. The domestic market for heroin was temporarily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the short-term as drug traffickers sought to offload larger quantities of drugs to avoid recurring export difficulties. Madagascar is both a destination and significant transit country for cocaine trafficked from South America through West Africa, and often onward to Middle Eastern and Asian markets. Widespread poverty and unemployment are believed to be key factors driving involvement in the illicit cocaine trade. Although the average age of cocaine consumers in Madagascar is decreasing, domestic cocaine consumption is nevertheless rather limited. ##&& Madagascar is a source, destination and transit country for the global cannabis trade. Cannabis is primarily cultivated in Ankarana, the northern district of Ambanja, and the southern region of Anosy, primarily in Mihariomby village. Madagascar\u2019s cannabis trade has proven to be quite lucrative, and as a result the country is also one of the top cannabis seizure locations in Africa. Poverty and unemployment are key factors in the rise of both cannabis dealing and consumption. Meanwhile, little evidence points to the existence of a significant synthetic-drug trade in Madagascar. However, limited methamphetamine trafficking does exist.","text - criminal actors":"While large, organized mafia-style groups do not appear to exist in Madagascar, small associations of criminals operate under internal directives and are known to be involved in the illicit-arms trade.

In the countryside, family criminal organizations take prevalence. Gangs are also known to operate in the country\u2019s larger cities, although their activities are largely limited to armed attacks in specified zones. Meanwhile, criminal networks also operate across Madagascar, and are involved in a wide range of criminal activities. Criminal networks involved in human trafficking are reportedly highly organized and collaborate with counterparts abroad, while drug trafficking networks are dominated by key figures who have controlled the country\u2019s illicit drug markets for many years. ##&& Corrupt government officials also play a significant role in the facilitation of criminal activities. Retired army officers, colonels and generals in southern Madagascar, in particular, are known to facilitate armed kidnappings and cattle rustling, as well as arms and drug trafficking. Moreover, the Malagasy government is known to be involved in organized criminal activities throughout the country and many Malagasy officials have been implicated in the facilitation of illegitimate financial transactions and the trafficking of illicit commodities. In regard to foreign actors, East Asian businessmen are key actors in Madagascar\u2019s illicit timber trade and drug kingpins from elsewhere in Africa are also significantly active in Madagascar\u2019s drug trafficking markets.

Similarly, despite the Malagasy government\u2019s efforts to prevent organized crimes, implementation remains a significant challenge. Organized crime prevention activities primarily include training and capacity-building initiatives, which are hosted both by local and international partners. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Malagasy Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Justice and national gendarmerie collaborated in a newly launched zero-tolerance project to combat organized crime, although successful results have been limited and the project has been criticized for the inconsistent treatment of criminal bosses and criminal followers. ##&& Malagasy civil society plays a significant role in the country\u2019s fight against organized crime. Private companies also participate in organized crime prevention activities by providing judicial and law enforcement bodies with essential resources. However, these activities are not held in high regard by the Malagasy government. Moreover, criminal libel laws and other restrictions often undermine freedom of speech in Madagascar.

Cocaine use is growing rapidly in the country and has become the second-most-consumed drug after cannabis. ##&& Malawi is a source country for cannabis \u2013 in particular, Malawi Gold, one of the most popular strains of cannabis in Africa. Despite strictly enforced laws (which make the growing of cannabis illegal except for medicinal and industrial purposes), cannabis production is centred in the Kasungu, Mzimba and Nkhotakota districts. Cannabis produced in Malawi is smuggled across Africa and into European markets. Malawi has a small domestic market for synthetic drugs, with methamphetamine and MDMA arriving overland from Mozambique. There is no significant production of synthetic drugs in Malawi.","text - criminal actors":"Actors from other African countries are reported to be heavily engaged in Malawian criminal markets \u2013 in particular, money laundering and the trafficking of humans, drugs and wildlife. Corruption is widespread in Malawi, which has given rise to an environment in which state actors facilitate organized crime. Key cases include a Malawian diplomat who was allegedly engaged in the trafficking of a domestic worker, a group of police officers who were convicted of trafficking wildlife products, and several public officials who were engaged in trafficking women to Kuwait. In 2020, a number of prominent officials were arrested for crimes that were committed during the previous administration, with the police stating that they were unable to make these arrests earlier due to the political environment. While there is little indication of domestic mafia-style groups in Malawi, the loose organized crime groups operating in the country are highly networked and engage in poly-trafficking, using one route to traffic multiple illicit products.","text - leadership and governance":"While the will exists to combat organized crime, as is evident in the partnerships Malawi has entered into with the UN on human trafficking, more needs to be done to improve the effectiveness of its anti-organized-crime measures. The government of Malawi is resilient, and there have been no adverse regime changes or coups in recent years. However, while there is overall confidence in the government, corruption is still perceived to be widespread. In fact, Malawi ranks among the countries with the highest corruption-perception levels worldwide, with many government and law-enforcement officials being accused of participating in various criminal markets but few ever facing any consequences for this. Most instances of state corruption have been in the human-trafficking and wildlife markets, with the Lilongwe Wildlife Trust raising government corruption as a potential factor in the inconsistency of sentencing across Malawi. Access to information in the country, however, appears to be relatively good. ##&& Malawi has signed and ratified most international treaties on organized crime. It has also cooperated with the United Nations and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species on initiatives to improve its response to human-trafficking and wildlife crime; and its financial intelligence unit has entered into several international memorandums of understanding in an effort to tackle money laundering. However, outside of its relationship with the UN and USAID, Malawi is fairly passive in terms of its international cooperation efforts and is not involved in any significant mutual extradition and legal-assistance agreements. ##&& Malawi\u2019s national policy infrastructure on organized crime needs improvement, especially with regard to the wildlife and human-trafficking markets. Monetary fines for wildlife trafficking are insignificant and do little to curb poaching, especially of ivory. However, improvements have been made in the form of recent national-park and wildlife acts, which provide for prison time of up to 30 years for wildlife offences. Upholding and enforcing these laws continues to be a challenge, but while the rule of law is not strong in Malawi, it is better than in the majority of African nations.","text - criminal justice and security":"Malawi\u2019s judiciary has demonstrated some resilience to organized crime and has improved in recent years. However, it remains largely reliant on support from its international partners. Because the lack of adequate punishment for environmental crime was severely impacting the effectiveness of Malawi\u2019s anti-trafficking initiatives, new measures were introduced in 2016 to address the situation. As a result, in the span of only three years (from 2016 to 2018), the percentage of custodial sentences increased from 3% to 77%. However, further improvements are still required as prosecutions are often inconsistent due to corruption. ##&& The Wildlife-Crime Investigations Unit, also established in 2016, has been very active across the country, as has the Inter-Agency Committee for Combating Wildlife Crime, which promotes communication and collaboration between all relevant law-enforcement agencies. While Malawi is successful in detecting instances of wildlife trafficking by air, its investigators lack sufficient resources and struggle to enforce its new laws against organized crime. Malawi\u2019s territorial integrity is weak, its borders are porous and its border mechanisms are inadequate. The country has therefore become a transit point for many forms of organized crime, with most criminal groups facing only minimal legal repercussions.","text - economic and financial environment":"International organizations, including the World Bank, are working with Malawian officials to improve their capacity to fight financial crime by, among other things, providing training to prosecutors and judges dealing with money-laundering cases. While Malawi\u2019s legal framework and mechanisms are generally solid, its enforcement of its anti-money-laundering laws and prosecution of financial crimes need improvement. The country\u2019s economic regulatory environment is poor, and improvement is needed in the control and management of its economy to allow trade to flourish within the rule of law. The informal economy is overdeveloped, which undermines the ease and attractiveness of doing business and investing in Malawi.","text - civil society and social protection":"While Malawi does not meet international standards in terms of its efforts to support the victims of modern-day slavery, it does have a national public-information campaign to spread awareness about the issue. The government engages with local communities through outreach initiatives, warning citizens of the perils of becoming involved in drug trafficking and the potential for their exploitation abroad. Training to help identify human-trafficking victims has been provided for labour inspectors and a number of law-enforcement officers. However, once these victims have been identified, a lack of resources limits how much long-term care and support is available for them. There are numerous initiatives in Malawi to prevent organized crime. These are both state-led and run in partnership with international organizations. Given the prominence of wildlife crime in Malawi, the government has increased penalties to deter offenders and crack down on the illicit market, and carried out many arrests in 2019. ##&& While media freedom was improving steadily in Malawi, with no journalists killed or imprisoned in 2018, the disputed presidential election that took place in 2019 negatively affected media freedom, with a number of press-freedom violations being reported by journalists.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Lilongwe","GDP (current $US million)":"7666.70","Income group":"Low income","Population":"18628747","Land Area (sq. km)":"118480","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"83.2","Freedom in the World Index":"66","Human Development Index":"0.48","Global Peace Index":"1.89","Democracy Index":"5.74","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"30","GDP per capita (current US$)":"412","1":"3.83","1.1":"4.15","1.2":"3.50","2":"4.29"},{"Corresp":"107","ISO-3":"MLI","Country":"Mali","ISO-2":"ML","Continent":"Africa","Region":"West Africa","Flag file":"ml.png","1.

In general, trafficking within the country appears to be more prevalent than cross-border trafficking activities. Since 2012, insurgents operating in northern parts of the country, including rebel and Islamic extremist groups, recruit children, mostly boys, for combat. As these groups become more active in controlling gold mining, prostitution in these areas is also being banned, leaving trafficked women and girls in precarious situations. Boys from Mali, as well as Guinea and Burkina Faso are victims of forced labour in various sectors. Outside of the country, Quranic teachers have been known to force Malian boys to beg or carry out agricultural jobs in neighbouring countries. Malian women and girls are victims of sex trafficking in other countries including Gabon, Libya, Lebanon and Tunisia, as well as of domestic servitude in the Middle East and North Africa. Females from other West African countries are lured to Mali with false promises of work but are then forced into sex trafficking instead. ##&& Malians rely on established but decentralized smuggling networks, including some of the Tuareg groups in the region, to facilitate their passage across borders. In the north of the country, smuggling activities are especially prevalent, where armed groups have taken control and offer protection to human smuggling operations. The production of fake and fraudulent documentation to support irregular movement in the region is rife in Mali.","text - trade":"Libya is an important source of illicit arms and ammunition for armed groups in Mali. These weapons include heavy machine guns mounted on 4\u00d74 vehicles. There has also been a proliferation of sophisticated and deadly small arms in central Mali, which likely come from looted stockpiles and might even be procured directly from Malian security forces. The issue of arms trafficking is increasing, in part because conflict is spreading into larger territories in the country.","text - environment":"Illicit logging is a considerable problem in Mali, particularly with criminals targeting its rosewood trees. Although Mali has a ban on the export of all raw wood, this has not prevented illegal exports to neighbouring countries and Asia. More than 3000 animal species in Mali are in serious danger of extinction due to poaching and the illegal trade in wildlife, including the furrowed turtle, the marbled teal, the Senegalese turtle, the white-headed vulture, hawks, chimpanzees, crocodiles, the Dama gazelle and elephants. However, with the closing of land and air borders due to the COVID-19 pandemic, fauna movement across borders has declined. With regard to non-renewable-resource crimes, evidence suggests that there is a significant trade in illicit gold between Mali and refineries in the UAE \u2013 and that government officials are involved. Armed groups control or have access to a number of artisanal mines in northern Mali and profit from their involvement in this illegal market.","text - drugs":"Although Mali is not a significant producer of cocaine, it is an important transit hub. Its northern region bordering Algeria and Niger is a key transit point for cocaine coming from Latin America and destined for Europe and the Middle East. Members of various armed groups are involved in cocaine trafficking, resulting in violent clashes between rivals. Despite widespread evidence of the illicit cocaine trade, seizures are very rare, suggesting the involvement of government actors at a national as well as local level. Heroin is imported into Mali mostly by air, often via so-called in-person couriers. As a result of the closure of airports due to COVID-19 however, the trade has seen a major decline. ##&& Cannabis is cultivated on small scale in Mali, predominantly for domestic consumption. More importantly, Mali is a trans-shipment point for the regional cannabis market, with the drug being moved through neighbouring countries as part of the larger Sahel trafficking network en route to European markets. As with cocaine, armed groups are directly involved in the trafficking of cannabis resin, and there has been violence as a result of the competition between them. Mali is a transit country for synthetic drugs, particularly Tramadol and methamphetamines. These drugs usually come from Nigeria and are intended for foreign markets, as well as for increasing domestic consumption. There are concerns but no tangible evidence of production taking place in the country.","text - criminal actors":"Corruption and misappropriation of state resources take place at all levels of Mali's government. Clientelism and nepotism are prevalent in the country, while major traffickers have become involved in the political arena, and their influence in electoral campaigns in the north is particularly strong. Some leaders of organized-crime groups have even embarked on political careers, while other traffickers are linked to the state through their ventures in the legal economy, where they are able to diversify their activities and launder profits. ##&& Criminal networks are prevalent across the country, and numerous armed groups engage in different illicit activities. Organized crime in Mali funds most armed groups \u2013 either through direct involvement, taxation or protection rackets. Human smuggling in Mali is built around various sets of actors who have overlapping webs of criminal relationships. In many cases, human trafficking networks in the north are integrated with drug-trafficking and politico-military groups. There is ongoing tension between armed groups and trafficking networks because their interests are not exactly aligned. Clashes over criminal economies often form the basis of alliances between armed groups. ##&& The narcotics networks \u2013 which grew out of the trafficking of licit and illicit goods from Libya, Algeria and Mauritania into northern Mali \u2013 are controlled mostly by Arab and Tuareg groups. While other foreign nationals are involved in criminal economies in some of Mali's urban centres, they do not exert control over the entire supply chain. Foreign actors from the broader Sahel region have joined forces to dominate artisanal goldmining in northern Mali, a sector that is booming. ##&& The traditional notion of mafia-style groups does not apply to Mali\u2019s criminal networks, as these groups do not have strict hierarchies. However, there are some lower-level criminal organizations that might have mafia-style hierarchies.","text - leadership and governance":"Mali's 2012 military coup resulted in the collapse of the state and its ability to provide basic services in large swaths of the country. The Malian government continues to work with the international community to restore the state apparatus and its capacity as a service provider to the entire territory of the country. Mass civil unrest in Bamako in 2020 exacerbated the situation and led to a political crisis that is still being mediated. Misappropriation, fraud and corruption are widespread. Corruption and high levels of organized crime are strongly linked, and while improvements have been made to the country's legal framework, Mali has been slow to establish functioning formal anti-corruption bodies. Organized crime remains a taboo topic within the ongoing peace process. ##&& Mali has ratified a number of international treaties on organized crime. However, its role in the international cooperation framework is first and foremost that of a recipient country. Mali has received widespread support and funding from the international community \u2013 and while international legal frameworks have been put in place to fight organized crime in the country, most of them are poorly executed. On a domestic level, Malian laws do not formally define organized crime, but rather fall back on offences relating to the participation in criminal associations or terrorist groups. Active and passive corruption in the private and public sectors are both offences under the country's penal code. However, there is an extensive gap between the legal engagement and application of these laws.","text - criminal justice and security":"The Malian judicial system is severely lacking. In 2018, insecurity in northern and central parts of the country led many judicial personnel to abandon their positions in these regions. Corruption presents a major challenge \u2013 and despite the country having two oversight bodies to address this, corruption remains widespread. Legal action is rarely taken when it comes to organized crime. Similarly, Mali\u2019s security forces are undermined by corrupt networks, some of which are linked to organized crime. Mali\u2019s internal security apparatus struggles with a lack of resources, low pay and inadequate training. Law enforcement capacity, which has always been limited in the northern region, is now also barely present in much of central Mali. As a result, Mali\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty are lacking \u2013 large parts of the country are not under the control of the government and still experience high levels of violence.","text - economic and financial environment":"Mali\u2019s economic regulatory environment is relatively poor, with trafficking and smuggling closely embedded in its social and economic structure. Illegal proceeds come largely from the smuggling of legal goods, as well as illicit commodities such as people, weapons and drugs across the Algerian, Nigerien and Mauritanian borders. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and their allies, as well as armed groups aligned with the Islamic State all operate in the north of the country, where they generate funds through smuggling and kidnapping for ransom. A large portion of Mali\u2019s economy is cash based, making it difficult to track illicit financial flows. Mali is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which has created anti-money laundering and combating-the-financing-of-terrorism frameworks for the region.","text - civil society and social protection":"Mali does not have a witness-protection programme.

Most of these service providers are NGOs who are funded by private and international donors. With regard to the prevention of organized crime and terrorism, the Malian government is supported by the UN\u2019s intelligence-analysis and peacekeeping units. ##&& There are active networks of civil society organizations in Mali. These groups contribute to the country\u2019s relatively open political culture and consult regularly with the government on its security strategies and policies. However, their efforts are hampered by increasing insecurity in central Mali and even in parts of southern Mali. From a regional perspective, Mali has a reputation for having a relatively free press.

Mauritanian women are also victims of trafficking in the Gulf countries, where they are subjected to sexual slavery and forced domestic service. While modern slavery is widespread across the country, members of the Haratine ethnic minority group are particularly affected. ##&& Mauritania is a transit country for migrants \u2013 mainly from Mali, Senegal and Guinea \u2013 who are smuggled into Europe, though less so than other Sahel-Saharan states. The government has an effective border-control system to prevent human smuggling. Despite this, the number of departures from Mauritania\u2019s northern coastal area towards the Spanish Canary Islands is on the rise, with many ship wrecks being reported in 2019. The Mauritanian government monitors internal movement as a means of controlling its borders, which makes mobility for irregular migrants more difficult than in other countries in the region. Nevertheless, occasional departures from Mauritania along previously closed routes have been reported in recent years. The country has also become a key entry point for Syrian refugees arriving in Africa.","text - trade":"Conflict zones and radical groups operating in the Maghreb and Sahel have resulted in all states in the region, including Mauritania, being vulnerable to the trafficking of arms. However, the market is not as prevalent as in other states in the region. In Mauritania, most small arms and light weapons are stolen or bought illegally from civilians and security forces. Arms trafficking is most prevalent along the Western Sahara border, where it flows in both directions. It also takes place along the Mauritania-Mali border, especially in the province of Hodh Ech Chargui. A small black market for arms exists in the capital, Nouakchott, which is experiencing a rise in petty crime.","text - environment":"Due to the ecology and geography of the region, the trafficking of illegal flora is largely absent in Mauritania. There is also no real evidence of poaching, due in part to a lack of commonly poached and profitable wildlife. There is poaching of small game, but only for the purposes of food and minor economic gain. However, illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing may soon become a problem. Senegalese boats often cross into Mauritania's territorial waters to fish because stocks in Senegalese waters have been depleted. Most unregulated fishing in Mauritania is perpetrated by Chinese, Turkish and European boats. There are reports of government corruption facilitating IUU fishing practices. Violence often occurs between the Mauritanian coast guard and Senegalese fishermen just off the south coast of Mauritania in the Senegalese region of St Louis. ##&& Mauritania is a producer of gold, oil and iron ore. While the smuggling of these minerals is not widely reported, a criminal market for these non-renewable resources may exist. Smuggled petrol is usually intercepted on the Algerian side of the Mauritania-Algeria border.","text - drugs":"Mauritania is a transit point for the smuggling of cannabis, which reportedly enters the country from Morocco and is destined for the Arabian Gulf. Cannabis remains a significant problem for Mauritania, despite strict sanctions regarding its use, possession and cultivation. Seizures of large quantities have occurred recently, with large drug convoys entering from southern Morocco, as well as via El Guerguerat. ##&& Mauritania also operates as a transit point for cocaine from South America that is destined for Europe. It was a key transit point from 2007\u20132008, but seizures have declined substantially since then, which could suggest reduced cocaine flows passing through the country. Most of the cocaine coming into Mauritania originates from Guinea and Guinea-Bissau. It is trafficked south by land along different desert routes towards Mali. There is little information on the domestic use of cocaine. ##&& Mauritania is a potential transit point for heroin coming from the Middle East to Europe. However, seizures of the drug are unreported, and Mauritania is probably too inconvenient as a trafficking route, given the presence of other transit hubs such as Nigeria. Research suggests there is very little domestic trade in or consumption of heroin. Similarly, there is very little evidence to suggest that there is any significant trade in synthetic drugs in Mauritania \u2013 although given the prevalence of the market in the region, it is unlikely that it is completely absent. ","text - criminal actors":"Smuggling networks are active in Mauritania, especially in the case of cannabis, pharmaceuticals and cigarettes. Smuggling takes place cross-country and along the Algerian and Moroccan borders, mostly by Mauritanian nationals. Traffickers often utilize family networks and tribal ties to facilitate smuggling.

Moroccan kif and hashish smugglers use a route that bisects the extreme east and north of the country; Sahrawi smugglers are active in the north; and there is a mix of West African networks in the south. Malian drug traffickers are active at the Mali-Mauritania border and have relationships with a coalition of terrorist groups in northern Mali. These criminal actors are regularly pursued by Mauritanian authorities, resulting in clashes with the country\u2019s security forces.","text - leadership and governance":"A history of coups has undermined the stability of Mauritania's government, which can best be described as authoritarian and repressive. While it has worked with other countries to try and prevent organized crime \u2013 as well as taken a firm stance against the trafficking of illicit goods, especially when linked to terrorist organizations \u2013 state collusion with criminal actors appears to be common practice, and there is unwillingness on the part of high-ranking officials to uphold the rule of law when it threatens their interests or those of their associates. The government has targeted and imprisoned prominent anti-corruption activists, further underscoring its lack of transparency and accountability. ##&& Mauritania has ratified a number of international treaties on organized crime. Its bilateral cooperation with the US is extensive, but there are no extradition agreements in place between the two countries. The G5 Sahel headquarters is located in Mauritania \u2013 however, its June 2020 summit did little to reinvigorate levels of international cooperation on the fight against organized crime. Regional cooperation, in particular with the Economic Community of West African States, is not well established, information sharing is poor, and there is a considerable degree of distrust between military officials of the respective states. On a domestic level, Mauritania has a number of laws related to organized crime, but none of them focus solely on the issue.","text - criminal justice and security":"Mauritania's judicial system lacks a division that deals specifically with organized crime; and it is compromised due to the influence the government exerts over it.

The police service lacks personnel, and suffers from corruption and high politicization. Law-enforcement officials are believed to be facilitators of organized-crime activities, although some notable arrests and seizures have been made with the help of foreign agencies. ##&& International cooperation has contributed to an increase in Mauritania's territorial integrity. However, most measures are implemented through the lens of counter terrorism, rather than against organized crime. In spite of involving the military in its border-control measures and enhancing its security at key transit points, Mauritania's long borders are porous due to its geography, with most of the country consisting of sparsely inhabited desert areas.

The country is reportedly a transit point for the trafficking of large megafauna from Southern Africa. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a problem because Mauritius is reliant on the industry for local consumption as well as for export purposes. Mauritius has relatively few cases of non-renewable-resource crimes, most of which are limited to the trafficking of precious stones.

Mauritius is a destination country for heroin, with one of the highest consumption rates of the drug in the region. As heroin flows from Afghanistan continues to travel down the east and southern coast of Africa, domestic heroin markets have become deeply entrenched in Mauritius, as well as in other island states in the western Indian Ocean. The use of synthetic drugs, primarily synthetic cannabinoids, known as \u2018chimique\u2019, is also high and growing, due to their affordability and easy availability. These drugs are trafficked into Mauritius predominantly for the local market rather than for further transit, and almost all synthetic cannabinoids sold on the Mauritian market are trafficked into the country from China.

Cannabis is the most popular drug in the country, but its use is illegal and carries severe punishment. While Mauritius is not a major global producer of cannabis, most seizures to date have been of locally cultivated products \u2013 and recent reports suggest that Mauritius appears to be turning into more of a destination market. Law enforcement efforts targeting cannabis cultivation have caused the price of cannabis to increase significantly over the past five years, which is thought to be one driver of the shift toward synthetic drug use in the country. Mauritius does not have a significant cocaine market. The drug is trafficked into the country from West Africa and then onto East Asian and Middle Eastern markets, largely by sea. Local usage is limited mostly to expats, the social elite and those who have studied in Europe. ","text - criminal actors":"State-embedded criminal actors are active in Mauritius, with a commission of inquiry linking state officials \u2013 including politicians and law-enforcement personnel \u2013 to drug traffickers. The minister of gender equality and the deputy speaker stepped down in 2018 following allegations of their involvement in drug trafficking and money laundering. Middle- to lower-level state actors are involved in all criminal markets, as are corrupt senior officials. ##&& Criminal networks operating in country are made up mostly of Mauritian nationals, who work with suppliers based predominantly in South Africa, East Africa and Madagascar. These networks are generally not violent, but levels of corruption in law enforcement remain high. The emergence of synthetic drugs in Mauritius in 2015 prompted a dramatic increase in the number of drug-trafficking networks operating in the country. Because synthetics can be ordered online, these new networks are less reliant on overseas suppliers and have a less hierarchical structure than is the case in the heroin trade. ##&& Research indicates that foreign criminal actors are involved in Mauritius, particularly in drug trafficking. Members of a community of Nigerian students have been arrested in recent years with large quantities of heroin. Bangladesh and Indian workers have also been arrested for engaging in drug trafficking, but human trafficking appears to be primarily the domain of local actors. There are certain gangs in Mauritius that resemble mafia-style groups, their level of power, organization and sophistication remains very low, although with the potential to develop into more influential actors in the future.","text - leadership and governance":"Mauritius is reportedly the only country in Africa to meet the requirements of a full democracy. However, the government\u2019s credibility has been undermined by recent financial, corruption and collusion scandals, which culminated in the president stepping down in 2018. State involvement in drug trafficking is hard to gauge, but drug money is rumoured to have infiltrated political and electoral financing. The enrichment of the political elite and nepotism are both problems that need attention, and the integrity of some government officials has been questioned due to scandals involving the misappropriation of funds. The prime minister has close ties to a gambling mogul who is reported to have financed his campaign during the last elections. Such links and high-profile scandals demonstrate a level of state capture by criminal interests. In spite of these issues, Mauritius is regarded as a highly stable state and a leading example for Africa. ##&& Mauritius has signed a number of international treaties on organized crime, and is a party to the Palermo Convention, Rome Statute and Sua Act. It has signed an extradition treaty with the US and ratified the SADC protocol on extradition as well as other international anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism pacts. Mauritius has entered into bilateral and multilateral agreements with other countries and has strong relationships with Madagascar and nearby South Asian countries, especially India, with which it shares military training and intelligence. While its legislation is generally strong, in 2020 Mauritius was placed on the European Union\u2019s blacklist for high-risk countries in terms of its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist-financing frameworks. Its anti-human trafficking and child protection acts work well in tandem, but there are nonetheless still weaknesses in the system \u2013 such as restrictions on victims\u2019 freedom of movement and the length of time it takes to complete a civil suit. Although there are strategies in place against drug trafficking, there is no clear national strategy against organized crime in Mauritius.","text - criminal justice and security":"Mauritius\u2019s judiciary is considered to be independent. Although there are no specialized departments within the judiciary to counter organized crime, the authorities have prosecuted a number of cases successfully, particularly with regard to drug and human trafficking. Prison conditions can sometimes be poor \u2013 and according to the latest available data, close to half of the country\u2019s prison population is in pre-trial detention or remand imprisonment. ##&& There are a number of specialized units within Mauritius\u2019s police service, such as the Central Criminal Investigation Department (CCID) and an anti-drug smuggling unit. The national police force is generally regarded as well trained and reasonably efficient, and is well supported by foreign governments. The CCID is perceived as a so-called political unit that reacts promptly if allegations are levelled against the prime minister. While there is a commonly held sense that Mauritius\u2019s fight against drugs has been largely cosmetic, this is attributed mainly to widespread corruption and incompetence in its law-enforcement bodies rather than to direct political collusion in the drug trade. ##&& Subpar checks at Mauritius\u2019s airports mean it is relatively easy to bring drugs into the country via its air routes. And with its multiple islands and lack of maritime security, Mauritius struggles to police its borders, while under-resourcing and poor training facilitate corruption in the national coastguard. However, because the country is sea-locked with few ports, it is difficult for criminal networks to smuggle contraband into the country via sea routes. In spite of this, there have been some incidents of smuggling through Mauritian ports, allegedly involving a degree of state-embedded protection. ","text - economic and financial environment":"Mauritius has made significant improvements to its anti-money laundering laws to prevent abuse of its global business and financial sectors. However, being placed on the EU\u2019s blacklist in 2020 is likely to have hugely negative consequences for the country\u2019s economy. Among the risks which prompted this move were a lack of risk-based supervision of the global business sector, a failure to demonstrate that law enforcement has the capacity to conduct money laundering investigations, and opacity surrounding beneficial ownership. ##&& Conversely, Mauritius' economy is one of the strongest and freest in Africa, and in 2020 the World Bank classified Mauritius as a high-income country. Recent reforms aimed at facilitating entrepreneurship have been successful and have stimulated an already solid economy. As a result, the incentive to engage in criminal activity is lower than in other parts of Africa.","text - civil society and social protection":"Mauritius has a fairly robust framework for supporting victims of organized crime, especially human trafficking. However, victims of drug trafficking are still often processed as criminals rather than victims, and improvements need to be made in providing them with adequate care. Treatment for drug users is funded by the government, with further support coming from non-profit organizations. There is no formal witness protection programme in place in Mauritius, and positive steps have been taken to counter most criminal markets; however, resources and implementation capacity are limited. Arrests of human traffickers have increased, alongside drug-trafficking arrests, which have grown significantly since 2018. There are various prevention strategies in place within law enforcement, including community-oriented policing \u2013 and every year, Mauritius participates in Cutlass Express, a multinational operation sponsored by the US Africa Command, to facilitate cooperation and collaborative activities to prevent maritime crime in the region. ##&& Civil society is strong in Mauritius and supported by the government. It has good engagement in social, economic and cultural spheres and benefits from EU funding. However, the government has been accused of undermining media freedom by banning certain journalists from press conferences, delivering licenses to government-friendly media companies only, and using its state-run television station to undermine protests. On the whole, the media environment is relatively fair, but journalists have been imprisoned and stories on corruption in the tourism sector are almost entirely censored.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Port Louis","GDP (current $US million)":"14048.43","Income group":"High income","Population":"1265711","Land Area (sq. km)":"2040","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"38.1","Freedom in the World Index":"87","Human Development Index":"0.8","Global Peace Index":"1.54","Democracy Index":"8.14","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"53","GDP per capita (current US$)":"11099","1":"4.52","1.1":"4.40","1.2":"4.63","2":"5.67"},{"Corresp":"118","ISO-3":"MAR","Country":"Morocco","ISO-2":"MA","Continent":"Africa","Region":"North Africa","Flag file":"ma.png","1.

Traffickers include Moroccan and foreign nationals who belong to sub-Saharan networks. ##&& Morocco is a transit and source country for migrant smuggling, with both foreign actors and Moroccans involved in human-smuggling operations. In 2018, the Moroccan route became the most important entry point to Europe. Rising levels of human smuggling have contributed to local insecurity, with migrants being recruited into the informal and criminal economies.

Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is another problem, with quotas and off-season fishing bans being violated frequently, while the trafficking of eels destined for Spanish and Asian markets is also prevalent. ##&& In terms of non-renewable-resource crimes, Morocco was once a fairly large exporter of gold to the United Arab Emirates, but this seems to have declined recently. Oil is still smuggled from Algeria to Morocco's border regions. However, the trafficking and illicit sale of petrol, which previously involved large numbers of unemployed individuals in north-eastern Morocco, has declined sharply since 2015.","text - drugs":"Morocco is one of the most important producers of cannabis in the world, with production concentrated in the Rif region, and trade traditionally centred in Chefchaouen and Ketama. While there is significant local consumption throughout the territory, Moroccan cannabis is also widely distributed across the entire wider region, as well as to European markets. Domestic cannabis cultivation and production are large contributors to the Moroccan economy, and although the tail end of 2020 saw an increased debate surrounding the potential legalization of cannabis, the illicit market as a whole has remained stable in recent years. ##&& There are regular reports of the increasing availability and consumption of heroin in northern Morocco, particularly in Nador and Tangier. Extensive drug trafficking takes place between Morocco and Spain, including of Afghan heroin that is shipped to Morocco before heading for European markets. Morocco is a key trans-shipment point for South American cocaine on its way into European markets, with large volumes of the drug being moved through Morocco via its sea and air routes. While there is a limited local market \u2013 consisting mainly of the national elite, expats and tourists \u2013 cocaine trafficking through Morocco is increasing and the country is home to the first cocaine-processing lab in Africa. There have been reports of the widespread availability of Ecstasy in Morocco, as well as of crystal methamphetamine and Karkoubi consumption. Psychotropic drugs are apparently becoming increasingly prevalent. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns are likely to have slowed down imports, at least temporarily, of synthetic drugs, heroin and cocaine.","text - criminal actors":"The so-called Moroccan mafia is made up of many criminal networks whose members are Moroccan or of Moroccan descent. These networks are active in the country as well as abroad, particularly in the Netherlands and Belgium. They are composed of several gangs and are involved mainly in cannabis trafficking between Morocco and Europe. Despite their name, these groups do not have the characteristics of a mafia-style organization (there is no evidence to suggest that mafia-style groups exist in the country), but function rather as criminal networks involved in common crimes. These networks are highly flexible and tend to diversify their smuggling activities, especially at Morocco's borders with its North African neighbours, despite an enhanced police presence in these areas. ##&& Foreign criminal networks made up of Latin American drug trafficking organizations and Italian organized crime groups are also active in Morocco, although the degree of their activities is limited and their impact is minimal. Nevertheless, they do have strong ties with domestic criminal networks in Morocco. There is low-level corruption among law enforcement officers and services that protect trafficking networks. High-level officials in the security forces, military and government are involved in Morocco's organized crime markets. In particular, drug trafficking networks are believed to have connections in Morocco's highest political and administrative circles.","text - leadership and governance":"Political interests and influence prevent the Moroccan authorities from truly transforming their efforts to tackle organized crime. The government's decision to emphasize stability over the rule of law has enabled the human trafficking, human smuggling and petrol smuggling markets to proliferate. However, the interior minister and other state officials have attempted to introduce changes aimed at cannabis use. Political debates often centre on the issue of cannabis, and many in the political sphere advocate for the drug's legalization. The government has also made important strides in combating the illicit-arms trade. In spite of this, there is a notable lack of transparency in matters related to royal interests, and the accountability of law enforcement and military personnel is minimal. The chronic corruption witnessed in Morocco was further highlighted amid the COVID-19 pandemic as the government awarded public contracts with very little transparency or oversight. Overall, the Moroccan government, despite the rhetoric, has done little to combat corruption and improve transparency and accountability. ##&& Morocco has ratified a number of international treaties and conventions on organized crime. It has also engaged in effective international cooperation efforts, particularly with regard to intelligence sharing. The country is open to receiving international assistance, but there are issues related to extradition. On a domestic level, Morocco has strong anti-organized crime legislation and a legal framework based on civil law. However, it is the implementation of the legal framework that is lacking. Moreover, the country does not have a clear national strategy against organized crime.","text - criminal justice and security":"Although the constitutional reform of 2011 officially granted the judicial system a greater degree of independence, in practice the degree of independence of the judiciary in Morocco is low and the country\u2019s courts are often used to target opposition voices. While the court system experienced disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020, prosecutions of various forms of organized crime did take place, although with regard to human trafficking judicial proceedings, prosecutors often fail to correctly distinguish between trafficking and smuggling. Prisons in Morocco are overcrowded and human rights abuses of those detained in the country\u2019s prison system are regularly reported. The country\u2019s law enforcement agency has recently created special investigative units, which are well equipped but limited in their overall capacity, especially in rural areas. Cooperation between Morocco's security forces could be improved. With regard to its territorial integrity, extensive smuggling, facilitated by corruption, takes place through Morocco's ports.","text - economic and financial environment":"Morocco has a relatively strong economy for the region, but economic disparities exist within the country.

However, it has now set up a financial-intelligence processing unit to tackle money laundering and the financing of terrorism, which has helped the authorities uphold international anti-money laundering standards. At the end of 2020, a revised version of the criminal code related to money laundering was being drafted in Parliament to strengthen sanctions.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victims of human trafficking do not receive adequate treatment and protection in Morocco, and the country has very few measures in place to help them exit from modern-day slavery.

However, there has been a notable crackdown on civil society, and in particular on journalists, by the authorities in recent years. Media organizations are subjected to significant external pressure, and investigative journalism remains rare. Many professional journalists, as well as citizen journalists, have been imprisoned.

As a result, many of these weapons have made their way into South Africa, where the demand is higher.","text - environment":"Mozambique has a substantial market for illegal logging, which has resulted in extensive deforestation across the country. The driving force behind illegal logging, as in other African countries, is China's high demand for timber. All actors in the illegal logging industry operate with almost complete impunity and there are allegations of collusion between criminal networks and government officials, who facilitate the shipment of illicit wood out of the country by issuing false licenses and authorizations. With over two-thirds of Mozambique's population being dependent on smallholder farming, the long-term environmental impact of illicit logging makes the country especially vulnerable. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is prevalent off the coast of Mozambique. The country is also one of the principal suppliers of ivory and rhino horn to Asia. Political protection for southern poachers is provided by mid- to high-level state officials. There has been a distinct reduction in horn-smuggling seizures, possibly due to the severe decrease in global mobility in 2020 and the crackdown on the wildlife trade in China in the wake of COVID-19. ##&& Mozambique has an active market for non-renewable-resource crimes. Mining operations in the country generally lack transparency, with most profitable mining concessions being owned by those with powerful political connections. Mozambique is a transit country for smuggled Zimbabwean diamonds and illicit gold from South Africa that is on its way to the United Arab Emirates, while Maputo\u2019s port and airport are also used in the smuggling of precious stones from South Africa to Asia. The South African police suspect the involvement of some of Mozambique's political elite in this trade.","text - drugs":"Mozambique is an integral part of a major heroin transit route, which is operated by a tightly regulated network of families that is believed to be backed by the political class in the country. The heroin market is almost entirely under the control of the state, which explains the low levels of violence associated with the heroin trade in Mozambique. The insurgency in Cabo Delgado has created greater challenges for heroin importers, but in spite of this, northern Mozambique has emerged as a major landing point for Afghan heroin. From here, it goes to other parts of Africa, as well as to Europe. There is a growing domestic market for heroin in the coastal Indian Ocean states and seizures have reportedly increased. Mozambique is a destination and transit country for cocaine. It is understood that small shipments arrive by air and overland routes, while larger shipments arrive by sea. There is speculation that because of international clampdowns on West African transit routes, countries like Mozambique have emerged as attractive alternatives. ##&& Mozambique is a significant trans-shipment point for cannabis in the region. The country also has a domestic cannabis-production and consumption market, but it is relatively informal. While the production and use of synthetic drugs in the country is limited, there is evidence of Mozambican criminal actors trying to get involved in South Africa\u2019s methamphetamine market.

The trafficking of synthetic drugs tends to overlap with wildlife and human trafficking.","text - criminal actors":"Evidence shows that some state-embedded actors own legal ruby companies in Mozambique that are involved in tax evasion, as well as in taking advantage of local populations. They are also complicit in a number of illicit economies. There is virtual impunity for high-ranking politicians involved in criminal markets. Moreover, the police are described as the closest thing to a mafia group in the country, with law-enforcement officers often engaged directly in organized-crime activities and used as a hit squad by the government and ruling party. Foreign criminal actors are known to operate in Mozambique \u2013 for example, Chinese criminal actors play a significant role in the country's illicit timber industry as well as in illicit mining, ivory trafficking and illegal fishing. Tanzanian criminal groups are involved in the illegal ivory trade, while Somali nationals drive human smuggling operations and Thai networks have a stake in the smuggling of rubies. Vietnamese groups are reportedly involved in the illegal rhino trade and the local heroin market is linked to Pakistani organized crime networks. ##&& There are many local criminal networks in Mozambique, including powerful families who exercise control over some of the country's ports and have a strong presence in the biggest cities in the northern parts of the country. These groups have established tight relationships with Mozambique's political elite as well as international links to the Pakistani market for heroin.

There is very little transparency in Mozambique and the government has not implemented any oversight mechanisms. The hidden-debts scandal prompted the government to tighten up on transparency and accountability, but the result has been an increase in red tape that has not had any significant effect on hampering corruption. ##&& Mozambique engages in international cooperation to a limited degree and has ratified a number of treaties on organized crime.

The market for exotic hardwood is one of the largest illegal enterprises in the country and runs parallel to the legal markets for timber and charcoal. Walvis Bay is a transit point for other African wood destined for Asia, including timber from Mozambique and Angola. ##&& Namibia has a large market for ivory, rhino horn and pangolins. Since 2016 it has lost an average of 50 rhinos a year to poaching. Although it draws less attention than other wildlife species, the poaching of hippos is prevalent in Namibia. Illicit fauna products take the same route as wood, and are often hidden among illegal stacks of timber on smuggling missions.

While the majority of poachers in the country are Namibians, foreign citizens from countries such as Zimbabwe and Angola are also involved. Illegal fishing also takes place in Namibian waters, primarily by foreign vessels. Overall, however, the illegal trade in animal species is thought to have decreased in recent years, and a decline in the volume of seizures appears to support this. ##&& Namibia has a considerable market for illicit diamonds and gemstones.

This is because the country's geography and Debmarine Namibia\u2019s control of large-scale mining make smuggling and illegal extraction difficult. ","text - drugs":"Namibia is emerging as a trans-shipment point for Afghan heroin, which enters the country overland from the south. From Namibia, it either continues into West Africa or is shipped to destination markets in Europe. Domestic consumption is growing, especially of adulterated and cheaper versions of the drug. Nevertheless, no foreign organized crime groups have succeeded in establishing a foothold in the heroin market, its seizures rates are lower than for other drugs and overall, the heroin market in Namibia is fairly limited. Namibia\u2019s involvement in the cocaine trade has grown, both in terms of its domestic consumption and its role as a transit country. Namibia is a minor trans-shipment point for cocaine coming from South America, with onward shipping to South Africa. Namibian nationals have been arrested for their role in the cocaine industry, where they operate alongside foreign actors, most commonly Angolans and Congolese. Seizures are becoming relatively common, with US$72 000 worth of cocaine being seized on a flight from Johannesburg in 2020. ##&& Namibia is not a noteworthy transit hub for cannabis, which is the most-seized drug in the country. According to the Namibian police, for example, 316 297 kilograms of cannabis worth US$214 000 was seized in May 2020. Most cannabis that is seized is intended for local consumption. Any cannabis that makes its way into the country comes predominantly from eSwatini. Criminal convictions are mainly for distribution and possession. The availability of synthetic drugs is growing, particularly in urban and tourist centres. It is dependent on cross-border supplies from South Africa. Mandrax is commonly seized by officials. Synthetic-drug use is likely to have increased during the COVID-19 liquor ban. However, the incidence of synthetic-opioid use is marginal, as pharmacies and medical doctors are well regulated and law-enforcement agencies have a strong grip on distribution networks.","text - criminal actors":"There is little evidence of mafia-style groups in Namibia except for the Numbers gangs, who are active in prisons. While they have some links to outside street gangs, their reach is either limited or not well documented. Criminal networks are well established and work across all the main illicit markets, especially wildlife crimes and human trafficking. Syndicates smuggling hardwood to Eastern Asia appear to be particularly well organized, operating on an industrial scale and using Namibia as a transit hub. ##&& There are state-embedded actors in Namibia who facilitate the work of criminal networks. The Fishrot saga of 2019 is an example of corruption at a high level of government, and other corruption scandals have emerged in recent years, including in 2020, involving government ministers. Corrupt practices are also commonplace, however, at lower levels of the state apparatus. Lower-level border-control officials are complicit in cross-border smuggling, while local politicians in port towns have been involved in the smuggling of contraband. ##&& Foreign criminal actors in Namibia include South African gangs who traffic synthetic drugs into Namibia and Chinese nationals who export exotic hardwood to Asia. These groups sometimes work hand in hand with corrupt state actors and mask their activities by setting up legitimate businesses in strategic ports such as Walvis Bay. There are also Angolan, Zambian and Congolese groups involved in Namibia's drug- and human-trafficking markets.","text - leadership and governance":"The Namibian government enjoys a relatively high level of legitimacy in the country; however, they have not used this to articulate a stance against organized crime. President Geinob has publicly announced that corruption is not a major issue in the country, in spite of evidence to the contrary \u2013 including the Fishrot saga, in which government officials irregularly sold fishing rights to an Icelandic corporation. The government has taken strides in addressing human-trafficking and fauna crimes, but issues remain in other markets \u2013 in particular, the hardwood trade. The government\u2019s decision to temporarily ban liquor during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increase in the smuggling and use of drugs. ##&& Namibia is considered to be a flawed democracy, and the general population is becoming increasingly dissatisfied about socioeconomic issues related to corruption. The Namibian anti-corruption agency is generally weak, lacking both political will and the resources to investigate crimes. Namibian electorates showed their disapproval of the ruling party\u2019s performance in government during the 2020 municipal and regional elections, with survey respondents citing corruption as the primary reason for voting against the ruling party. Most government institutions are unresponsive to requests for data and information. Political dissent is grudgingly tolerated by the presidency, but it is often criticised. ##&& Namibia is a signatory to most major international treaties on organized crime, and it automatically enshrines ratified treaties into national legislation. However, it has not ratified the firearms protocol of the UNTOC. Coordinated efforts with neighbouring governments, particularly Angola, have helped combat human and wildlife trafficking. A joint operation by US law enforcement and the Namibian police in 2020 succeeded in apprehending four people attempting to traffic pangolins. The country has also signed an agreement with South Africa to tackle the issue of illegal fishing. Namibia maintains a good relationship with the UNODC, and has an active relationship with the Australian Transaction Reports Analysis Centre, which it assists in its efforts against money laundering. It has also signed the Southern African Development Community's protocols on extradition and corruption. ##&& Namibia's Prevention of Organized Crime Act is its primary legislation against organized-crime activities. The Trafficking in Persons Act was finalised and brought into force in November 2019. The Anti-Corruption Commission has achieved some success, in spite of the legislation failing to define corruption properly. The Nature Conservation General Amendment Act combats the killing of animals, but it does not adequately address the trafficking of parts. The country's minerals policy is inadequate and ineffective.","text - criminal justice and security":"Namibia's judiciary is considered independent and its ethical codes of conduct are in line with the Bangalore Principles. The former minister of education was convicted of corruption in 2019, and a number of significant cases against wildlife crimes, human trafficking and corruption are ongoing. Nevertheless, there is negative public perception of Namibia's judges \u2013 and its justice system is seen as dysfunctional, under-resourced and burdened by backlogs. Corruption cases against state officials are often delayed, and many citizens face barriers to accessing justice. Prison conditions are substandard, and the Numbers gangs allegedly have a large degree of control over prison life. Namibia's law enforcement is hampered by inadequate training, skills shortages, a lack of resources and corruption. Mistreatment of citizens by the police has been reported. However, the number of arrests relating to wildlife, human-trafficking and financial crimes appears to be increasing. Namibian law-enforcement's cooperation with other jurisdictions, including the US and Rwanda, appears to be yielding good results, such as the arresting of pangolin poachers and the training of officials. ##&& Namibia's border controls remain weak and the country\u2019s borders are porous. Fencing is often absent, especially along the Angolan and Zambian borders, across which illicit fuel and liquor were often smuggled during the COVID-19 lockdowns. In spite of the lack of fencing, many smugglers still prefer to send their illegal products through Namibia's official border posts because of the convenience of travelling via established routes. The country is a hub for the illicit transporting and exporting of forest products, especially hardwood, via ports such as Walvis Bay. The trafficking of drugs into and through Namibia appears to be increasing, with border officials complicit in these operations.","text - economic and financial environment":"Namibia has comprehensive legislation in place in the form of its Financial Intelligence Act. However, once a case has been brought to court, a dysfunctional and under-resourced judiciary hampers prosecutions. While research indicates that the country has made good progress with regard to combating money laundering, it still remains a substantial problem. The Fishrot scandal exposed Namibia\u2019s susceptibility to corruption \u2013 especially given that it came to light through leaked documents rather than intelligence operations, suggesting that the country's law enforcement agencies do not have the capacity to implement its financial laws. The scandal also damaged Namibia\u2019s reputation by indicating that well-connected criminal actors are not subject to the rule of law in a business environment. ##&& While Namibia's economic regulatory framework is adequate, growth remains slow, due mainly to an overdependence on government subsidies in key areas of the economy. The uneven distribution of income makes illicit activity attractive to poorer parts of the population. Property rights are constitutionally guaranteed but seem to be under increasing threat as movements are made towards land expropriation.","text - civil society and social protection":"Namibia's victim- and witness-support programmes are insubstantial. The country meets only a third of the mechanisms that have been identified to help victims exit modern slavery. While various ministries and NGOs work in tandem to provide support to the victims of human trafficking, shelters and other facilities are under-staffed and under-resourced. Namibia has had some success in crime prevention related to elephant and rhino poaching in recent years. However, no major successes have been reported in other areas and criminal activities continue largely unabated. ##&& Namibia hosts a large number of active civil society groups, but they are in decline due to a lack of funding. The country has one of the freest media environments in Africa, with protection of the press enshrined in its constitution and often defended by the courts. However, the government has begun to crack down on the media, with pro-government media houses receiving an ever-larger chunk of state advertising revenue, while others find themselves under attack if they produce stories with an anti-corruption stance.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Windhoek","GDP (current $US million)":"12366.53","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"2494530","Land Area (sq. km)":"824290","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"64.3","Freedom in the World Index":"77","Human Development Index":"0.65","Global Peace Index":"1.86","Democracy Index":"6.52","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"51","GDP per capita (current US$)":"4957","1":"4.33","1.1":"3.90","1.2":"4.75","2":"4.96"},{"Corresp":"127","ISO-3":"NER","Country":"Niger","ISO-2":"NE","Continent":"Africa","Region":"West Africa","Flag file":"ne.png","1.

Traditional slavery practices continue, primarily in the north, where girls born into slavery are sold or offered as gifts, and then forced into labour and sexual servitude. People from West Africa are increasingly falling victim to trafficking while passing through the country en route to North Africa and Europe. Nigerien children are forced to beg, subjected to domestic servitude and forced labour in the country's gold, salt, trona and gypsum mines, as well as in agriculture, stone quarries and manufacturing. While some Nigerien women work in brothels en route to Europe, there are also networks that specialize in trafficking women and children for labour exploitation in West and North Africa, the Middle East and Europe, where victims are also forced into domestic work and sex trafficking, or work in the agriculture sector and animal herding. ##&& Niger's human smuggling market includes both highly organized networks and opportunistic criminal entrepreneurs. Niger \u2013 and the city of Agadez, in particular \u2013 is a crossroads for trans-Saharan caravan routes that link the Mediterranean and West Africa. Human smuggling is a financial lifeline for many local people, particularly in the north; and the challenges associated with traversing the Sahara cause many to turn to smuggling networks. Although the number of people transiting Niger has decreased, networks have shown increased degrees of sophistication and adaptation. A high degree of corruption also facilitates operations, which have been disrupted by COVID-19 restrictions.","text - trade":"Niger is a major transit corridor for weapons destined for conflict zones in the region. The deterioration of Niger's own security and stability however has made it increasingly a destination market for arms, while illegal gold mining has also generated a market for illicit explosives. Weapons include munitions from past conflicts, diversions from government stockpiles, and those smuggled from other countries in the region. Terrorists use a range of trafficked weapons including explosives, small arms, machine guns and mortar rounds, as well as armed vehicles. ##&& Conflict in the Tillab\u00e9ri region continues, while armed Toubou groups based in southern Libya prey on illicit economies in northern Niger. The Islamic State in West Africa poses a substantial threat to Niger's border region with Nigeria, and armed groups operating in Nigeria's Zamfara forests, which border Niger\u2019s Maradi region, have become increasingly violent. ","text - environment":"Unregulated logging has long been a problem due to the traditional use of biomass as cooking fuel. With regards to wildlife crimes, gangs of Nigerien poachers visit the W National Park in search of skins, meat and by-products from animals including buffalo, antelope, elephants, snakes, monkeys and big cats. Vultures are also killed illegally. Since 2018, there have been no traditional forest rangers in the park. Niger has been successful in halting the poaching of its West African giraffes, but the Kour\u00e9 giraffe reserve may once again become vulnerable due to a lack of conservation funding following a targeted terrorist attack in August 2020 and the subsequent end to tourism in the area. ##&& Niger is a source country for gold, and artisanal gold mining is widespread. Thousands of artisanal miners work in the Tchibarakaten and Tillab\u00e9ri regions. The industry is unregulated and few sites have technical support, security guards or tax agents. The work is dangerous because of patrolling Algerian security forces and armed bandits. Gold panning increases the risk of corruption, misrepresentation, money laundering and non-payment of taxes, as well as of forced labour (including child labour), prostitution and sexual violence. The town of Arlitis being used increasingly as a hub for illegal artisanal-gold-mining activities. Illicit flows related to the uranium and oil industries also occur in Niger, but they are not well documented.","text - drugs":"Niger is a transit country for heroin. Afghan heroin enters Niger through its southeast and southwest borders, with the cities of Agadez, Maradi, Zinder and Tahoua being key transit hubs. Niger is also a transit country for Latin-American cocaine destined for the Mediterranean coast, Europe and the Middle East. Key trafficking routes run from Mali through Niger to Libya, and are managed predominantly by armed Malian groups. There are rumours of the involvement of influential criminal actors in Niger's cocaine-trafficking market, including senior governmental officials. While the violence associated with Niger's cocaine trade is less severe than Mali's, it has seriously impacted the country's governance. Traffickers, who are afraid of being targeted by armed groups in southern Libya, have taken advantage of the reduced number of vehicles travelling across the Tenere desert since the start of COVID-19 to increase their flows. ##&& Cannabis is widely consumed in Niger. The country plays an important role as a transit point for cannabis resin, with senior government actors reportedly involved in the trade. There has been a slight increase in the quantity of trans-Sahel cannabis resin being transported through Niger. Because it is located along the west-to-east route for the trafficking of Moroccan kif, all the kif convoys coming out of Mali as well as many of those entering Libya transit Niger. ##&& The trafficking and domestic consumption of Tramadol has boomed in Niger. Lax monitoring of its pharmaceutical industry, combined with the ease of importing Tramadol from India and China, has made Niger a key gateway for the drug. Smugglers transport Tramadol from Nigeria through Niger and into Libya, where they receive a higher price for the drug. ","text - criminal actors":"Smuggling is carried out predominantly by loosely organized criminal networks. The semi nomadic, pastoral Tuareg ethnic group has long been engaged in cross-border trade of a wide range of commodities across the Sahara region. Criminal elements smuggle everything from foodstuffs to cars along Niger's border with Nigeria, using truck caravans to travel through the desert. The criminalization of migrant transport has pushed such operations underground, feeding the trafficking of drugs and weapons. Most local criminal networks are territorially based and organized into ethnic groups. Agadez\u2019s transnational smuggling networks are organized along ethnolinguistic lines and connected to larger networks. ##&& Since 2018, a large drug-trafficking network has increasingly been using Niger as a transit point between the Maghreb and Europe. Terrorism in Niger mainly takes the form of clashes between security forces and extremist militants, as well as kidnappings, but the country also faces threats from Mali- and Nigeria-based terrorist groups. Armed Malian groups have a stronghold on some smuggling routes and have been connected with key political stakeholders in Niamey. Foreign criminal actors feeding the Sahel's drug and smuggling economies include Latin-American and Asian cartels, mafia groups in the Maghreb, and mafia groups linked to African diasporas abroad. Foreign actors are also involved in the smuggling of humans and gold \u2013 and those with connections in Sudan and Dubai appear to have increasing influence. Most foreign criminal networks are loosely structured, and their key members are easily replaced. ##&& A number of violent extremist organizations act as quasi-mafia-style groups in Niger. Tramadol is sold by mafia networks made up primarily of Malian nationals. Government officials at all levels are suspected to be involvement in drug, human and gold smuggling and there have been a number of corruption and alleged embezzlement scandals in Niger in recent years.","text - leadership and governance":"Although the Nigerien government's actions are not very effective at stemming organized crime, there is clear effort, especially regarding violent extremist organizations, militias and north-bound smuggling. The number of individuals attempting to cross the Mediterranean has decreased considerably due to government measures \u2013 however, smugglers have subsequently resorted to road banditry and drug and alcohol trafficking, or joined militias in Libya. Corruption is rife and has invaded all public and private services, with the payment of bribes to officials for basic services akin to a national taxation system. The government is not considered transparent, despite establishing two anti-corruption agencies, although questions have been raised as to the degree of independence of one of these bodies. ##&& Niger has ratified international agreements related to organized crime and is party to the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption. The country is an active partner in the international community on security matters, but has low state resilience to organized crime and depends heavily on international assistance, including from the United States and its European partners. The country also has good relations with China, particularly in the uranium, oil and infrastructure sectors. Niger has incorporated many of the provisions of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime into its national legislation, but its capacity for effective implementation is limited. It has adopted domestic laws to combat human smuggling, but its anti-corruption framework is lacking and there are no effective mechanisms in place to regulate the financing of political parties or audit state spending. ","text - criminal justice and security":"The judiciary is not independent from the executive, and higher court rulings are often disregarded. Judicial corruption is fuelled by low wages and a lack of training and resources, with high-ranking politicians frequently acting with impunity. Corruption and nepotism are rampant among the lower levels of the judiciary, and decisions are often influenced by links with business. As a consequence, the judiciary functions ineffectively, and opposition leaders and civil society activists have been sentenced. Since the criminalization of smuggling, almost no members of organized crime groups have been prosecuted, while those with political connections have avoided arrest or been released before going to trial. However, Niger does have judicial-cooperation agreements with France. ##&& Although Niger's under-resourced law enforcement body is one of its most corrupt domestic institutions, the country's security forces represent a strong deterrent for crime and smuggling, due in part to their levying of hefty bribes to secure smugglers' release from jail. Despite a widespread lack of ready access to security services and high levels of perceived corruption, the police still enjoy the trust of the public. Law-enforcement capacity has increased alongside international attention on terrorism and smuggling in the region, with Niger's border forces successfully disrupting drug and arms smuggling at its border with Nigeria. Police, prosecutors and judges have received training on how to deal with human trafficking, and the government has cooperated with a regional anti-trafficking operation. ##&& Niger's land border is one of the longest in the world, and spans desert areas with little state reach. Despite considerable international investment, the country's borders remain permeable to the smuggling and trafficking of drugs, arms, cigarettes and humans, as well as to the invasion of militias and extremist groups. Kidnapping for ransom is a key fundraising activity for terrorists \u2013 and despite its new border posts and increased security training, regional conflict has made Niger an ideal transit point for illicit goods. Border-control corruption provides supplementary revenues for state agents, while terrorist organizations make money by controlling some of the trans-border trade between Nigeria and Niger, including the lucrative smoked-fish industry in the Lake Chad Basin. ","text - economic and financial environment":"While some anti-money laundering initiatives have been launched to counter terrorism, Niger's capacity for financial oversight remains weak. Its economic underdevelopment is due in part to food insecurity, a lack of industry, weak education system, increasing population, and limited employment opportunities. ##&& While the country is a member of the Central Bank of West African States, whose banking system and currency it shares, businesses are often put off from placing large amounts of funds in the system due to high transaction costs. Most economic activity is cash-based and takes place outside of the conventional banking system. Informal money- and value-transfer services are widespread. These fall outside of the state's financial regulatory framework \u2013 and as such are not subject to taxes on income or services. Niger's economy has been hurt by terrorist activity, kidnappings and instability \u2013 and the government therefore relies on foreign donors for much of its budget. Low uranium prices, the country's demographics and its high expenditure on security are likely to put continued strain on its economy. ","text - civil society and social protection":"The Agence Nationale de Luttecontre la Traite des Personnes fights trafficking and provides support to victims. However, it is largely supported by international organizations and no other form of victim support is available. There is no witness-protection programme in Niger, and victim identification, referral and protection services are inadequate. The government does not offer any dedicated services for adult victims of modern slavery or hereditary slavery. Some activities have been launched with international support to prevent radicalization and narcotics trafficking, as well as to provide training on intelligence gathering and analysis. With the exception of a few initiatives sponsored by the United Nations, civil society in Niger does not play a major role in combating organized crime. ##&& Legal protections for journalists are not always enforced, and members of the media are often harassed and arrested. Despite media offenses being decriminalized under the country's media law, journalists continue to be tried criminally. The arrests of journalists, the closure of media outlets and the obstruction of journalistic activities have plagued the country in recent years. During government elections, social media access and texting was temporarily blocked. State-run and private newspapers and radio stations compete with one another. News access throughout the country comes primarily from radio, where state broadcasters dominate. The authorities and certain international organizations are responsible for restrictions on the release of information, but official censorship is not common. Instead, self-censorship is practised and stems in part from political pressure or advertising incentives to influence content.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Niamey","GDP (current $US million)":"12911.69","Income group":"Low income","Population":"23310715","Land Area (sq. km)":"1267000","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"96","Freedom in the World Index":"48","Human Development Index":"0.39","Global Peace Index":"2.61","Democracy Index":"3.29","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"32","GDP per capita (current US$)":"554","1":"6.02","1.1":"5.90","1.2":"6.13","2":"3.21"},{"Corresp":"128","ISO-3":"NGA","Country":"Nigeria","ISO-2":"NG","Continent":"Africa","Region":"West Africa","Flag file":"ng.png","1.

Other forms of human trafficking in Nigeria include increasingly prevalent \u2018baby factories\u2019, the recruitment of women and girls for prostitution and widespread forced domestic servitude. Hausa networks operating in the north are involved in transnational sexual and labour trafficking to Arab countries, particularly Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the military has been known to informally recruit underage boys as vigilantes, a practice also common among non-state armed groups using child soldiers. ##&& Human smuggling is less pervasive than trafficking, as free movement under the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) protocol has moderated the need for intra-regional smuggling. Historically, Nigeria has had high and sophisticated levels of migration, facilitated by the large diaspora communities. The market contributes to widespread corruption which enables the procurement of fake travel documents, and the country is a major hub for full-package style smuggling, serving the wider region. Nigerian smuggling networks connect people to Europe via Niger, and numerous smugglers operate from Lagos and Benin City.","text - trade":"Nigeria\u2019s location, as well as its particularly porous northern and eastern borders, and access to the ocean in the south, has made it an ideal transit point for the trafficking of small arms and light weapons (SALW). Imports from Turkey and Iran have been recorded, and Boko Haram terrorism, armed movements, piracy and banditry have sustained demand. Nigeria has experienced widespread insecurity resulting from banditry, kidnapping, robbery and oil-related violence, often perpetrated using heavy weapons. Many weapons are legitimately procured but diverted into the illicit market from national stockpiles. It is also common for security forces to sell or rent their weapons. Furthermore, since 2011 there has been increased circulation of Libyan stockpiles across the region.","text - environment":"Nigeria has become a major transit hub for wildlife trafficking, particularly for Central African ivory and pangolin scales as well as for donkey hides destined for Vietnam and China, the primary markets for wildlife products. Local fauna has been widely destroyed due to the trade, which affects Nigeria\u2019s populations of endangered species, including West African lions, Cross River gorillas, Cameroonian forest shrews and the white-throated and red-eared guenons. Fish stocks have also diminished due to water pollution, overfishing and illegal fishing, making Nigeria one of the largest global importers. There are allegation of local fishing nets being purposefully cut by foreign vessels who take the catch and load it for direct transportation to Europe or Asia, bypassing inspections. With regard to flora crimes, the illegal logging of rosewood in Cross River State is particularly prominent. The fall of crude oil prices coincided with a sudden growth in wood exports, and most wood export revenue is now generated illegally. The trade in rosewood, known locally as kosso, may have benefited Boko Haram, and a significant amount has been seized by Chinese customs officials. Since then, the trade has declined drastically due to depleted stock. ##&& Illegal oil bunkering is a problem in Nigeria, with oil stolen directly from pipelines, predominantly in the Niger Delta region, processed through artisanal refineries and then sold locally or smuggled abroad to China, North Korea, Israel and South Africa, among others. Bunkering operations are professional, and have access to arms and ties to foreign criminal actors who have the means to transport crude oil to refineries in Cameroon, Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, before moving it to destination markets. Illegal oil bunkering, as well as piracy and armed robbery at sea, are therefore serious concerns. Additionally, some small-scale illicit gold mining occurs in Nigeria, with local populations vulnerable to exploitation and co-option by Islamist groups.","text - drugs":"Nigeria is an important transit, source and destination market for illicit drugs. Afghan heroin is moved through Nigeria en route to Europe, with domestic networks collaborating with Afghani and Pakistani drug cartels for trafficking and distribution. Aided by corruption, these networks also facilitate the sea transport of heroin directly to Europe, the United States and the Middle East. The domestic heroin market has not grown, due in part to high use of synthetic drugs among the youth, typically very cheap codeine-based cough syrups. The proliferation of psychotropic substances, especially tramadol, amphetamine and codeine, is on the rise, with the port of Lagos serving as a large transit hub for tramadol shipments from Benin and India. The drug is distributed domestically, especially to the Edo and Kano states, which are starting points for people travelling to Niger. Additionally, Nigerian criminal networks have reportedly collaborated with Mexican cartels to set up crystal meth production facilities, so that methamphetamine originating in Nigeria is now available in South Africa and throughout destination markets in Asia. ##&& Nigeria is a major global cocaine destination and transshipment point. Its organized criminal groups are key contributors to the globalization of cocaine markets, and they retain a strong influence on the organization and determination of these markets. Nigerian actors control intra-African trade routes, and act as handlers for shipments to markets in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, using a diaspora network of co-conspirators. State corruption along with insecurity, particularly in the north, as well as the influence of violent non-state actors, who are becoming more centrally engaged as criminal competitors in the transiting of cocaine and other illicit drugs to consumer markets, all contribute to the massive cocaine trade. Cocaine, however, is an elitist drug, and as such only permeates specific levels of society within Nigeria. ##&& Nigeria is also a top regional producer and exporter of cannabis to Europe, enabled by weak control of national borders, corruption as well as by criminal groups with transnational reach and ties to other groups abroad. Cannabis is widely consumed domestically, indicating a rise in cultivation. In fact, the country\u2019s southwest region and southern states grow a significant percentage of the cannabis used in West Africa. However, there is evidence of a new type of cannabis from Ghana being sold on the domestic market, which is reportedly superior to the locally produced drug in terms of quality, processing and packaging.","text - criminal actors":"Opportunistic loose criminal networks are common and operate in every state of the country. They engage in a number of markets, including trafficking, smuggling, corruption, money laundering, advanced fee fraud, oil bunkering, banditry, kidnap for ransom and car theft. These networks vary in size and their loose structure and often short-lived duration inhibits their effective disruption by law enforcement agencies. In addition, state-embedded actors and corruption are widespread at all levels of government, particularly in public procurement and contracting. People involved in criminal enterprises may also go into politics. Moreover, embezzlement and bribery scandals involving high-level officials and projects have been reported in Nigeria. ##&& Foreign actors are also a significant part of the criminal landscape, especially at border areas. They are active in oil, gas, mining, arms trafficking, procurement overpricing, the supply of fake and substandard products, flora and fauna smuggling and practices associated with illicit financial flows. Most of these actors are from Asia, but criminal networks from Lebanon are also operating in Nigeria and throughout West Africa, using their connections and their legitimate businesses to aid trafficking activities. Additionally, Mexican cartels are allegedly working with Nigerian companies. While certain crime groups in Nigeria have known names and distinct identities, mafia-like groups remain relatively uncommon and are mostly engaged in oil bunkering. Violent mafia-style groups are also involved in kidnapping, armed robbery and smuggling. Nevertheless, Boko Haram also operates as a mafia-like group, evident in the recent appointment of leaders who would be responsible for the illicit taxation of communities. Other major sources of financing of terrorism for Boko Haram have been kidnap for ransom, illegal fishing and the protection rackets of politicians, especially in the north of the country.","text - leadership and governance":"Fighting organized crime and corruption has been at the forefront of the Buhari administration, but while banditry, armed robbery, smuggling, trafficking, cattle rustling and terrorism are commonly mentioned in political discourse, efforts remain entrenched at the federal level. Although the government is not considered transparent, measures to improve transparency and accountability have been introduced. President Muhammadu Buhariis recognized as less corrupt than his predecessors, and under his government, unprecedented convictions in high-profile cases of corruption have been recorded, and assets recovered. Furthermore, there has been a significant reduction in corruption among law enforcement and judicial officers, and a judicial panel is investigating allegations against the acting chairman of the foremost anti-corruption agency in the country. ##&& Nigeria has ratified many international agreements relevant to organized crime and the government cooperates with several international organizations and governments to fight trafficking, smuggling, corruption, money laundering and terrorism. The country is also a member of regional and global multilateral agencies and provides leadership in ECOWAS and the African Union. In 2019, Nigeria passed a law on the suppression of maritime crimes, and the country has also incorporated most United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) related legislation into its own statutes. While the relevant laws, policies and institutions are in place, coordination and capacity challenges exist.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judicial system in Nigeria is severely compromised. Federal judges are commonly accused of corruption and have been targeted by alleged politically motivated arrests. Judicial processes are slow and sometimes politically motivated, and the judiciary is under-resourced with inadequate facilities. Moreover, the number of pre-trial prisoners is alarming. Meanwhile, although the Nigeria Police Force is the country\u2019s leading police organization, several law enforcement agencies are responsible for policing duties. Despite accusations of politicization, some specialized agencies, such as the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission, have gained prominence under Buhari\u2019s presidency. The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), and National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control have also done important work in tackling organized crime. While law enforcement agencies are under-resourced, increased attention has been given to training. Nevertheless, allegations of torture, extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses against both the military and law enforcement persist. ##&& Nigeria is positioned along major transnational trafficking routes, and its terrestrial and maritime borders are porous and difficult to police. Despite these border issues, Boko Haram terrorism and armed militant groups, the country demonstrates reasonable capacity to protect its territory, and in 2019, Nigeria closed some land borders to movement of goods due to widespread smuggling.","text - economic and financial environment":"Despite being one of the most at-risk countries for money laundering and terrorist financing, Nigeria has seen significant progress in the implementation of international standards. The government utilizes institutions, laws, regulations, law enforcement and the judicial system to tackle corruption and money laundering, and an independent financial intelligence unit was established in 2018. Money stolen by a former military head of state and stashed in foreign jurisdictions has also been transferred back from Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the US. While no economic areas are controlled by organized crime groups, levels of pervasiveness in regulatory capacity may be high. However, laws, anti-corruption measures, business process reforms and executive orders aiming to strengthen the investment climate in the country are an indication of a good economic regulatory capacity. A law regulating all aspects of the registration and governance of private corporations and charity organizations was also recently passed. The financial sector is under the oversight of the Central Bank of Nigeria, and while related crimes fall under several anti-corruption agencies, challenges exist pertaining to resources and corruption.","text - civil society and social protection":"NAPTIP has increased activities geared towards stemming human trafficking and smuggling, and along with other law enforcement agencies, frequently arrests suspects andraids premises used to house victims. There is an increasing awareness of human trafficking and smuggling due to programmes led by the government and CSOs, and a combination of awareness raising, repatriation, victim rehabilitation and prosecution measures are currently employed. The government has also strengthened measures to raise awareness and curtail drug use. In 2019, harm reduction programmes were launched, but rehabilitation clinics are not available in Nigeria and alcohol- and drug-treatment throughout rehabilitation centres in the country have been criticized and dubbed \u2032inhumane\u2032. Some CSOs also provide shelters, counselling and rehabilitation. There have been several awareness and partnership efforts to address the fallout from organized criminal activities, and a hotline was created to report acts of bribery. Prevention activities are carried out by the Immigration Service, via the enhancement of electronic platforms and passport security features. ##&& Some local communities respond to organized crime, but mainly via vigilante groups, rather than CSO movements. These groups are sometimes supported by the government, and hand suspects over to the police or try them under extra-judicial procedures. Nigeria has an active civil society, and increasing government attempts to regulate associated activities are frequently resisted by CSOs. Some CSOs address drug prevention, treatment and care, but these initiatives lack funding. The country has a pluralist and vibrant media covering print, electronic, traditional and new media outlets. Historically, the Nigerian media has had a reputation for professionalism, trustworthiness and boldly engaging the government through criticism of policies and programmes. However, professionalism has declined, there is a perception of corruption among journalists and regulations have weakened. Fake and hate news are increasing and politicians own or exercise influence over newspapers. There is a significant level of distrust between the media and the government, especially law enforcement agencies, resulting in unwarranted arrests, detention and harassment of journalists. Nevertheless, there is still considerable press vitality and freedom.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Abuja","GDP (current $US million)":"448120.43","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"200963599","Land Area (sq. km)":"923770","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"98","Freedom in the World Index":"45","Human Development Index":"0.54","Global Peace Index":"2.87","Democracy Index":"4.10","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"25","GDP per capita (current US$)":"2230","1":"7.15","1.1":"7.05","1.2":"7.25","2":"5.50"},{"Corresp":"144","ISO-3":"RWA","Country":"Rwanda","ISO-2":"RW","Continent":"Africa","Region":"Central Africa","Flag file":"rw.png","1.

For those fleeing conflict in neighbouring countries, Rwanda\u2019s relative political and economic stability make it a destination or transit point for many irregular migrants and refugees. The country is not always a safe haven for refugees, however, and some people fleeing conflict and political violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Burundi become exposed to exploitation in Rwanda. There are allegations of female, and child refugees being subjected to sex trafficking in Congolese refugee camps, and of children being drafted into militias fighting in Burundi and the DRC. ##&& Most accounts describe Rwandan migrants travelling on their own rather than using the help of local smugglers. Nevertheless, reports also hint at various criminal networks supporting the migrant flows. Regional conflicts and Rwanda's conflict legacy mean that smuggling networks are active and established but operate with minimal violence or state attention.","text - trade":"Due to the legacy of the civil war (1990\u20131994), regional instability and porous borders, a high number of unregulated small arms and light weapons are in circulation in Rwanda. While these weapons are allegedly used in local robberies and grenade attacks, violence rates are low.","text - environment":"Although Rwanda has taken steps to improve governance in the extractive sector, the country is still engaged in the illegal and illicit exploitation of Congolese resources, especially gold, tin and tantalum. The illicit trade and laundering of illegally mined non-renewables are significant for Rwanda, and commonly believed to be one of the drivers of the country\u2019s growth. Moreover, while it does not occur on a major scale, wildlife trafficking, including that of ivory and rhino horn, remains a concern. Poaching is limited, but illicit products such as ivory, rhino horn, and other endangered species have been recorded as being transported through Rwanda in relatively high amounts. These often originate in Burundi and the DRC. Furthermore, Rwanda is a source and transit country for birds traded on the exotic pet market such as the grey crowned crane, which has had a significant reduction in population. A high degree of deforestation can be observed in Rwanda, as people exploit bamboo or firewood for fuel. However, this does not appear to be linked to organized criminal activity. Wood and charcoal are reportedly trafficked from the DRC to Rwanda, albeit to a limited extent.","text - drugs":"Rwanda\u2019s role in global drug markets is minor. Cannabis is the most consumed and trafficked illegal drug in the country, and Rwanda is a transshipment point for regionally produced cannabis, as well as a minor destination market. The criminal market for heroin is limited in scale and scope. Driven primarily by wealthier young people in the cities, consumption rates are low. However, as the country becomes a regional economic hub and the national airline expands, Rwanda\u2019s role in the transnational drug trade could potentially increase, and it could become a growing overland transshipment point for heroin arriving in East Africa destined for markets and transshipment points elsewhere in southern and Central Africa. ##&& The criminal market for cocaine is also believed to be limited in size, but there is evidence of trafficking and local use in Rwanda, with cocaine-related arrests taking place in Kigali. Cocaine is expected to arrive mainly via west and Central African airports. Little is known about the production, consumption and transportation of synthetic drugs in the country. The Gicumbi District in the north, has been identified as one of the main transit routes for the crude distilled gin known as kanyanga. This contraband is classified as a psychotropic substance due to its high alcohol content.","text - criminal actors":"Politically-motivated, armed non-state actors and militias involved in the conflict in the DRC continue to play primary roles in criminal markets and war economies of the Great Lakes region. This is largely due to the nature of the complex conflict in eastern DRC, where Rwanda has played an important role ever since The First Congo War (1996\u20131997). In addition to direct military involvement until 2003, Rwanda has backed several proxies in the DRC, including the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD), the March 23 Movement as well as other Tutsi and non-Tutsi groups. Rwanda has also been heavily engaged in the conflict in Burundi, possibly recruiting fighters and smuggling weapons. Alternatively, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) is a predominantly Hutu rebel group that comprises ex-soldiers and supporters of the Rwandan regime behind the 1994 genocide. Operating out of eastern DRC, the FDLR continues to make incursions into Rwanda and from the Kigali perspective, remains a major national security threat. Foreign criminal actors and networks exist in Rwanda and are involved in a variety of smuggling activities. The country's porous borders allow for various smugglers and militias from the DRC and Burundi to pass into Rwanda, facilitating the smuggling of different illicit goods such as weapons and drugs. ##&& Along with criminal networks and foreign actors, state-embedded actors also engage in criminality. Reports have indicated that members of Rwanda's military are primarily involved in the smuggling of weapons. Conversely, there is no evidence to suggest the existence of domestic mafia-style groups in the country.","text - leadership and governance":"Rwanda is considered among the safest and most stable states on the continent. This stability, however, is underpinned by repression and has not led to democratic consolidation or expanded civil freedoms which are extremely limited. The government has prioritized the fight against crime, and crime prevention has become an increasingly significant part of the national strategy for public safety and security. However, Rwanda continues to face some fragility with pervasive group grievance and deep involvement in larger geopolitical struggles affecting the region. Levels of perceived corruption are moderate, but that may be due to the strong technocratic management of the state rather than a result of accountability or transparency. While Rwanda has implemented strict penalties for corruption by officials, petty corruption among police and government officials is a problem and cronyism is rampant. Large-scale corruption tends to gravitate around the ruling party, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). ##&& Rwanda has shown a relatively high level of commitment to international cooperation against organized crime. The country has ratified most relevant international treaties, including the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. It has been an active member of the East African Community and African Union, often supporting institutional reforms and regional instruments to help meet security challenges and threats. In addition, INTERPOL\u2019s National Central Bureau (NCB) for Rwanda is located at the Kigali national police headquarters. Still, Rwanda generally lacks cooperation mechanisms with other countries on matters such as human trafficking. In 2018, the Rwandan Parliament amended various articles of its penal code pertaining to organized crime, increasing the sentences for drug-related crimes substantially. The penal code also covers criminal fauna markets and stipulates the sentences for a variety of fauna crimes. The government passed its first-ever law relating to human trafficking in 2018, making trafficking in persons a criminal offence.","text - criminal justice and security":"Rwanda\u2019s judiciary is not free from political interference and due process is far from guaranteed in cases with political significance. Rwandan courts lack efficiency. Nevertheless, the government has initiated reform of its justice system, seeking to modernize its judiciary and improve processing times for legal cases. Aside from corruption-related units, there are no judiciary-related specialized units in force with the aim of countering organized crime. Rwanda has at least two law enforcement units within the national police force tasked with countering organized crime, specifically financial and economic, and narcotics crimes. The Rwanda National Police lack specialized skills and have limited resources. However, community watch groups and other more informal crime prevention and law enforcement mechanisms often supplement police efforts and have become a source of resilience. While the Rwandan army actively patrols and secures borders, incursions by armed groups occur. Reports of rebel groups at the borders with the DRC and Burundi persist, and evidence suggests that these groups may cross over into Rwanda.","text - economic and financial environment":"Subsistence agriculture underpins the country\u2019s economy, with tea and coffee being some of Rwanda\u2019s biggest exports, as well as some manufacturing. Rwanda enjoys relative macroeconomic stability and a regulatory framework that, while far from perfect, is becoming increasingly conducive to investment and private sector development. ##&& The financial sector in Rwanda is modest and primarily dominated by banks. The country was assessed by the Financial Action Task Force in 2014, and significant scope for improvement was identified. Since then, Rwanda has taken considerable steps to establish a national AML\/CFT framework and has made progress in modernizing the financial sector. While money-laundering and terrorist financing does not appear to be a major concern in Rwanda as of now, the laundering of proceeds from the DRC is a concern.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government has demonstrated increased efforts to provide treatment and victim support, evident in establishing a facility for short-term victim care, continuing the practice of anti-human trafficking awareness-raising and supporting the rehabilitation of victims of crime as well as drug users. However, the government could implement many more mechanisms to help victims of organized crime, and human trafficking in particular. A large number of civil-society organizations are emerging to address social needs. However, the space for independent civil-society organizations is limited and many NGOs face serious restrictions.

The most important of these are turtles, as their meat and eggs are a common feature in the country\u2019s cuisine. While the possession, trade and sale of turtle meat have been banned, a market still exists and consumption continues. However, despite a somewhat weak enforcement of regulations, there has been an active campaign against turtle poaching, which is believed to have had an effect.

Nevertheless, the country\u2019s geographical position renders it vulnerable to some drug flows. Authorities have detected drug traffickers from Nigeria and Brazil using the country as a transit point for cocaine and heroin. These drugs are believed to be en route to other countries in the Gulf of Guinea basin and in many cases, ultimately destined for Europe. Although it is quite limited, the most consumed drug in the country is cannabis.

For instance, remote parts of the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 or the Pr\u00edncipe island can be used as platforms for attacks on ships in international waters. Foreign criminal actors have a presence in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and continue to manage drug trafficking through the islands. Corruption in the state, and particularly in the judiciary, is an issue with the potential to exacerbate some of the island\u2019s vulnerabilities. Local gangs are engaged primarily in petty crime, including robberies, hold-ups and theft, but have limited engagement with larger criminal markets. Although there are isolated incidents of robberies turning violent, this type of crime is rare.

The government has exhibited some political will to combat organized crime and in 2017 launched the strategic government plan, which includes a number of new measures and initiatives to prevent and combat organized crime. Although perceptions of corruption are moderate, corruption remains a considerable impediment to development and effective law enforcement in the country. While the government typically operates transparently and does not restrict access to information, there is a general feeling of distrust from the population towards state authorities and the integrity of some police officers has been questioned. ##&& S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe has ratified most relevant international treaties concerning transnational organized crime. Robust bilateral and multilateral protocols and networks between S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and other states or international organizations have been established. The country is a beneficiary of capacity-building programmes and engages in information exchanges with a variety of partners, both regionally and globally. However, the country\u2019s Constitution prohibits the extradition of its citizens from the national territory. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe has a number of laws pertaining to organized crime and a relatively robust legal framework. The National Assembly approved a new penal code in 2012, criminalizing trafficking and the use of narcotics as well as criminal associations. The penal code has integrated principles, contained in the conventions of regional and international organizations, of which S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is part.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judiciary is mostly independent, and courts generally uphold standards of due process in criminal matters.

In some cases, this may have resulted in trials dropped against politically connected people. There are a few judicial units in place with the specific aim of countering organized crime, such as the Judiciary Police. While the situation has improved, not least because of international assistance, the police and security forces lack the equipment, capacity and resources necessary to respond to crime in a timely and comprehensive manner. In particular, there is a need for improvement in combating maritime crime, and for this, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe continues to be dependent on Portuguese and foreign vessels and warships. This need is particularly pressing in light of the long coastline and vast maritime borders that are difficult to police and monitor.

It is not currently an attractive investment destination and private sector development faces some serious constraints. There is little evidence that the country is exposed to large scale illicit financial activity such as money laundering. However, its Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism protocol does not currently meet global standards, and its regulatory and supervisory processes lack the capacity to respond to money laundering and terrorist financing risks, and to enforce financial regulations. While the government is working to address these deficiencies, they continue to be a source of vulnerability for the country.

Children from Guinea-Bissau are regularly trafficked to Senegal for forced labour by Quranic teachers, an old practice exploited due to the high profits gained from child begging. Senegal is also a hub for labour agencies recruiting West Africans to the Gulf, the Middle East and Europe. These activities are under-regulated, which results in people being exploited and trafficked for forced prostitution, in destination countries. ##&& The human smuggling market is not as pervasive as it was previously when Senegal was a major country of origin and a transit hub for people smuggled to Europe from West Africa. Currently, most foreign nationals in Senegal do not need a visa to be admitted into the country. Many international donors are supported by consulates based in Senegal, which has attracted the visa-fraud industry. This results in high levels of corruption, and Senegal therefore remains a major hub for document and visa fraud for people seeking passage through the country. Smuggling has typically been a low-level criminal activity void of stigma, and smuggler services are blatantly offered at transport hubs, and in conjunction with the legal transport industry.","text - trade":"Senegal is a relatively peaceful and stable country, although a low-scale conflict which started in 1982 has been ongoing in the southern region of Casamance. Since then, the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC) has been consistently acquiring arms, for use in its insurrection against the government. Although the market is comparably small, Dakar appears to have become a choice target for traffickers, as suggested by increased arms seizures. Furthermore, there has been significant arms circulation in the southern towns of Medina Gounass and Diaoube, as well as in the more centrally located Touba.","text - environment":"The illicit flora market in Senegal has grown substantially. Forests within the Casamance region along the Gambian border have been largely destroyed by Chinese criminal actors and Casamance rebels, and after a period of intensive illegal logging, African rosewood is becoming increasingly endangered. Rosewood trees are illegally felled, smuggled across the border to The Gambia, and subsequently exported to China. The rate of trafficking across the border has worsened, and although a move by shipping lines to halt exporting rosewood has reduced trafficking, this is expected to be temporary. The former Gambian president has been accused of playing a major role in the deforestation of the forests, whereby timber was traded through a shell company. Living conditions of the local population that largely rely on tourism and agriculture, have worsened as a result. ##&& With regard to wildlife crimes, fishing, as the main livelihood of the Senegalese, is becoming increasingly scarce, with the fishing sector severely affected by fraud and corruption, corporatism and a de facto monopoly organized or maintained by the state. Senegalese waters are categorized as overfished, with instances of local fishing nets being cut by foreign trawlers, with sizeable catches then loaded directly onto container ships. Most large fishing vessels operating illegally in Senegalese waters are from Europe, China and Russia, and there are mounting tensions between Mauritanian and Senegalese fishermen, who trespass into Mauritania's waters, and are met with violence. Senegalese artisanal fishermen have therefore turned to unsustainable practices, such as catching juvenile fish. On land, Senegal is a major transit hub for illicit ivory trafficking, and leopard pelts and crocodile skins have also been seized, as have wild birds destined for Spain. The trafficking of fauna, which includes lion hides and bones, aardvark feet, vultures as well as the scimitar-horned oryx, usually occurs for traditional Chinese and African medicine markets. ##&& Senegal does not have an abundance of non-renewable resources, but illicit gold mining does exist. Illegal gold mining and smuggling mainly involve nationals from other West African countries operating in the south eastern region of Kedougou. The recent discovery of oil and gas could potentially increase the role of the illicit economy. Additionally, it has been reported that land lost to illegal logging and insufficient income from agriculture may force villagers to resort to gold mining.","text - drugs":"Cannabis is the most used drug in Senegal. The market is particularly pervasive in the Casamance region, where cannabis is cultivated by MFDC separatists. Cannabis production and sales continue on the Karone Islands near The Gambia, mainly involving Senegalese and Bissau-Guineans. Senegal is also a trans-shipment point for regional cannabis, particularly resin moving through Dakar into neighbouring countries. The country has become an important hub for cocaine trafficked to Europe and nearly all routes from West Africa to Morocco pass through Senegal. While some of the drug is consumed locally, the market is relatively small. Recent heroin seizures have been minimal, however there are a significant number of users in the country. With regard to synthetic drugs, the market is limited, however, Senegal is reportedly used as a transit country.","text - criminal actors":"Senegal is becoming a hub for foreign criminals due to the comparatively high level of development and stability in the country. In addition to Nigerian criminal actors, who have operated in Senegal for decades, primarily in drug trafficking, cybercrime and human trafficking, other nationals from West African countries operate as illegal miners and smugglers in the gold-rich south-eastern region of Kedougou. Furthermore, Asian vessels are often noted to be fishing illegally off the Senegalese coast, while some Chinese nationals are reportedly involved in wildlife crime, particularly ivory trafficking. There are many criminal networks in Senegal involved in drug trafficking and money laundering, and most have connections to foreign groups. For instance, the vehicle-trafficking market has grown substantially in the region, and French-based criminal networks involved in this market have representatives in Senegal. They are tasked with selling the stolen vehicles within the region, and subsequently launder the profits. ##&& While Senegal\u2019s institutions function appropriately for the most part, corruption is occasionally reported by local media or civil society. For instance, high-ranking officials were allegedly involved in timber trafficking in Casamance. Conversely, mafia-style groups, in the strictest sense, do not operate in Senegal. However, there are economic groups that seize criminal opportunities to make money and have the potential to develop into consolidated mafia-style organizations. Some individuals with known names, from influential religious families, are heavily involved in the trafficking of counterfeit medicines, and although there is government awareness, such actors operate with impunity and often enjoy government protection. Religious leaders also exert influence on the government\u2019s decision-making process.","text - leadership and governance":"Senegal is a relatively stable nation compared to other African countries but is fairly at-risk to political instability. The government consistently prioritizes the fight against organized crime, with the issue firmly positioned on the country's national security agenda. Furthermore, significant progress has been made in responding to certain crime-specific markets, including timber trafficking, where a new forest code was adopted by the National Assembly in 2018.Perceptions of corruption are moderate, and the creation of anti-corruption bodies in the wake of the 2012 election was cause for optimism for many. However, there is evidence to suggest that these bodies are biased, as no actors from the President\u2019s party have been prosecuted for financial crimes. In addition, Senegalese media have almost unanimously blamed the country's inability to make progress with regard to countering corruption, on a lack of political will. ##&& Senegal has ratified all international treaties relevant to organized crime, including the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC). However, the implementation of UNTOC and cooperation with other states remains weak, notably with regard to extradition. Nonetheless, Senegal's cooperation with its immediate neighbours, The Gambia and Guinea Bissau, has been growing. A memorandum of understanding has been signed between Gambian and Senegalese drug and law enforcement agencies, and cross-border operations are regularly organized, and facilitated by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Efforts have also been made to ensure that Senegal ratifies the MEDICRIME Convention. Furthermore, a legal framework for countering organized crime exists in Senegal, particularly in relation to timber trafficking, cyber security and transnational terrorism. Senegal has also developed a national drug strategy and has initiated changes to the country's drug laws, however, some national laws are in need of revision.","text - criminal justice and security":"The justice system in Senegal is adequate with regard to prosecuting criminals engaged in organized crime. However, the judiciary\u2019s capacity to tackle organized crime is limited, and there are no judiciary-related specialized units tasked with countering organized crime. The transnational aspect of organized crime is not fully integrated within Senegalese judicial practices, and there is therefore a need for enhanced capacity building for legal practitioners. ##&& Senegalese law enforcement is often cited as one of the most professional and dynamic in Africa, despite a shortage of training and resources. However, there appears to be no specialized units of law enforcement established with the specific aim of countering organized crime. The country's extensive land borders are porous and cross-border crimes do occur between Senegal and neighbouring countries. Nonetheless, Senegal continues to maintain its territorial integrity.","text - economic and financial environment":"Senegal has made the greatest progress in combating money laundering among the members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union. However, there is little evidence of high-level prosecutions, particularly for those with political connections, and significant money laundering activity still occurs. The country has a national anti-money laundering strategy, but it is lacking. Additionally, challenges with regards to ease of doing business may explain, in part, why many rely on informal practices.","text - civil society and social protection":"Significant action has been noted in the area of victim support in Senegal. For instance, a drug treatment centre, the only one of its kind in West Africa, opened in Dakar in 2016. Efforts are also being made by the government to prevent and combat organized crime, and awareness events around the proliferation of arms and light weapons are regularly organized. However, more can be done to help victims exit slavery. Senegal's civil society is extremely active and freedom of the press is generally respected. While a degree of intimidation toward, and self-censorship of, journalists reporting on issues of corruption is present in Senegal, the media environment is robust and diverse.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Dakar","GDP (current $US million)":"23578.08","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"16296364","Land Area (sq. km)":"196710","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"73.4","Freedom in the World Index":"71","Human Development Index":"0.51","Global Peace Index":"1.82","Democracy Index":"5.67","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"45","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1447","1":"4.82","1.1":"5.00","1.2":"4.63","2":"5.58"},{"Corresp":"151","ISO-3":"SYC","Country":"Seychelles","ISO-2":"SC","Continent":"Africa","Region":"Southern Africa","Flag file":"sc.png","1.

Evidence suggests that young children from the Seychelles and migrant women are sexually exploited within the country and some nationals are trafficked for forced labour in the Middle East. Foreign and migrant workers in the Seychelles also fall victim to labour trafficking in sectors such as domestic work, fisheries, agriculture and construction. The Seychelles is also a transit country for human-trafficking victims and Seychellois recruitment agencies often play a role in transnational human trafficking operations by recruiting workers in both the Seychelles and Madagascar. ##&& The Seychelles is a common destination for workers originating in South Asia, East Asia and East Africa. More than 20% of the Seychelles\u2019 labour force comes from abroad, and there is evidence that many migrant workers are smuggled into the country. Countries that have been identified as popular source countries for irregular migrants and refugees smuggled into the Seychelles include India, Madagascar, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and Syria. Key industries in the Seychelles have become increasingly reliant upon migrant labour, which could increase the risk of people being smuggled into the country and exploited by recruitment agencies. ","text - trade":"Firearms ownership and the number of illicit firearms in the Seychelles is low. Moreover, a reduction in numbers has been recorded, and violence in the country is often carried out with knives and machetes rather than with firearms. At the same time, however, the Seychelles has come to occupy an important role in global arms trafficking flows as Seychelles-registered shell corporations have reportedly been involved in facilitating the trafficking of arms between third countries. Cases from recent years include arms shipments involving sanctioned states like North Korea. Additionally, the illicit brokering of arms in the territorial waters of Seychelles is a substantial challenge.","text - environment":"Environmental criminal markets in Seychelles are generally limited in scope and scale. However, while it is mostly protected from the prevalent wildlife trafficking found on mainland Africa, the country is a source for the illicit reptile trade. The giant bronze gecko, endemic to the Seychelles, is only found on one island, and in very small numbers. Due to its rarity, it is regarded as one of the most prized pets by enthusiasts and is thus a target of wildlife traffickers. Another known problem is illegal fishing and lobster catching. Illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing causes substantial revenue loss and dramatic depletion in the lobster population. Chinese and Sri Lankan trawlers are often responsible for these crimes. Illegal felling of trees is believed to occur in unknown quantities, particularly on Mah\u00e9, but there is no evidence of organized crime. Additionally, poaching of the rare coco-de-mer seed has become more common in the Seychelles since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.","text - drugs":"The Seychelles is mostly a destination market for heroin, but cannabis, cocaine and synthetic drugs are smuggled into the country as well. It is undergoing a worrying heroin epidemic with an extremely high percentage of the country\u2019s working-age population consuming the drug. Indeed, the Seychelles could potentially be among the countries in the world with the highest per-capita consumers of heroin. Heroin is trafficked to East and Southern Africa or to Madagascar, and then transported to the Seychelles for consumption. Some shipments have also been imported from Southern Asia. Furthermore, there have been confirmed instances where shipments are dropped off in Seychellois waters by boats trafficking heroin from Iran and Pakistan to East Africa. Cannabis is the most widely consumed drug on the island and appears to be the second-most pervasive drug market. The domestic cannabis cultivation industry supplies some of the local demand, but cannabis is also imported from Madagascar, which is a major producer. ##&& Though the criminal market is still limited in size, cocaine, particularly crack, has reportedly increased in popularity. Reported seizures are primarily made at the airport, with some evidence suggesting that syndicates use drug \u2018mules\u2019 for transport. Actors trafficking cocaine to the Seychelles tend to be of Seychellois, Brazilian, Kenyan, Tanzanian or South African origin. Historically, there has been no major market for synthetic drugs, however, there is evidence that this is changing, with increasing consumption of the drug known as 'flakka', or 'K2'. Ecstasy is also available in the Seychelles but is not widely consumed. Overall, synthetic drug markets and trade seem relatively manageable, and major organized crime activity in this market is unconfirmed.","text - criminal actors":"Criminal actors operating in the Seychelles are predominantly, though not exclusively, Seychellois. Loose criminal networks are engaged in criminal activities in Seychelles, with evidence suggesting that drug imports are largely controlled by a small number of Seychellois traffickers who reportedly recruit skippers and crew members of fishing vessels to pick up drug shipments at sea, and to bribe corrupt officials and police officers to ensure shipments are brought in without detection. Domestic drug retailing is controlled by different criminal groups and networks. These may have some level of hierarchy and organization, but this has been difficult to determine. ##&& Eden Island, a small enclave, which is home to a large community of South African expatriates, is cited as a base for a cocaine-importing network. While foreign networks are involved in trafficking to the islands via sea and air routes, their activity appears limited to shipments arranged by drug importers based in the Seychelles. On the other hand, illegal fishing is largely carried out by foreign vessels, primarily Chinese and Sri Lankan. It is likely that human trafficking, especially for the purposes of forced labour, would be carried out, in part, by foreign nationals residing in the country. Verifiable accounts of involvement of state officials in crime or the facilitation of crime are not prevalent in the Seychelles. Nevertheless, there are various allegations of bribery and collusion between actors in the criminal drug markets and politics.","text - leadership and governance":"The Seychellois government is vocal and open about its stance on organized crime, particularly regarding piracy and drug trafficking. In response to the dramatic rise in heroin consumption, the government has taken significant steps and allocated resources to manage the issue. However, corruption has often been an impediment to the effective fight against organized crime and the country's international positioning on drug trafficking has not manifested in domestic anti-corruption initiatives. ##&& The Seychelles has ratified a number of relevant international treaties pertaining to organized crime with the notable exception of the Firearms Protocol of the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC). The government has committed to international cooperation against organized crime and implemented joint anti-trafficking measures in areas such as wildlife crime, drug trafficking, anti-piracy and maritime security. The Seychelles houses an EU-supported Regional Coordination Cooperation Centre which brings together the Western Indian Ocean region and European states for coordination on maritime crime, including drug trafficking. The country has also historically cooperated with the UNODC and Combined Task Force 150 on initiatives to counter piracy and drug trafficking in the region. Cooperation initiatives have also been carried out with other global naval powers on maritime security including the US, French and Indian navies. The Seychelles has an extradition treaty in place with the US. ##&& It also has a relatively strong legal framework in place for combating some forms of organized crime. With regard to drugs, the legal framework focuses on harm reduction and recovery for users, while shifting the punitive aspect towards traffickers and actors profiting from criminal markets. Anti-human trafficking legislation is in place but is not adequately capable of tackling the labour trafficking issues faced by the country. Separate legislation exists for combating money laundering and asset seizure, but money laundering remains a systemic vulnerability.","text - criminal justice and security":"The Seychellois judiciary is, for the most part, independent and able to provide criminal defendants\u2019 guarantees of due process. The courts have been able to secure a number of convictions for organized crime in the last number of years. However, the judicial process is slow and court cases can take years to complete. The Seychelles also suffers a high incarceration rate and prison overcrowding. The police force was reorganized in 2017 and now contains a specialized Anti-Narcotics Bureau. Seychellois law enforcement, particularly the coastguard, enjoys substantial international support and is a beneficiary of foreign assistance and capacity building from partners abroad. Furthermore, the country has passed legislation to establish an intelligence service with a mandate to fight transnational organized crime. At the same time, Seychellois law enforcement is overstretched and often lacks the capacity to monitor and enforce the law across the country\u2019s large maritime territories. The greatest obstacle to countering drug trafficking, however, is corruption at both the lower and higher ranks of the police.","text - economic and financial environment":"The country\u2019s economy is one of the strongest in the region, but economic freedom remains restricted. The public sector, which accounts for around 40% of employment, is quite inefficient and the formal labour market is not fully established. This can enable the exploitation of foreign workers. The Seychelles is an offshore secrecy jurisdiction and well-known tax haven, which makes it a very desirable country to register shell companies and funnel illicit wealth. The country\u2019s financial sector is believed to hold numerous offshore accounts containing illicit gains. In 2020, the Seychelles was listed on the EU's list of non-cooperative jurisdictions because of concerns that the country's policy environment enables tax fraud and evasion, tax avoidance, money laundering and\/or terrorist financing. It is also largely non-cooperative with regard to beneficial ownership and other key areas of financial transparency. Seychellois shell companies have been linked to multiple investigations into international corruption and organized crime. Legal and institutional reforms have been made to the country\u2019s AML\/CFT framework. While this has increased the Seychelles AML\/CFT capacity, it continues to have significant flaws in its framework for combating the flow of dirty money, and authorities depend on foreign expertise to implement the AML\/CFT framework.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government has dedicated significant resources to rehabilitation and health-oriented policy responses and initiatives to curtail the rise in heroin use. Evidence suggests that the effects of these responses are positive. On the other hand, victims of human trafficking have not experienced the same level of support and significant gaps in the victim and witness protection programmes of such crimes persist. A number of measures are in place for organized crime prevention in the Seychelles, but prevention efforts are lacking in areas such as human trafficking. Civil society is robust and the state does for the most part upholds citizens\u2019 right to organize and their freedom to assemble. Civil society organizations and NGOs have been successful in holding the government to account and have often intervened in matters where the government is under-resourced or has failed to respond effectively. Critical journalism and free media is mostly respected, but media pluralism is limited, self-censorship is common and, as a consequence, media coverage tends to steer clear of controversial topics such as corruption.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Victoria","GDP (current $US million)":"1703.39","Income group":"High income","Population":"97625","Land Area (sq. km)":"460","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"56.3","Freedom in the World Index":"77","Human Development Index":"0.8","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"","Regime Type":"","Corruption Perceptions Index":"66","GDP per capita (current US$)":"17448","1":"3.68","1.1":"3.60","1.2":"3.75","2":"4.58"},{"Corresp":"152","ISO-3":"SLE","Country":"Sierra Leone","ISO-2":"SL","Continent":"Africa","Region":"West Africa","Flag file":"sl.png","1.

Trafficking victims are for the most part recruited from the rural areas and are trafficked internally, to both urban centers and mining hubs, with local demand driving most of the child sex trafficking. Reportedly, human traffickers usually operate individually, assuring the parents of potential victims that the latter will have a better access to education. In addition, children from neighbouring countries are also exploited in Sierra Leone, while local children are trafficked to Niger, Mali and Guinea, where they are subject to forced and sexual exploitation. Similarly, men from different countries around the world have also been reported as forced labour victims in Sierra Leonean mines. Certain reports have indicated the existence of trafficking flows of children and women from Sierra Leone to the Gulf countries for domestic work. ##&& Conflict and natural disasters in Sierra Leone have triggered large migration flows. Most Sierra Leoneans are described as migrating voluntarily, seeking to be smuggled to and through states outside the Economic Community of West African States, such as Libya. Once there, they become vulnerable to human trafficking. ","text - trade":"There have been several accounts of military officers and other government officials trafficking government weapons and ammunition. Cross-border smuggling of weapons is described as small-scale, with arms primarily flowing outwards to Liberia. Proceeds from other illicit activities, such as the illegal logging of timber, are occasionally used to buy weapons. Notably, however, domestic craft production of weapons is the most significant source of illicit arms in the country.","text - environment":"Illegal logging constitutes a serious challenge to Sierra Leonean forests and wildlife. There is evidence of corruption and the selling of concessions to Chinese trading companies, in violation of the national trading moratorium. Access to artisanal logging is often contingent on support for certain political parties or politically connected people. The widespread felling of trees for commercial charcoal production, in places such as the Western Area Forest Reserve, is also a serious concern. Additionally, an illicit fauna market exists in Sierra Leone where large shipments of pangolins originate for trafficking, facilitated by economic ties between the country and East Asia. Other species, such as the white-necked rockfowl, the pygmy hippo, forest elephants and various monkeys are also threatened by poaching. Chimpanzee poaching for bushmeat and the illegal pet trade is common as well. Most prominently, illegal fishing has increased in recent years, particularly by foreign fishing vessels and accounts allege that high-ranking officials have been involved in the trade as well. ##&& In terms of non-renewable resource crimes, Sierra Leone experiences high levels of artisanal and small-scale gold mining and gold smuggling. Many actors are involved, and large parts of the country are affected. Additionally, domestic criminal groups and criminal entrepreneurs rather than international syndicates dominate the small-scale diamond mining in Sierra Leone.","text - drugs":"Cannabis sativa is reportedly the most widely abused drug in the country. At the domestic level, cultivation and use has increased dramatically, not without the significant assistance of specific branches of the state's law enforcement agencies. Currently, cannabis sativa in the Mano River Union is produced predominantly in Sierra Leone, and the country is the largest West African exporter of the drug to countries across Africa, the US, Europe and the Middle East. In regard to synthetic drugs, Sierra Leone experiences high levels of trade and use of tramadol, although the rising prices have resulted in a decrease in the demand. Since the pandemic started, however, there has been a major influx of crystal meth in the country. Street hawkers sell most of the opioid drugs. Substances used by children and youth include benzodiazepines such as diazepam, chlorpromazine and other inhalants. The synthetic drugs market can be described as expanding and the transnational routing of synthetics out of Sierra Leone leads to European and Asian markets. ##&& Local consumption of cocaine in Sierra Leone is low. Nevertheless, the country is used by South American criminal organizations and some West African countries as a distribution and waypoint centers for drugs intended for markets in North America and Europe, and more recently to East and South East Asian markets. Reports of individual cases of heroin trafficking have been sporadic, indicating that Sierra Leone plays a minor role, if any, in the global heroin-trafficking trade.","text - criminal actors":"Domestic criminal groups are for the most part composed of Sierra Leonean nationals who cooperate with foreign nationals on occasion. This type of criminal actor is mostly involved in the trafficking of drugs, arms, timber and illegal diamonds. Most criminal networks hide their illegal operations behind front companies or small legitimate ventures. While generally perceived as less sophisticated, some local organizations' reach extends internationally, beyond Sierra Leone. ##&& Moreover, Colombian cartels have established safe passage for their cocaine contraband through Sierra Leone by bribing top government and military officials. Chinese companies, citizens and organized criminal groups are involved in illicit smuggling activities in Sierra Leone from abroad, in particular timber logging and wildlife trafficking, though both have declined due to a lack of demand and increased national and international scrutiny. Sierra Leonean traffickers often partner with regional gangs for drug smuggling. Cooperation is also established with Kuwaiti gangs in order to recruit and traffic Sierra Leonean citizens to Europe, the US and Kuwait. Lebanese businesspeople, many of whom are naturalized Sierra Leoneans, and some with connections to Hezbollah, continue to control the legal and illegal trade in gemstones and diamonds. Not least of all, Nigerian cartels are also known to operate in the country, engaging in primarily in the cocaine trade and controlling certain areas in Freetown. ##&& It is common for officials throughout the state apparatus to engage in bribery and turn a blind eye to organized crime. Research has also drawn attention to the connection between prominent politicians and gangs, which are primarily used to achieve political objectives. Most of these groups are prominent in Freetown, often extending to urban centres throughout the country. They are especially exploited around elections. Currently, mafia-style criminal groups in the form of organized gangs with known names, colors and symbols are operating in Sierra Leone. While they are allegedly linked to political parties and are reportedly involved in different trafficking operations, their influence is limited.","text - leadership and governance":"Corruption and mass poverty prevail despite the successful holding of four post-war elections and two peaceful transfers of power. The post-war governments have shown some willingness to address these problems but any attempt to promote change is threatened by vested interests. Given Sierra Leone's immense developmental constraints, prospects for political and economic transformation in the country are still fairly poor. ##&& At the international level, Sierra Leone has ratified, and is participating in, international protocols and regional initiatives to combat transnational organized crime. The country is also a recipient of international funding to combat organized crime, including money to improve intelligence-led policing and the prosecution of organized crime cases. On the domestic level, Sierra Leone has a number of laws related to organized crime. However, the overall framework is poorly financed and understaffed, and in need of significant improvement.","text - criminal justice and security":"Although Sierra Leone has made several strides in strengthening its justice system since 2002, the judiciary is still politically dependent in practice. These efforts to bolster the sector continue to be hampered by many factors, including corruption, lack of resources, unprofessionalism of the police and overcrowding in prisons. People are thus forced to rely on the customary law system. As for law enforcement, policing in Sierra Leone remains sub-standard by most measures. The police force has sought to strengthen its response to growing crime, but the lack of adequate resources has impeded these attempts. Moreover, the inability of the police to cover remote areas, corruption as well as interference with their work continues to erode public perceptions of the force. In terms of territorial integrity, Sierra Leone\u2019s borders, both land and sea, are porous, with a high number of illegal crossing points at which different types of goods are smuggled. Despite the formal closure of land borders in March 2020 in response to COVID-19, the lack of enforcement capacity and remoteness of some borders means smuggling is still possible.","text - economic and financial environment":"Sierra Leone\u2019s economic development is described as low, with large parts of the population engaging in subsistence agriculture. In spite of having considerable natural, agricultural and fishery resources, GDP growth has been driven in the last decade by the mining sector, iron ore in particular. A number of factors, including corruption, weak regulatory capacity and poor oversight has put Sierra Leone at risk of money laundering, with dirty money flowing primarily from drug trafficking as well as illicit mineral transactions. There are also suggestions that casinos and high-end hotels are being used to launder illegal wealth. Moreover, the country\u2019s AML\/CFT controls remain underdeveloped and underfunded.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government has demonstrated significant efforts in investigating and prosecuting human trafficking as well as in identifying victims and referring them to proper care and temporary shelters.

Most victims come from south-central Somalia, and are destined mainly for Europe, the Gulf states and Southern African states. Ethiopians transiting Somalia are also vulnerable to victimization. It is common for women in the country to act as recruiters and intermediaries. Al-Shabaab also participates in these practices, particularly to recruit child soldiers, as well as engaging in sexual slavery and forced marriage. ##&& Given the decades of conflict in Somalia, human smuggling is a well-entrenched practice, with little resistance from the state. On the contrary, smuggling rings have a long reach and often collude with authorities. Human smuggling is thus considered a viable source of income for Somali citizens, especially those living in the northern part of the country. It is primarily a source country for human smuggling, with many people smuggled across East Africa to Libya, and on towards Europe, as well as a major transit hub for the smuggling of Ethiopian migrants. Pirates often act as smugglers for people moving across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen. Due to regional threats and the current humanitarian situation in Yemen, many Somali expats are also seeking to return home. Although being a less violent market, the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the influx of migrants, which has caused clans to clash.","text - trade":"Due to armed violence and political instability since the early 1990s, a significant number of illegal weapons are available in Somalia, ranging from pistols to machine guns and explosive devices, and are commonly trafficked by clan militias, al-Shabaab, governmental groups, and transnational trafficking networks based in the north, particularly Puntland and eastern Somaliland. Criminal groups also receive weapons from local security forces. Overall, arms trafficking in Somalia is endemic and only seems to be growing.","text - environment":"Despite a 2012 ban on charcoal exports from Somalia, the commodity is still consistently smuggled out of the country. The cutting of trees for the illicit charcoal trade has contributed to deforestation and land degradation, which further exacerbates the problems of food insecurity and cyclical drought. Additionally, charcoal and other timber products may be taxed by criminal syndicates at certain border crossings, which may contribute to terrorism financing in an indirect way. In regard to fauna crimes, there are reports of ivory and rhino-horn smuggling in the country. Somalia is also a hub for the illegal cheetah trade, with animals arriving from Ethiopia destined for Saudi Arabia or the UAE. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is also prevalent. Furthermore, there is evidence of considerable corruption related to the issuance of prospecting and mining rights and concessions, particularly in the hydrocarbon exploration industry.","text - drugs":"The domestic heroin market is non-existent in Somalia but heroin shipments reportedly pass through Somali territorial waters. Similarly, there is no evidence of high-volume trafficking of cocaine, cannabis, or synthetic drugs. This is in large part because neighbouring states have far more stable security environments and networks that are easily co-opted. Moreover, the threat of al-Shabaab executing any drug traffickers remains.","text - criminal actors":"In Somalia, al-Shabaab operates under the ranks of a transnational crime syndicate, and is sponsored through engaging in a number of criminal activities, including extortion and racketeering as well as trafficking. In particular, al-Shabaab employs mafia-style tactics of violence and intimidation to collect taxes on various goods. Many other militant actors function on Somalia\u2019s territory, ranging from warlord and clan militias to different militant groups. Moreover, criminal networks operating in Somalia, frequently work with al-Shabaab. Criminal entrepreneurs appear to be the primary drivers of criminal networks in the country, with a number of prominent and internationally connected figures taking the foreground. They control ethnic or clan-based networks that coordinate to smuggle commodities to East African and Gulf countries. Pirate networks have more fluid structures and two major groups can be identified \u2013 one operating in the north-eastern part of the country, in Puntland, and the other one controlling central Somalia. They tend to share personnel, resources, territory and most importantly, profits. ##&& The resources controlled by the government in Somalia are minimal due to the state\u2019s weakness. At the same time, corruption is widespread. Evidence shows that state officials and government authorities are also involved in organized criminal activities, specifically in taxing flows or gatekeeping illegal activities in return for bribes. As for foreign actors, North and East African traffickers tend to control many trafficking networks in Somalia. Horn of Africa foreign entrepreneurs and business interests in Somalia often employ techniques that skirt legality. Qatar and the UAE have influenced Somali electoral processes through dark money and bribery. A high number of foreign fighters have also joined al-Shabaab. Lastly, the sustainability of Somalia\u2019s fisheries is under threat by the presence of foreign fishing vessels, many of which operate illegally.","text - leadership and governance":"Somalia is a fragmented country and is characterized by internal tension, violent extremism, extensive displacements, and weak governance. After decades of conflict, there is still no formal legitimate authority in place that has complete control over the entire territory. The lack of functioning state institutions has led to scant interest in developing or promoting political and economic processes that could lead to peace and stability. Al-Shabaab continues to function largely undisturbed and launches strikes targeting both military and civil targets in the country. ##&& At an international level, Somalia has ratified three of the 10 relevant international treaties on organized crime. Notably, the country has ratified the protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the Convention on Narcotic Drugs. Gulf countries and especially the UAE have strengthened their political and military support for Somalia. Most NGOs and all UN agencies are banned from territories that are controlled by al-Shabaab. On the domestic level, while Somalia has several laws related to organized crime, it is the worst performing country in the world when its come to rule of law. Somalia's penal code has not been updated since 1964. Currently, there is no legislation that explicitly criminalizes sex trafficking and forced labour.","text - criminal justice and security":"Somalia\u2019s federal judiciary has become increasingly active and includes a unit tasked with prosecuting terrorism offences, as well as financial and economic crimes. The country also has local courts that work with a combination of traditional and Islamic law. Nevertheless, access to justice is low and the formal justice system faces challenges and criticism. Military courts are still used throughout Somalia to try civilians, primarily suspected members of al-Shabaab and Islamic State. This fragmentation and contestation, coupled with long-standing corruption and impunity, ensures that there is little public credibility in the overarching rule of law. Currently, there is no functioning judicial system in Somalia capable of prosecuting organized crime. Moreover, Somalia has a weak police force that has been receiving sustained technical assistance, capacity building, strategic support, and equipment from different UN Agencies. In addition, the government accepts bilateral support for its policing and security. Overall, the penetration and legitimacy of the Somali national police is limited to the communities in which it serves, and professionalism and integrity of individual police officers is similarly restricted. In regard to territorial integrity, the government controls an extremely minor part of the territory and its influence varies among the semi-autonomous regions. The country's significant coastline and land borders are porous and smuggling activities are common.","text - economic and financial environment":"The popularity of private sector mobile money transfer operators has contributed to the weakening of the Central Bank of Somalia. In addition, robust informal money systems, known as hawala, serve the vast Somali diaspora, and allow transactions to flow across borders without surveillance. Money transfer operators have no real anti-money laundering infrastructure, which means most transactions fall outside of the formal financial system\u2019s capacity to regulate. Al-Shabaab routinely uses domestic financial institutions, including commercial banks and mobile money services, to collect, store and distribute revenue, also using mobile money to make salary payments to its soldiers and officials. The government relies on the international community to play an active role in clarifying counterterrorism and anti-money laundering regulations to financial institutions, though this means that attention is more often focused on narrow Combating the Financing of Terrorism concerns rather than combating illicit financial flows related to criminal acts. In general, the commercial sector, as well as public procurement, international aid and concessions in the country are based on patronage networks and tight monopolies that dominate the market.","text - civil society and social protection":"Most of Somalia\u2019s population live in a situation of almost permanent food insecurity. The central state essentially has no capacity to provide basic services, and is reliant on the provision of food, shelter and medical supplies from the international community. International assistance is taxed by al-Shabaab, and the distribution of aid is politicized to reinforce local power. Meanwhile, the government has introduced several national and international policies that aim to prevent transnational organized crime. Somalia also has low-level and high-level defector programmes, aimed at bringing and keeping individuals out of al-Shabaab. However, these have been extensively infiltrated by al-Shabaab and are generally considered to be ineffective. In regard to the media, Somalia ranks among the most dangerous countries for journalists in the world. Journalists who express themselves freely are potential targets of al-Shabaab militants or are exposed to arbitrary detention and torture. At the same time, social engagement and civil society are active in Somalia, and have played an important role in providing local services and peace building.","Number of pages":"3","Capital":"Mogadishu","GDP (current $US million)":"","Income group":"Low income","Population":"15442905","Land Area (sq. km)":"637660","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"110.9","Freedom in the World Index":"7","Human Development Index":"","Global Peace Index":"3.30","Democracy Index":"","Regime Type":"","Corruption Perceptions Index":"12","GDP per capita (current US$)":"","1":"5.79","1.1":"4.45","1.2":"7.13","2":"1.67"},{"Corresp":"158","ISO-3":"ZAF","Country":"South Africa","ISO-2":"ZA","Continent":"Africa","Region":"Southern Africa","Flag file":"za.png","1.

Traffickers are known to recruit people from the poorer, rural areas to urban centres, where they are then forced into domestic servitude, sex trafficking and other forms of forced labour. There is also evidence of Mozambican, Zimbabwean, Basotho and Malawian migrants in forced labour arrangements. Labour exploitation is becoming recognised as a greater threat than sex trafficking. However, this is not criminally organized and mostly linked to the farming sector. ##&& A major corruption market in South Africa is associated with the movement of foreign nationals, predominantly related to paperwork and the process of crossing borders with a bribe, instead of a valid passport. Highly organized professional criminal networks and transactional cash-based networks run the human smuggling industry in South Africa. These groups are, however, not violent, and the criminal market still has significantly less reach than in other countries on the continent. The smuggling of undocumented foreign nationals into South Africa often takes place on buses or trucks crossing the border, a practice in which South African police and immigrations authorities are often complicit.","text - trade":"A significant flow of arms exists within the country. These firearms are overwhelmingly used by criminals to kill, injure, and intimidate. There are a variety of sources that have fuelled the pool of illegal firearms including the flow of arms from outside South Africa and within the country. Additionally, the long history of the apartheid regime led to the heavy arming of civilians. Weapons have also historically been smuggled across the borders from neighbouring countries. While recent figures suggest there has been a decrease in this cross-border trade, it\u2019s still taking place, albeit to a lesser degree. ##&& The flow of arms has also been influenced by more recent local sources including weapons stolen or lost by legitimate firearm owners and weapons siphoned off from state institutions. The assassination in September 2020 of Lieutenant-Colonel Charl Kinnear, a high-ranking police officer who was investigating a \u2018guns-to-gangs\u2019 scandal implicating senior police officials and powerful gang members, shone a light not only on the endemic corruption plaguing South Africa\u2019s firearms registry, but also on the entrenched links between corrupt members of the country\u2019s law enforcement institutions and the criminal underworld.","text - environment":"Illegal logging is not considered a prominent issue in South Africa, apart from small-scale theft of timber from commercial plantations and in rural communities. However, South Africa is considered a consumer of illegal timber from other countries in the region, notably Angola, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, and to an extent Mozambique. The country furthermore functions as a conduit for illegal timber, specifically hardwoods from Zimbabwe and Zambia to Chinese markets via the port of Durban. ##&& Fauna crimes are considerably more pervasive throughout South Africa. The poaching and trafficking of rhino horn is the most widely reported and prominent criminal market. However, there is also a growing range of other wildlife trafficking markets including lion bones, ivory, abalone, and pangolins. Abalone poaching provokes violence, via the gang activity surrounding the trade and has precipitated turf wars. Moreover, there is a close trafficking relationship between South Africa and Asia, predominantly pertaining to the illicit trade of lion, hippo and rhino products. ##&& Non-renewable resource crimes in South Africa are characterised predominantly by the illicit trade of gold and, to some extent, diamonds. The illegal gold mining industry has expanded significantly, with a clear differentiation emerging between gangs of miners who work in dangerous conditions and are subject to exploitation, and criminal networks purchasing and trafficking the products. South Africa has multiple other minerals-related vulnerabilities, including the illegal production and exportation of chrome and platinum group metals, mostly from mines in the north east. Aside from the environmental and economic impact of the illicit activity surrounding the mining sector in South Africa, there have been numerous assassinations of local residents who oppose mining developments in the region of KwaZulu-Natal since 2016. In addition to precious metals and gemstones, another prominent non-renewable resource crime that is prevalent in South Africa is fuel theft, which has increased exponentially over the past two years. While most of the stolen oil is sold domestically, a sizeable proportion is smuggled out of South Africa into neighbouring countries where the price of fuel is higher.","text - drugs":"South Africa is both a destination and trans-shipment point for Afghan heroin arriving directly via sea and air routes, and indirectly via overland routes originating in East Africa. South Africa stands out as a major transit country because it is easier for traffickers to move containers to Europe from South Africa than it is from other countries in the region. There is strong evidence that the heroin market is growing and becoming increasingly fatal for users. The trade is controlled by organized criminal groups originating in South Africa, and Southern and West Africa, with direct links to South Asian networks. Border, customs, and police officials are reportedly involved in facilitating the distribution of the drug, and transit through the country. With regard to cocaine, the amount consumed and trafficked has grown significantly. In particular, South Africa has become a trans-shipment zone for cocaine from Andean suppliers en route to Europe and Middle Eastern markets. While crack cocaine use grew rapidly in the country in the 1990s, since 2000, the domestic market for cocaine has largely stabilized, as synthetic drugs and heroin have become more prominent. ##&& Domestic cannabis production and cultivation is high, as it is the most commonly consumed drug in the country. South Africa is also a source country for cannabis to regional markets as well as trans-shipment via regional neighbours to other destination markets in West and North Africa. The country's \u2018Durban Poison\u2019, a cannabis strain, has global brand recognition. Domestic and regional organized criminal groups facilitate this trade, in conjunction with corrupt state security officials, via air, land and sea routes. Notably, the low value to weight ratio makes cannabis unattractive for illicit traders next to commodities like cocaine, amphetamine, or Mandrax. Historically, Mandrax was the dominant synthetic drug in South Africa. However, since the 2000s, other drugs have undercut its dominance, yet it is still prevalent in many of the poorer communities across the country. Moreover, since 2003, the consumption of crystal methamphetamine, commonly referred to as \u2018tik\u2019, began in Cape Town and quickly took hold of drug markets in many poor communities.","text - criminal actors":"Mafia-style groups drive high crime rates, particularly in regard to drugs and extortion, and to a lesser extent, environmental crime. While termed gangs, these groups are easily identifiable with known leaders and with membership concentrated in major cities. Moreover, these groups are well armed, and there is a high level of violence associated with their operations. These gangs are arranged in two broad alliances, the 26s and the 28s. The assassination of a 28s boss, and one of the country\u2019s most powerful gang leaders, Ernie \u2018Lastig\u2019 Solomon, in November 2020 was another milestone in the power shift from the crime bosses of the 1980s and 1990s to a new generation of gang leaders. Mafia-style violence and organizations are also present in the mini-bus taxi industry, a significant generator of criminal violence. By the beginning of 2020, targeted killings of individuals operating in the taxi industry in South Africa had reached unprecedented levels. Many gangs operating in South Africa, particularly in Cape Town, were strengthened by the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdown measures, capitalizing on the alcohol and cigarette bans, as well as on the increased marginalization and vulnerability of communities who took a severe economic hit, to strengthen their hold over local populations. ##&& South Africa also has quasi-criminal style networks, termed \u2018syndicates\u2019 locally, with significant transnational links. Their activities are associated with moderate to high levels of violence and focus on a variety of criminal pursuits. There are high, middle, and lower-level state actors in all criminal markets in South Africa. Pervasive corruption exists within many of the different state departments, including at senior levels within the police, prosecution, and prison services. Meanwhile, South Africa is a prominent settlement destination for foreign criminal actors, particularly from Nigeria, China, Pakistan, Israel and southern and eastern European nations. These actors are concentrated in major cities, though none have complete control over specific markets. ","text - leadership and governance":"South Africa\u2019s overall trend over the last 13 years (2002\u20132020) is one of worsening instability. However, the recent moves by the current government to crack down on corruption involving the political elite, coupled with the work being done by the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture must be seen as positive moves. The current government is also considering the establishment of a body with investigative powers to deal with cases of corruption. And, in 2020, the ruling party decided to back the president in the establishment of a permanent agency tasked with combating white-collar crime, organized crime and corruption. ##&& South Africa has standards and systems for international cooperation in place. However, in the past considerable challenges have been reported in relation to international cooperation, extradition, and mutual legal assistance. There is evidence this may improve. On the domestic level, South Africa has robust anti-organized crime legislation and a strong overall legal framework. However, a persistent problem the country faces is with the implementation of this legal framework due to capacity issues and resource limitations. ","text - criminal justice and security":"Evidence suggests that judges are independent and generally free from corruption in South Africa. The prosecution service, however, has developed a reputation for a lack of capacity, corruption, and mismanagement. The current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has made new appointments that are widely seen as a move to clean up the prosecution services. However, possible budget cuts linked to the impact of COVID-19 could undermine these efforts. Violence, and threats thereof, against lawyers is also considered to be a threat to the integrity of the country\u2019s judicial system. ##&& In regard to law enforcement, South Africa has a single national police service, which is controlled nationally with structures in each of the nine provinces. The South African police are encouraged to prioritize drug-related arrests which has had the effect of putting extreme pressure on the country\u2019s court system. Although the police were remilitarized in 2010 in an effort to combat crime, the move resulted instead in the service becoming less transparent and accountable. In addition, the police have experienced serious problems related to management, in-fighting, and corruption. Greater powers accorded to police during the COVID-19 lockdown have, in some instances, given more scope for corrupt officers to exploit and extort communities. ##&& As for its territorial integrity, South Africa has several points of entry and land crossings that are porous. This makes the country an attractive route for illicit trafficking. However, in 2020, the Border Management Authority Act was signed into operation, with the goal of establishing a single implementing entity under one executive authority.","text - economic and financial environment":"The formal market in South Africa is comparatively well regulated. South Africa also has an economic regulatory environment that is conducive to doing business, but while the informal economy is proportionately smaller than many other countries in the region, a significant proportion of the labour force works informally. South Africa is one of the countries hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which, together with school closures, has been an important facilitator of gang recruitment in the country\u2019s major crime hotspots. Furthermore, temporary bans on the sale of alcohol and cigarette during the pandemic created a major black market overnight, which gangs swiftly exploited. ##&& South Africa is a significant hotspot for money laundering, a significant proportion of which is intrinsically linked to the widespread corruption in the country. However, South Africa\u2019s anti-money laundering framework is among the most robust in Africa. South Africa\u2019s main anti-money laundering legislation was introduced in 2001, which also introduced the country\u2019s Financial Intelligence Centre, a professional, well-funded and relatively effective body. Vast improvements to the framework have been since 2017, including with regard to customer due diligence requirements, among other aspects.","text - civil society and social protection":"Given the scale of the challenge, drug users and their families report difficulties in accessing effective state services in South Africa. Most treatment and victim support services are run by civil society, with some also supported by municipal and provincial government bodies. Corruption within the criminal justice sector and fear of witness reprisals has had a negative impact on witness and victim support. Additionally, the government has an increasingly robust framework in place to provide support to victims of modern slavery. Meanwhile, several prevention strategies across a number of sectors, including gangs and environmental crime, are in place, including the National Crime Prevention Strategy, but often are not well-resourced or implemented. In November 2020, however, the government introduced a \u2018safer cities\u2019 concept aimed at reducing crime in cities across the country through various measures, including community policing and embracing the use of new technology. ##&& Civil society in South Africa is extremely vibrant, with non-state actors playing important roles in combating gang violence, and the drivers thereof, as well as other forms of organized crime. There is a free and active media in South Africa, with investigative journalists playing instrumental roles in exposing corruption and organized criminality in the country.

Perpetrators involved include both foreign and local businesspeople who recruit trafficked victims from the neighbouring countries of Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia. Additionally, camps for internally displaced people inside South Sudan are important recruiting grounds for traffickers. Not least of all, state corruption widely facilitates this criminal market. ##&& South Sudan is a source country for migrants and is located on the smuggling transit route towards North Africa and Europe. It is estimated that South Sudan hosts over 845 000 migrants, often travelling irregularly from the East and Horn of Africa. There is widespread displacement in broader regions, and the legacy of prolonged conflict in the country has meant that smuggling is a well-established practice, with a region-spanning infrastructure. Related to that, smuggling networks are often associated with other forms of crime as well and collaborate in some form or another with state officials.","text - trade":"Despite the implementation of UN and EU arms embargos to stop the flow of weapons into South Sudan, numerous countries from around the world allegedly supply weapons to various local groups. Weapons are also brought in lawfully through China, the EU and US. The ongoing conflict means there is an increasing demand for firearms and high levels of arms smuggling.

Notably, illegally harvested teak is trafficked to India. Foreign operators who bribe government officials and military personnel as well as rebels in return for protection drive the illicit teak trade. There are informal arrangements between foreign-owned firms and the local population in the felling and smuggling of timber. Deforestation rates in the country are high, caused by the heavy reliance on charcoal and fuelwood. Furthermore, estimates point to around 80% of felled trees in South Sudan being used for charcoal or firewood. South Sudan is mainly a transit country for wildlife parts, but also a potential source country. The spread of unlicensed firearms has worsened poaching levels, while resources available to those combating the activity are scarce. The country has become a participant in the black market of pangolin scales and meat, facilitated by corrupt border officials. Juba International Airport has also been red-flagged for the trafficking of ivory. ##&& In South Sudan, illegal gold mining is a common practice among local populations and an estimated half a million people are financially dependent on mining. There are links between mining companies and members of the president\u2019s inner circle, who have used their control of the mineral sector to consolidate its grip on the country\u2019s state revenues. The market is highly susceptible to violent competition. Illicitly mined gold is increasingly being smuggled into the Ugandan and Kenyan market. Since the outbreak of conflict in the country, oil revenues have been diverted to finance the war and this has thwarted hopes that the country would benefit from its massive resource wealth. ","text - drugs":"Juba is a transit point for Brazilian heroin moved into Kenya by transnational drug trafficking syndicates.

Cannabis, on the other hand, is smuggled into South Sudan through border points in Nadapal and Nimule, and is the most profitable and prevalent drug in the nation. In 2017, South Sudan had one of their largest seizures, and the national police have acknowledged a rise in cannabis trafficking and consumption in recent years. Conversely, there is little evidence to suggest that structured illegal markets for cocaine and synthetic drugs exist in the country, but there have been sporadic seizures in the country.","text - criminal actors":"Criminal networks operate across a variety of illicit markets in South Sudan. They are usually well armed and violent. The most prominent \u2013 the Toronto Boys Gang and the Mob Gang, are well known and engage in theft and have links to business and political leaders. State-embedded actors are heavily involved in all criminal markets in South Sudan. Abuse of no-bid contracts is widespread, with such contracts often awarded with no control and at inflated prices to companies held by members of the ruling political class. Similarly, oversight over state spending in general is lacking. On the other hand, establishing a company in South Sudan involves an enormous amount of bureaucracy, which becomes a prerequisite for state officials to seeks bribes or acquire undocumented company shares. On a larger scale, state actors in South Sudan are actively involved in poaching and illicit mining activities. ##&& There is a large number of foreign actors, particularly Kenyans and Ugandans, involved in arms trafficking. In addition, there has been increasing foreign involvement through investment in the oil industry, involving different entities from China, the UK and Malaysia as well as trader networks originating in Kenya, Eritrea and Ethiopia. Foreign nationals are commonly arrested attempting to smuggle wildlife contraband out of the country and a shadowy Eritrean businessperson is said to control much of the illicit business in Juba. In 2018, a senior Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition official blamed the government for operating like a mafia syndicate alongside as many as 14 militia groups who often camouflage as opposition parties. These factions are often in violent conflict with each other for territory and control of resources. Mafia-style groups aligned with rebel and government actors control extractive industries and are involved in illicit economic practices.

The economic crisis and hyperinflation have driven up levels of crime, official large-scale waste, misappropriation and mismanagement have been reported and trust in government is very low. South Sudan ranks among the most fragile states globally and the government cannot provide a good quality of life. South Sudan is reportedly also among the most corrupt countries worldwide. Moreover, the high levels of corruption are likely to deepen the economic crisis in the country. Additionally, the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan found that high-ranking government officials were implicated in the supply of heavy military-grade weapons to local militia. South Sudanese elite politicians and members of the military compete to buy homes and invest in Nairobi and Kampala, which serve as second homes and safe havens. Lucrative contracts are often handed to suppliers connected to government officials. ##&& While Sudan participates in several international conventions such as the Eastern Africa Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and the East African Community (EAC), it has not adopted key transnational crime frameworks, creating an incoherence that leads to misinterpretations and undermines anti-crime efforts. South Sudan was recently removed from the African Union for failing to pay its annual subscription, and the EAC is also threatening to remove the country for the same reason. The lack of formal agreements covering repatriation is one reason why child migrants have been detained without trials. Along with extending the arms embargo on South Sudan, the United Nations Security Council has extended a travel ban and financial sanctions. ##&& Although the country has a narrow definition of trafficking in persons, certain paragraphs of its Penal Code, Child Act and the Labour Act criminalize trafficking practices. Furthermore, in December 2019, a Taskforce on Anti-Human Trafficking was created, which makes policy decisions and advises on migration and deportation. The country has a draft National Comprehensive Migration Policy, however the ability of the government to enforce its policies is almost non-existent, due to its lack of political control outside of Juba.","text - criminal justice and security":"The institutional capacity of the justice sector remains low and corruption is widespread. The weak rule of law means that even officials found guilty of corruption are unlikely to face sanctions. Access to justice is poor, and human rights are far from protected.

Evidence of crime is not well preserved, and evidence tampering is common. Law enforcement officers receive much criticism from the president and the population for being violent. Over 90% of the police are illiterate, training is woefully lacking, most officers are approaching retirement age and no effort has been made to include women. The police presence in rural areas is limited or absent and many people see the police service as the perpetrators of crime and human-rights abuses. Legal frameworks in Southern Sudan are unclear or absent and residents of the capital pay police to unofficially patrol their neighbourhoods, as the government is unable to pay police members\u2019 salaries. ##&& Official recognition of the border with Sudan is currently based on the 1956 alignment. There is extensive smuggling especially in the south and through Juba International Airport, and the borders with Uganda and Kenya are especially vulnerable to traffickers.

US dollars are quite popular in South Sudan\u2019s black market, much of it laundered, though economic experts claim the money do not reach the Central Bank. Despite growing international concern around corruption, there is only limited international effort to block the avenues of money laundering. ##&& Industry and infrastructure are highly underdeveloped in South Sudan, formal markets are disorganized, property rights are insecure and the informal economy is large. South Sudan lacks the framework to enforce judgements on economic matters and most commercial disputes are solved informally. Inflation rates are high and doing business in South Sudan is extremely difficult. Almost the entire revenue of South Sudan comes from crude oil exports, which have been steadily declining in recent years.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim and witness support is not available in South Sudan and the social stigma and fear of a punitive legal system prevents many cases from being reported. As of now, no legislation or policies are set in place to prevent victims from being prosecuted for offences they have been compelled to commit. Additionally, law enforcement do not have established mechanisms to aid with the identification of potential victims of trafficking. The government does not provide legal assistance or other mechanisms to victims of organized crime. Thus, South Sudan fails to meet the set requirements for the elimination of trafficking of human beings. The Ministry of Interior established a taskforce on human trafficking and smuggling in December 2019, and the government cooperated with the National Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Commission to release more than 300 child soldiers. ##&& While the number of NGOs is growing in South Sudan, their impact is limited, although they have played a significant role in stemming state involvement and orchestration of organized crime. Civil society is often under threat and the opposition continues to be targeted, intimidated and censored. The freedom of the media is highly restricted in South Sudan \u2013 at least 10 journalists have been killed since 2014.

Victims in Sudan originate mostly in the West, East or the Horn of Africa, and are forced into domestic servitude, prostitution and debt bondage. Often, human trafficking victims begin their journeys consensually, before being exploited by traffickers. Notably, migrant children are especially at-risk to exploitation in mining and farming as well as to sexual exploitation. In terms of perpetrators, organized criminal networks facilitate trafficking through cell-based networks that pass victims between various nodes. ##&& Sudan is a major human smuggling hub, moving people towards North Africa and the Gulf. Smuggled migrants include Somali, Syrian and Yemeni nationals fleeing conflict and seeking migration into Europe. Individual smugglers and criminal groups engaging in human smuggling maintain strong links to the state. Most human smuggling networks use land routes in the Sahel, crossing highly militarized borders where migrants are vulnerable to predatory nomadic groups. The high levels of smuggling that occur are linked to corrupt state-embedded actors, predominantly low-level officials who work within border regions. Although many smugglers operating in Sudan are Sudanese, a significant number are Eritrean and Ethiopian.","text - trade":"Sudan is awash with weapons, largely due to the Sudanese government taking advantage of armed tribes to fight opposition groups by proxy. The armed struggle between Sudan and South Sudan triggered the heavy importation of armaments into the country, which have remained in circulation. Sudan has violated the UN arms embargo by reportedly providing three deliveries of weapons to resupply its security forces, and Sudanese arms traffickers are known to have also violated arms embargoes on the Central African Republic (CAR) by supplying weapons to Muslim rebels.","text - environment":"Although there is no evidence of an established illicit flora trade in Sudan, spillover from the illicit logging and charcoal trades in South Sudan is likely to exist. Conversely, Sudan is a transit hub for the illicit ivory trade. Ivory tusks are often smuggled into Sudan from the CAR, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and northern Gabon by a group of Sudanese horsemen, known as the Janjaweed Militia. Reports from the Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce and the Uganda Wildlife Authority suggest that ivory is increasingly smuggled through Sudan because of its lax legislation that enables traffickers. The decline of elephant populations in neighbouring South Sudan has reportedly triggered an increase in ivory prices. South Sudan, Uganda and the DRC exploit Sudan\u2019s porous borders to traffic pangolins, and Sudanese pro-government militias are involved in poaching in the neighbouring CAR. However, little poaching exists on Sudanese territory, as nearly all Sudanese fauna have been decimated. ##&& Sudan is a source and transit country for the illicit trade of non-renewable resources. Gold is smuggled out of the country via organized criminal networks or laundered through government parastatals and has been directly linked to high levels of corruption and violence in Darfur. Gold smuggled out of the Sahel and CAR transits through Sudan and, in addition, illicit oil siphoning also serves as a major source of criminal income.","text - drugs":"Sudan is one of the largest producers of cannabis in Africa and consumption is widespread. Cannabis is also smuggled out of Sudan to the Arabian Peninsula. Cannabis cultivation, consumption and trade are culturally established practices in Sudan, which operate as an informal industry rather than a criminal market. In 2015, cannabis cultivation in Sudan generated over 7 billion USD in profits and in 2019, Sudan reported the seizure of over 16 000 cannabis crops. The consumption of psycho-active substances in Sudan, particularly prescription drugs such as Tramadol and Captagon, has significantly increased over the last decade, with the latter reportedly being since recently produced in the country. Popular among university students, the drugs are smuggled into Sudan where they are sold in pharmacies. While Sudan's government has acknowledged an increase in illicit prescription drugs, amphetamines and opioids remain uncommon due to their cost. ##&& Due to the high cost of obtaining heroin, both trafficking and consumption are relatively uncommon. Nevertheless, small quantities of heroin are reportedly trafficked into Sudan from neighbouring countries such as Egypt. Sudan serves as a transit point for cocaine trafficked from South American source countries to the Arabian Peninsula, alongside small amounts from neighbours such as Egypt. ","text - criminal actors":"Reportedly, state-embedded actors in Sudan are the most prominent criminal actor type in the country. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) primarily comprises former Janjaweed militias and has links to other mafia-style groups in Sudan. Corrupt Sudanese police and border guards facilitate human trafficking, enabling the transportation of victims through security checkpoints and across international borders without intervention. Criminal networks operate in Sudan on a loose and uncoordinated basis and play a crucial role in drug and human trafficking. Human traffickers often have tribal ties to the Rashaida and Tabo tribes. Sudanese nomadic Fulani cattle herders also reportedly engage in wildlife crimes in the CAR, in particular through poaching giant eland and buffalo for bushmeat. While some armed actors have joined the transitional government, state control in areas in which criminal networks operate remains limited. ##&& Foreign actors, predominantly Libyans, work with Sudanese human traffickers, moving victims through Libya and Egypt and onto Europe. Criminal actors from the CAR and South Sudan are involved in smuggling illicit goods over Sudan\u2019s borders. Since the outbreak of war in Syria, a network of Sudanese elites has targeted Syrian refugees by establishing an illicit market for Sudanese passports, enabling foreign criminal actors to both enter and flourish in Sudan. Sudanese mafia groups attempt to maintain high levels of control over their territories, consolidated via extortion, and usually express explicit pro- or anti-government sentiment. Mafia groups are involved in abductions, looting and cross-border smuggling and trafficking of goods and people as a means to finance their armed political activities. The groups are particularly active in the Darfur region and are known to recruit children.","text - leadership and governance":"Following Al-Bashir\u2019s ousting, where laws were passed by decree, Sudan is attempting to transition into democracy. The obvious failure of the government to meaningfully address organized crime appears to be due to a lack of political will, corruption and inadequate legislative and legal infrastructure. Furthermore, the army remains influential in politics and dominant in the economy, which makes reforms even more difficult. Sudan is a highly vulnerable and unstable country, experiencing 16 separate coup attempts in its history, six of which were successful. The Bashir regime has left Sudan with deeply entrenched corruption, a weak rule of law and very poor transparency and accountability. Sudan is among the countries boasting the highest corruption perception globally, and access to information is extremely poor. ##&& Sudan has ratified most relevant international treaties pertaining to transnational organized crime. Some efforts have been made to cooperate with countries falling in the migration route between the Horn of Africa and Europe. Sudan, however, is in violation of international arms law with its practices in South Sudan and it is sometimes an unwilling and uncooperative international partner. Sudan only has a limited legislative framework to combat organized crime. The African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies has called for the transitional government to improve human trafficking legislation to allow authorities to better define and tackle the practice. Sudan has cybercrime legislation in place and a committee to introduce strict measures against illegal gold and currency smuggling. In July 2020, the transitional government published The Law of Various Amendments Abolishing and Amending Provisions Restricting Freedom, which while not directly tackling organized crime markets, is relevant for advancing human rights and citizenship rights in the country.","text - criminal justice and security":"Sudan lacks specialized judicial units tasked with countering organized crime and although the constitution guarantees an independent judiciary, the judiciary is in practice influenced by either the Sudanese president or security forces. Judicial appointments are made by members of the ruling party, and judges who fail to support the state are easily removed, making it difficult for judges to provide independent rulings in cases involving the state. While Sudan\u2019s Ministry of Justice under the transitional government has reportedly made some attempts at reform, the judiciary continues to lack the capacity and resources to effectively counter organized crime. ##&& Organized criminal actors have largely captured law enforcement and use it to repress any efforts to fight against organized crime. Sudanese authorities lack the necessary resources to confront organized crime networks, and regularly use pro-government militias who are themselves engaged in trafficking activities. Law enforcement efforts directed at human trafficking and smuggling have reportedly been outsourced to the Rapid Response Fund, who have also been accused of abuse and impunity. Nevertheless, the Sudanese Armed Forces launched a unit to protect children in war zones and trained over 5 000 military officials to help at-risk children. ##&& Sudan\u2019s border is extremely long and difficult to monitor and police, making it highly porous as a consequence. As the Sudanese government lacks the necessary resources to prevent cross-border crime, it resorts to using state of emergency and border closures to gain control. It is easy for vehicles to enter the country illegally from Libya and the CAR without being detected. The latter are used to carry out other forms of transnational crime, including illegal mining. It is also important to note that as the border between Sudan and South Sudan is yet to be determined, the territorial integrity of both countries is weakened.","text - economic and financial environment":"In 2015, Sudan was removed from the Financial Action Task Force blacklist following the country\u2019s adoption of a law to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. The country has consolidated both financial investigations and intelligence through information-sharing mechanisms between financial institutions. The Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force assesses Sudan as largely compliant with all their core recommendations, however, implementation remains a challenge, and Sudan continues to lobby for the removal of terrorism-related sanctions. ##&& Moreover, Sudan\u2019s poor economy and the significant differences between the Central Bank and black-market exchange rates likely perpetuate the illicit flow of funds in Sudan. The country lacks an efficient economic regulatory regime and operates with a largely informal economy. Unstable governance, rigid labour markets and an incredibly weak rule of law hinder economic diversification. Sudan performs poorly in areas of regulatory quality and the ease of doing business due to poor economic protections.","text - civil society and social protection":"Sudanese authorities fail to provide support to both drug users and human trafficking victims. The latter are often subjected to criminal penalties for crimes committed while being trafficked and there is a lack of measures to identify sex trafficking victims. The RSF has allegedly engaged in child soldiering and yet there have been no reports of official investigations. Indicative of the dire situation in relation to victim support is the fact that Sudan reportedly only meets 2% of the mechanisms identified to aid victims in exiting modern slavery. The country\u2019s most common tool to attempt to combat organized crime appears to be border closures and state of emergency, which demonstrates a far more reactive approach to organized crime rather than a preventative one. The Sudanese government puts forth minimal effort to prevent corruption among state-embedded officials and due to a lack of resources, Sudanese authorities also often rely on criminally involved pro-government militias to enforce their policies. However, improvements have been made by the transitional government to resolve unclear divisions of responsibility between human trafficking organizations and to improve capacity for coordination of anti-trafficking mechanisms. ##&& The Sudanese transitional government continues to regard and treat civil society organizations (CSOs) in the country as government opposition. Moreover, security officials under the former regime cracked down on CSOs in response to peaceful protests. Although press freedoms are extremely poor in Sudan, they have improved under the transitional government. Reporters Without Borders indicate that the former Sudanese regime was exceptionally hostile to press freedom and resorted to harassment, censorship, seizures, closures and internet cuts to control the press. The National Intelligence and Security Service reportedly employed the most brutal methods to silence dissent, and it is unclear how much more this will improve under the new government.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Khartoum","GDP (current $US million)":"30513.46","Income group":"Low income","Population":"42813238","Land Area (sq. km)":"1854105","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"105.2","Freedom in the World Index":"17","Human Development Index":"0.51","Global Peace Index":"3.04","Democracy Index":"2.54","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"16","GDP per capita (current US$)":"442","1":"6.47","1.1":"5.55","1.2":"7.38","2":"2.96"},{"Corresp":"171","ISO-3":"TZA","Country":"Tanzania","ISO-2":"TZ","Continent":"Africa","Region":"East Africa","Flag file":"tz.png","1.

The most common forms of trafficking are forced labour and sexual exploitation, often orchestrated by businesspeople who traffic individuals from rural areas, forcing them to work in the informal commercial sector, on farms, in quarries and mines, as well as on fishing fleets in the high seas. Individuals close to the victims are largely complicit in domestic trafficking. However, mostly cartel-type gangs operating in border and port towns control transnational trafficking of persons. There are also indications that perpetrators also traffic handicapped children from Tanzania into Kenya. ##&& Over the past decade, Tanzania has emerged as a key transit country for migrants being smuggled from Central and Eastern Africa en route to Southern Africa. People from neighbouring countries may also seek refuge in Tanzania. In particular, over the past few years, there has been an increasing number of irregular migrants entering Tanzania through porous border points from Rwanda and Burundi. Smugglers moving individuals also heavily rely on the border crossings between Kenya and Tanzania. Human smuggling networks are fairly well developed in Tanzania and operate as loose networks, rather than highly hierarchical structures. The government\u2019s relative disinterest in the issue of human smuggling in Tanzania has meant that smuggling networks operate with fairly few obstacles. The issue of human smuggling has also been exacerbated by corrupt practices within law enforcement of both Tanzania and neighbouring countries.","text - trade":"Although Tanzania is a relatively stable country, it still suffers from small arms proliferation. Tanzania\u2019s long and porous borders with neighbouring countries experiencing conflict and instability to a certain degree expose it to arms trafficking. Thus, the regions in Tanzania that are most affected by the illegal arms trade are the border regions, including Kagera, Kigoma, Rukwa and Katavi. Notably, poor border security and corruption among law enforcement at the country\u2019s borders facilitate illegal arms flows.","text - environment":"Illegal logging is a serious problem in Tanzania. Illegally felled wood is both exported abroad and used for the manufacturing of charcoal for local and regional consumption. The criminal networks engaging in illegal logging are well organized, well armed and in many cases are involved in other forms of organized criminal activity with links to other transnational organized crime groups in neighbouring countries, as well as in Asia. Furthermore, corruption is pervasive among Tanzania\u2019s forestry system, and bribes are often paid to forest officials or local police officers to solicit their help in carrying out illegal logging. ##&& Fauna crimes are also pervasive in Tanzania, as the country is host to a large population of animals that are poached and trafficked. Tanzania is a key ivory and pangolin scales transit country, as well as a source country for other wildlife products such as reptile skins, rhino horn and hippo teeth. The port of Dar es Salaam is one of the country\u2019s primary transport hubs through which illegal wildlife products exit the country. There are close ties between trafficking networks in Tanzania and Asian consumer markets and evidence suggests that there are fairly high levels of violence associated with the illegal wildlife trade in Tanzania. ##&& In regard to non-renewable resource crimes, gold and tanzanite are the two most trafficked minerals out of Tanzania. Furthermore, while there have been several recent arrests of high-ranking police and local government officials for their involvement in the illicit economy, there have been few, if any, convictions, which suggests a certain degree of impunity.","text - drugs":"Tanzania plays a central role in the regional heroin trade, both as a transit and destination country. While much of the heroin entering the country is transported from the coast of Pakistan, Tanzania is also a major entry point for Afghan heroin transiting through Africa via air routes. The heroin is then moved inland through the country. Notably, Tanzanian trafficking networks are major players in the regional heroin trade. These criminal networks have strong connections to organized criminal groups both in Asia and Europe. Heroin is often exchanged with cocaine travelling in the opposite direction. However, overall, Tanzania is not a large hub in the transnational cocaine trade. ##&& With respect to cannabis, Tanzania records widespread cannabis use and is thought to have the highest number of cannabis smokers in East Africa. Cannabis is cultivated in the country, primarily in the regions of Arusha, Tanga and Mara. Along with supplying a considerable domestic market, Tanzania plays an important role as a supplier of cannabis to neighbouring countries. Corrupt practices among officials contribute to the ubiquity of the cannabis market in Sudan. Similar to cocaine, the synthetic drugs trade is a comparably smaller market. Nevertheless, Tanzania does play a role as a transit country for methamphetamine coming from Asia and neighbouring Kenya, destined for other Asian countries and the Southern African market. Given the small size of the synthetic drug market, many of the criminal networks involved in the trade focus on other drugs or other forms of organized crime, such as wildlife crime, as their principal markets.","text - criminal actors":"The picture of national criminal networks in Tanzania is fairly opaque. However, there are a number of criminal networks operating in the country in an array of illicit economies. Local networks act as facilitators in the illegal ivory trade and in the illegal logging sector. Tanzanian organized crime figures are increasingly prevalent in leadership roles in other countries, including poachers and illegal wildlife smugglers in Mozambique, and heroin trafficking networks in South Africa, as well as other drug networks operating in India. The ability of these criminal actors to operate transnationally suggests a fairly high level of organization. Furthermore, there are considerable links between these criminal networks, state actors and actors in the formal economy. There are a number of foreign actors that are also known to contribute significantly to the organized crime landscape in Tanzania, including criminal groups from West Africa and Southern Africa, as well as from Asia. Criminal actors from Eastern Asia are most heavily involved in environmental illicit economies. Furthermore, elements from Italian organized crime groups have a longstanding presence on the island of Zanzibar. ##&& In Tanzania, there have been a significant number of assassinations and violent acts carried out by criminal actors who appear to enjoy protection from the state. At the same time, the number of prosecutions of opposition figures in the country and attacks on human-rights defenders and journalists perpetrated by state actors have increased in prominence, suggesting a certain degree of collusion between criminal actors and state-embedded actors in Tanzania. Territorial, mafia-style groups are not a prominent feature of the organized crime landscape in Tanzania. The closest criminal elements to mafia-style groups that exist in Tanzania are gangs in urban areas. However, these groups rarely exhibit violence and their leaders are often businesspeople in the formal economy.","text - leadership and governance":"Under the current administration, organized crime has been placed high on the agenda, in large part due to the desire to make a visible break from a past overwhelmed by criminal enterprise. At lower and mid-levels of government, this rhetoric has been reflected in action, and law enforcement patrols and crackdowns on street economies have increased under the current government. However, there have been no convictions of government figures involved in organized crime. Similarly, only low-level actors in the drug trade have been arrested and convicted, while major Tanzanian player have stayed out of the spotlight. At the same time, the rhetoric of the \u2018fight against organized crime\u2019 obscures the crackdown on vulnerable people, civil society and opposition figures. The Tanzanian government has also pursued a harsh anti-corruption drive in recent years, evident in the number of high-level court cases and the dismissal of several public officials. Nevertheless, democratic standards pertaining to media freedom and political expression have declined considerably in recent years and repressive measures against opposition and journalists have increased. ##&& On the international level, Tanzania has ratified a number of international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. Furthermore, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with Kenya in 2015 on the issue of illegal logging, but it has only been partially implemented. Moreover, a trilateral agreement has been established with South Africa and Mozambique pertaining to collaboration on the issue of the transnational drug trade between the three countries. Overall, the Tanzanian government is seen as reticent to engage with regional and international bodies. This reluctance to engage substantially in international cooperation is to the detriment of the country\u2019s ability to tackle organized criminal activity. On the domestic level, Tanzania has more pieces of legislation pertaining to organized crime than almost any other African nation, covering drug trafficking, arms trafficking, human trafficking, as well as wildlife and environmental crimes. In terms of enforcement, state actions and decisions have been effective, but they are likely to be seen as knee-jerk and unlikely to go beyond Tanzanian borders to deal with illicit activities in a suitable manner.","text - criminal justice and security":"Overall, low-level corruption in Tanzanian courts is prevalent and the independence of the judiciary from the executive is slowly but surely waning. The government crackdown on corrupt officials in recent years has been somewhat successful in reducing the pervasiveness of corrupt practices in the judicial system. At the same time, the court has an extremely broad definition of economic crime, and over the past year, the judiciary has been operationalized to silence journalists. Furthermore, half of the prison population in Tanzania are pre-trial detainees or remand prisoners, suggesting a sluggishness in processing court cases in the country. ##&& In regard to law enforcement, Tanzania\u2019s law enforcement bodies have taken strong action on organized criminal activity under the new government. However, police units are still in need of further resources and advanced technology. At the same time, corruption and impunity in the Tanzanian police force are deemed to be pervasive, and low salaries for police officers is a key driver of corruption. Additionally, Tanzania\u2019s borders are long and porous, and difficult to police, especially the extensive coastline. Communities living near the country\u2019s land borders conduct cross-border business, agriculture and cattle grazing and move freely. Naturally, smugglers have taken advantage and exploit this free movement of people. Corruption among border officials is also an issue, which facilitates organized criminal activity.","text - economic and financial environment":"While Tanzania\u2019s economy has experienced a strong macroeconomic performance over the past six years, the country's economy has been much more volatile since 2018 compared to previous years. While the government has taken a number of radical stances on the economy, it appears to lack the ability for more fine-grained regulation. Moreover, Tanzanian economic regulatory capacity is not conducive to doing business effectively, which incentivizes citizens to engage in the illicit economy instead. The Tanzanian government has made strides towards improving its anti-money laundering framework over the past decade, but several deficiencies remain. More specifically, such related to civil asset forfeiture and the execution of mutual legal assistance requests. Furthermore, despite several high-level arrests on charges related to money laundering, only a few convictions have been secured.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim and witness support in Tanzania is extremely poor, in particular with regard to victims of human trafficking. While the government took steps to implement a witness protection programme, more work remains to be done towards the programme\u2019s full integration, which serves to deter victims from appearing in court to testify. There is also very little evidence to suggest that the Tanzanian government offers much in the way of support to drug users in the country. In general, civil-society groups solely implement harm reduction programmes. Although an anti-trafficking fund was approved in 2019, the country has so far failed to operationalize it, which serves as an example of the gaps in the prevention of organized crime. ##&& At the same time, since 2015, the civil-society environment in Tanzania has been highly constrained. Moreover, the government has introduced repressive legislation restricting freedom of expression online. Similarly, the freedom of the media has also been restricted, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, when a number of journalists and outlets were sanctioned for their reporting on the coronavirus crisis.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Dodoma","GDP (current $US million)":"63177.07","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"58005463","Land Area (sq. km)":"947300","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"79.3","Freedom in the World Index":"34","Human Development Index":"0.53","Global Peace Index":"1.85","Democracy Index":"5.10","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"38","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1122","1":"6.15","1.1":"6.55","1.2":"5.75","2":"4.04"},{"Corresp":"174","ISO-3":"TGO","Country":"Togo","ISO-2":"TG","Continent":"Africa","Region":"West Africa","Flag file":"tg.png","1.

Trafficking within the country occurs more frequently than cross-border trafficking flows, with children identified as making up the majority of victims. Trafficked Togolese girls within the country often end up carrying out domestic work, serve as market vendors, and\/or are sexually exploited. Although less frequently, girls are also trafficked to other countries on the continent for the same forms of exploitation. Meanwhile, Togolese boys most commonly fall victim to being trafficked abroad to work in agriculture and construction sectors, primarily to other African countries. Children from Ghana and Benin have also been reportedly trafficked to Togo. There are reports of Togolese women and girls being trafficked to the Middle East for domestic work and sexual exploitation. Most exploitation is mainly a result of economic need, and therefore the market tends to be ad hoc and opportunistic. ##&& The socio-political unrest in Togo and the rising unemployment led many people, mainly the youth, to leave Togo as irregular migrants, seeking better fortune in other African nations. Some also made their way to Europe, taking routes along Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali, Algeria and Libya.

Unrest in the country in recent years may have resulted in increased accumulation of small arms and light weapons.","text - environment":"The recent decade saw an upsurge of illegal exploitation of rosewood from Togo in Chinese markets, which resulted in a government-imposed 10-year moratorium, temporary suspending authorizations to log the species on Togolese national territory. Criminal gangs operating in Togo's neighbouring countries also fell timber, trafficking the illegal commodity through the port of Lom\u00e9 to countries in South-eastern Asia. Moreover, timber shipments passing through Togo have been used as an obfuscation method to traffic several tons of illicit ivory and other wildlife products out of major ports. ##&& While poaching is not common in Togo, as its wildlife population is small, the country does serve as a transit zone for illegal wildlife products such as pangolin scales and elephant ivory from other countries in the region, typically destined for Asian markets. With regards to non-renewable resource crimes, there are instances of illegal gold mining, though it is not considered substantial as mostly impoverished farmers undertake illegal mining activities. However, Togo is an important gold trading centre because taxes on gold in the country are relatively negligible, and the country has become a major smuggling hub for gold from neighbouring countries.","text - drugs":"Due to its port, Togo has become, a hub for drug trafficking, including heroin to some degree. Heroin originates from countries such as Pakistan and Lebanon, but also Latin America. As heroin is a luxury drug consumed mostly by tourists, expatriate residents or wealthy nationals, most of the heroin that enters the country is re-exported towards the US or Europe. Often foreign nationals residing in Togo facilitate the trade and are assumed to have strong links with high-level state officials. Togo is also a transit country for cocaine, particularly in the north of the country. Similar to heroin, authorities in the country are suspected of being involved in the trade. ##&& While Togo is largely a transit corridor for cannabis, domestic cultivation is increasing. Many Nigerian nationals are involved in the market. Similarly, Togo is a transit hub for synthetic drugs, particularly at the port of Lom\u00e9. There is some evidence that Nigerian and Lebanese criminal groups are involved in the trafficking of synthetic drugs through Togo onto final destination markets.","text - criminal actors":"In Togo, many local criminal networks operate in narcotics trafficking, smuggling, contraband sales, endangered animal species (elephant tusks) and money laundering. Most of them serve as transporters for criminal and trafficking networks based in neighbouring countries or overseas. It is presumed that these networks have strong ties with state authorities. Corruption takes many forms and is often embedded in public and private sector practices in Togo, presenting a major challenge for economic growth in the country. Moreover, with the same regime reigning for more than 50 years, corruption is deeply rooted in state sectors, which leads to state-embedded actors being involved in drug trafficking and money laundering. ##&& Many foreign actors operate as part of criminal networks in Togo. Additionally, most drug networks in the country are connected with criminal actors from Latin America, Lebanon and Nigeria. Some of these foreign nationals are residents of the country and serve as a link between the network in Togo and markets abroad. Currently, there is no evidence of the presence of mafia-style criminal actors operating in Togo.","text - leadership and governance":"While the government has made verbal commitments to address corruption and established a new legal and institutional framework, the effectiveness and sincerity of these measures are yet to be proven. The culture of impunity in Togo encourages political crimes and corruption, which heavily impact the economy and state. The government has introduced some initiatives in order to increase transparency and accountability as well as the overall levels of cooperation with civil society. However, these initiatives are still too recent for adequate assessment to be carried out. ##&& On the international level, Togo closely cooperates with relevant international organizations and foreign governments in several sponsored programmes to effectively fight organized crime. Togo has also ratified a number of international instruments pertaining to countering organized crime and terrorism. Nevertheless, some state actors are suspected to have links with trafficking networks, which puts into question the extent to which these instruments are implemented. On the domestic level, the country has the necessary legal framework to combat organized crime and corruption. However, despite having two strategies aimed at tackling organized crime in place, the political will and the effective enforcement of existing laws remain a major challenge.","text - criminal justice and security":"Togo has improved its legal and institutional structures to combat organized crime, but the country lacks the enforcement of existing laws and the integrity of judicial authorities and law enforcement personnel, who are often corrupt or influenced by the executive branch, have been questioned. Additionally, a large proportion of the prison population in Togo is in pre-trial detainment, suggesting a slow processing of criminal cases through the judicial system. Togo does not have any specialized law enforcement units specifically dedicated to combating organized crime. With regard to territorial integrity, violence and insecurity in Togo are limited to its borders. At the same time, the country's borders are very porous. However, efforts are being made to strengthen the borders, by way of new strategies (new agencies, legal frameworks and training, among others), with the support of national and international partners.","text - economic and financial environment":"As with other countries in the region, Togo\u2019s tax policy is sometimes ambiguous, confusing and arbitrary. The country also demonstrates deficiencies in fostering an environment conducive to healthy business practices and economic growth. However, the government has improved efforts to enhance transparency and boost economic competitiveness, and the IMF, World Bank, European Union and other large donors continue to encourage reforms. Meanwhile, Togo also has all basic and necessary legal frameworks, and institutional structures related to anti-money laundering and financing of terrorism have been created. Their enforcement, however, remains a significant challenge.","text - civil society and social protection":"While Togo\u2019s government is lacking when it comes to responding to human trafficking, efforts have been made to address the problem, such as the deployment of several labour inspectors in the field. In addition, a green line was created to allow victims to contact an emergency unit providing care and shelter. Many NGOs also assist the government in providing care for victims of trafficking and dismantling criminal networks. With regard to witness protection, very little has been achieved as most witnesses are reporting anonymously. ##&& Since the 1990s, the relationship of civil-society organizations, the state and political actors has been characterized by distrust and suspicion. This was also evidenced in the socio-political turmoil in 2017\u20132018. Togo boasts an active media. However, public news service by the state media remains lacking. Additionally, press freedom is highly intertwined with the political environment in the country, and journalists tend to refrain from covering the government and the army in a negative light, in particular during election periods.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Lome","GDP (current $US million)":"5490.27","Income group":"Low income","Population":"8082366","Land Area (sq. km)":"56790","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"85.1","Freedom in the World Index":"43","Human Development Index":"0.52","Global Peace Index":"2.20","Democracy Index":"2.80","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"29","GDP per capita (current US$)":"679","1":"5.33","1.1":"4.90","1.2":"5.75","2":"4.00"},{"Corresp":"177","ISO-3":"TUN","Country":"Tunisia","ISO-2":"TN","Continent":"Africa","Region":"North Africa","Flag file":"tn.png","1.

Several cases of trafficking of Ivorian and Senegalese nationals as domestic workers have been reported. Such victims are allegedly brought to Tunisia through networks involving both nationals from countries of origin and Tunisian nationals. Cases of young women being trafficked to Gulf States for prostitution have also been reported. Domestic human trafficking does exist, involving predominantly young women and children from marginalized areas of the North West, trafficked either for domestic work or to become street beggars in the main cities of Tunisia. \u2018Samsaras\u2019, or brokers, act as intermediaries between the families of eventual victims of human trafficking and the families in richer cities looking for domestic helpers. ##&& Human smuggling is a longstanding but recently growing phenomenon in Tunisia. The problem mainly encompasses Tunisian nationals who try to reach Italian shores, as well as foreign migrants who transit through Tunisia on their way to Europe. Migration to Italy increased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, where reports highlighted that 4 000 Tunisians arrived irregularly in Italy in the month of July 2020 alone. Tunisia also acts as a transit country for sub-Saharan migrants who first come to Tunisia for work, then attempt to cross to Europe relying on Ivorian\u2013Tunisian smuggling networks. Additionally, Libyan smugglers have established launching points for trans-Mediterranean smuggling from Tunisian beaches in the east.","text - trade":"The 2011 revolution in Tunisia opened an avenue for the free flow of small and light weapons, where significant quantities of arms were trafficked from Libya to Tunisia, with regular seizures of assault rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers and hand grenades carried out by the authorities in the southern and north-western regions of the country. The existence of terrorist cells in the country and the perpetration of several terrorist attacks since 2011 is intertwined with the illegal circulation of weapons. While the number of seizures and attacks has significantly decreased in most of the country since 2016, in 2020 the Tunisian authorities announced that they dismantled an arms-trafficking network operating in the south of the country.","text - environment":"The illicit market for flora crime in Tunisia is not particularly pervasive. However, the illegal logging of cedar and fir by locals is common and is destroying a significant number of old-growth forests throughout the ecoregion. Meanwhile, the criminal market for fauna crimes in Tunisia primarily concerns the poaching, hunting and trafficking of protected birds, in addition to illegal fishing, overfishing and coral trafficking. Birds and other animals \u2013 such as goldfinches and turtles \u2013 have also been illegally taken from their natural habitat to be sold on local or international markets. Additionally, the African bustard is frequently the focus of illegal traditional hunts. Meanwhile, gazelle hunting and \u2018emir poaching\u2019, where Emirs from Arab countries spend months taking part in hunting activities seem to have decreased over time in Tunisia. ##&& The most prominent environmental criminal market, however, is that pertaining to non-renewable resource crime, in particular cross-border fuel smuggling. Due to price differentials stemming from oil subsidies in neighbouring countries, oil is systematically smuggled into Tunisia from Algeria, and to a lesser extent Libya, to be sold on the informal market. The illicit oil trade is a significant source of income for many communities, especially those living in border regions. In recent years, the economic marginalization of many of those living in border communities has increased substantially as the Tunisian economy has struggled, which, when combined with the complicity of government authorities, namely customs officials, is a key driver of the fuel smuggling market.","text - drugs":"Cannabis is the most consumed drug in Tunisia, and cannabis trafficking constitutes a significant market in the country. Cannabis resin is smuggled to Tunisia from Morocco, while transiting through Algeria. Tunisian networks spearhead the distribution of cannabis in the country, but Algerian and West African nationals are also involved in the importation of cannabis. Cross-border trafficking of cannabis between Tunisia, Libya and Algeria is a growing concern. Heroin with very low purity levels appears to mainly be consumed in the southern portion of Tunisia. Some cross-border trafficking occurs with neighbouring Libya and Algeria. However, Tunisian authorities have only seized small amounts of heroin and overall, the market is very limited. ##&& Meanwhile, the domestic cocaine market in Tunisia is limited but may be expanding. Cocaine in Tunisia appears to be derived from larger shipments, which move through the Maghreb and are evidenced by the multi-kilogram seizures made in recent years along Tunisia\u2019s coast. The market caters to wealthy consumers in major coastal cities, and most of the seizures are occurring in passenger seaports and airports, inbound from Europe. Investigations have revealed the implication of Brazilian, Tunisian and Italian criminal networks. In recent years, Tunisia has experienced an increase in Ecstasy seizures. Ecstasy originates from Europe, where the drug is trafficked by networks of European and Tunisian nationals. Subutex, a semi-synthetic opioid, has also gained popularity in Tunisia. Often, the drug is smuggled into the country by Tunisian nationals. The country\u2019s dynamic tourism industry provides both a cover and a potential market for such drugs.","text - criminal actors":"The 2011 revolution in Tunisia exposed large-scale corruption schemes at the highest levels of the state apparatus. Following the revolution, corruption became increasingly more apparent at the lower levels of the state. Overall, corruption is widespread, with citizens regularly paying bribes to law enforcement including police officers, customs agents and National Guard officers. Bribes are also frequently paid to administrative officials to facilitate or expedite the access to services normally provided by public institutions. The Tunisian border regions with Algeria and Libya constitute hubs for various forms of trafficking. The populations living in border regions travel regularly across the borders and often depend on trafficking and contraband of goods for revenue. For this reason, networks that traffic goods and contraband are not always considered criminal inside these regions. Instead, their members are often referred to as \u2018entrepreneurs\u2019. Human trafficking networks are composed of speculative \u2018samsaras\u2019 or brokers who act as intermediaries between families of minor girls from the North West of Tunisia and families from rich cities looking for domestic helpers. Samsaras usually come from the same regions as the girls they employ and operate either on their own or with the help of facilitators who establish the connection with the employers. ##&& Moreover, since the 2011 revolution and Libya\u2019s subsequent descent into conflict, some prominent foreign human smuggling groups have established themselves in Tunisia, offering alternative logistical and money laundering hubs for Libya-based operations. Currently, there is no evidence of mafia-style groups operating in Tunisia.","text - leadership and governance":"Political parties in Tunisia appear to put prevention and the fight against organized crime on their agenda on a case-by-case basis. The country still has no national crime prevention, anti-crime policy, or national crime prosecution policy. In recent years, the government launched a national campaign against corruption and contraband networks. This initiative has been criticized for using extra-judicial arrests and lacking efficiency. Overall, there is limited political will to address organized crime. ##&& On the international level, Tunisia has ratified most major international treaties pertaining to organized crime with the exception of the Arms Trade Treaty. Tunisia is an active member of the G7+7 and there is extensive cooperation in terms of intelligence sharing and police cooperation with the European Union. In comparison to certain neighbouring countries, such as Algeria and Morocco, Tunisia\u2019s bilateral cooperation on organized crime issues is less extensive. On the domestic level, Tunisia has a very robust legal framework pertaining to organized crime, including strong legislation related to drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering and human trafficking legislation.","text - criminal justice and security":"In Tunisia, judges are considered to be independent from political elites since the fall of the former regime in 2011. However, the judicial sector has a reputation of being overwhelmed by a heavy workload. Meanwhile, prisons in Tunisia are seen as a breeding ground for organized crime. In terms of law enforcement, the National Guard and the National Police force have had a tremendous increase in their capacities to tackle organized crime, thanks mostly to international assistance. However, competition between the two hinders the adequate management of investigations. Tunisia's borders with Algeria and Libya are porous, particularly in the years following the 2011 revolution. Since 2012, the mountains of Chaambi have been declared a military zone, with regular conflicts taking place between terrorist factions and the Tunisian army. Tunisia does not have the capacity to fully enforce its borders in this area and to prevent movements of terrorists across borders.","text - economic and financial environment":"Tunisia's formal economic sector is still recovering from the revolution, following decades of state capture and kleptocracy. In 2019, a transversal law on the business climate was enacted. The law aims to improve the investment climate by implementing several reforms related to the process of establishing a business, public\u2013private partnership and reducing bureaucracy for new businesses. However, the Tunisian economy was hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and many communities across the country are economically marginalized. As such, the Tunisian economy still heavily relies on the informal sector, in particular in the border regions neighbouring Algeria and Libya. ##&& Overall, Tunisia has been assessed very positively for its anti-money laundering efforts. In 2017, the EU Commission grey-listed the country as a non-cooperative jurisdiction in tax matters. To make matters worse, in 2018 Tunisia was blacklisted by the European Parliament as a country at risk of money laundering. Since then, however, the government has deployed efforts to foster international assistance for its banking and insurance sectors as well as institutions tasked with the monitoring and investigation of money laundering and financing of terrorism. Progress has been made and Tunisia was eventually taken off the blacklist in October 2019. ","text - civil society and social protection":"In Tunisia, all tribunals offer legal aid for civil and criminal cases. However, these services suffer from the heavy workload of the justice system. Meanwhile, there are no tangible crime prevention strategies or policies in Tunisia. Prevention strategies focusing on de-radicalization and youth are developed mostly by civil-society organizations and youth centres across the country, with the support of international organizations. Civil society is a vocal and active actor in many sectors, including security justice reform. A decree law adopted in 2011 protects media freedom. There is also an independent commission that supervises the audio-visual media in accordance with another decree law adopted in 2011.

Trafficking primarily takes the form of forced labour, sexual exploitation, recruitment for armed groups and forced begging. Many Ugandans who seek to migrate to countries in the Gulf, Asia or East Africa are vulnerable to deceptive practices by traffickers who guise as recruitment agencies. Inside Uganda, a high number of abducted children are known to be subject to some form of forced labour such as forced begging or prostitution. ##&& Uganda is a key human smuggling hub in East Africa. Corruption and the country\u2019s key geographic positioning render Uganda a haven for smugglers. While most labour migration recruitment agencies are legitimate and subject to government oversight, many cooperate with migrant smuggling networks and engage in document falsification, bribery or other criminal acts. Most irregular labour migration occurs from Uganda to the Middle East or Asia.","text - trade":"Uganda is believed to be a hub for arms trafficking across East, Central and West Africa. Although licenses are required to acquire, possess or transfer firearms or ammunition in Uganda, illegal gun ownership is widespread and rates of gun violence are high. These issues have been exacerbated by the historic conflicts between Uganda and neighbouring countries as well as leakage of arms owned by the security forces. Small arms trafficking, in particular, flourishes in areas and borderlands affected by conflicts between pastoralist and farming communities and conflicts in neighbouring countries. Uganda is also a source country for trafficked arms. A number of ammunition and small arms manufacturers operate domestically, with Luwero Industries being the largest. Supplies from these manufacturers have allegedly been trafficked to a range of actors in Africa, including Somali and Congolese militias. Nevertheless, arms trafficking is believed to have reduced in Uganda following the demobilization and relocation of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) abroad.","text - environment":"Uganda\u2019s environmental criminal markets are vast and pervasive. Large amounts of timber production in Uganda is illegal and the failure to comply with regulatory requirements, pay taxes or declare timber products is common. As a result of large-scale illicit logging, Ugandan forest cover has dropped substantially in recent decades and some tree species are now on the brink of extinction. Logs harvested may either be exported to foreign countries or used for charcoal production and export. In addition to being a source country for illegal flora crimes, illegally harvested timber from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is sometimes re-exported out of Uganda. Illicit timber smuggling in Uganda is believed to be, at least partly, controlled by criminal actors who simultaneously engage in gold smuggling and ivory smuggling across the region. Locals from poor communities, brokers who purchase timber and corrupt authorities alike profit from illicit logging in Uganda, while government officials have reportedly facilitated illicit logging. ##&& Uganda is a key wildlife trafficking hub. Most wildlife products from the region are destined for Asia (particularly China), the Middle East or re-exported out of Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda is a leading source country and trading hub for ivory and pangolin scale trade as well as products from poached lions, chimpanzees, various endangered reptiles and birds. Nevertheless, although it continues to a certain extent, bird exports from Uganda have declined significantly. Overfishing is another significant issue that poses a severe threat to biodiversity, particularly around Lake Victoria. In addition to being an important source country, Uganda is an important transit hub for illicit wildlife products from the DRC and South Sudan. Wildlife trafficking in Uganda remains well organized and powerful actors in the market both finance poaching and facilitate the cross-border smuggling of wildlife, while state-embedded criminals have participated in the criminal market. ##&& Uganda imports high volumes of gold before refining and re-exporting it. Uganda\u2019s gold export sector has grown extraordinarily in recent years. However, discrepancies between the production and declared import and export indicate illegality in Uganda\u2019s gold industry. Indeed, a significant amount of gold is smuggled into Uganda from Ituri in the DRC and South Sudan. Smugglers often collaborate with the Ugandan military and armed groups in both the DRC and South Sudan. Illicit sand mining is another pervasive criminal market. Illegal sand mining primarily occurs in rural districts of Masaka, Wakiso, Kalungu, Gomba and Mpigi around Lake Victoria, and is increasingly controlled by a combination of state-embedded actors, state-affiliated enterprises and powerful individuals with strong political connections. Sand mining cartels reportedly pose as sand mining investment agencies and trade the commodity primarily for use in mega-infrastructure projects in African and global construction markets.","text - drugs":"Uganda is a destination country for heroin as well as a transit hub for shipments destined for Europe and Asia. Heroin trafficked through Uganda is being transported across the Indian Ocean to Africa\u2019s east coast, entering Uganda via Kenya or Tanzania through concealment in the bodies of drug mules or among export goods. Heroin consumption primarily occurs among urban crowds, with evidence suggesting a relatively young consumer base. Uganda\u2019s domestic cocaine market is expanding, with the consumption of both cocaine and crack cocaine on the rise. Uganda also plays a significant role in the regional cocaine market, serving as a transit country for cocaine trafficking in the Great Lakes region. Cocaine trafficking is controlled by foreign criminal actors, and syndicates dominating the market in the country reportedly comprise a range of Ugandan, Italian, Serbian, Rwandan, Kenyan and West African criminals who operate in Kampala and Entebbe. ##&& Cannabis is the most widely available drug in Uganda, with cultivation occurring in multiple districts across the country. Uganda serves significant parts of the cannabis markets in Southern and Western African destinations. In January 2020, the Ugandan Ministry of Health approved the export of cannabis for medicinal purposes, as well as the domestic use of cannabis for medicine, rendering the country more significant in the global legal cannabis trade. Criminal markets for synthetic drugs appear to be limited in size. Drugs such as methamphetamine and ephedrine have been detected in Uganda, but they are reportedly too expensive for most Ugandan consumers. Most criminals involved in the market operate from Kenya, utilizing Ugandans as drug couriers.","text - criminal actors":"Many loose criminal networks engage in organized criminal activities in Uganda. High levels of corruption and an abundance of resources enable these networks to operate across various criminal markets, including non-renewable resources, fauna and flora markets, human smuggling, arms trafficking, drugs counterfeiting and other crimes. Uganda\u2019s flora and fauna trafficking markets, in particular, are very well organized, and both financed and facilitated by influential individuals with links to corrupt public and private sector officials. ##&& Another type of actor that plays an important role in Uganda\u2019s criminal markets comprises armed groups, militias and armed non-state actors, which resemble mafia-style groups. Prominent examples include the Allied Democratic Forces-National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (ADF-NALU), the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and the LRA. The ADF-NALU is based along the Ugandan\u2013Congolese border in North Kivu in the eastern DRC and engages in illicit gold mining, timber smuggling and precious metal mining between Uganda and the DRC. It is also known to abduct and traffic children. The ADF is an Islamist-rooted rebel militia engaged in wars in the DRC (particularly Ituri), financing itself in large part via different environmental criminal markets. Although the LRA was formed and previously based in northern Uganda, the group has largely been forced out of the country. However, it remains active and currently operates in South Sudan, the DRC and the Central African Republic. The LRA is engaged in poaching, arms trafficking as well as sex and combat trafficking of children. ##&& Apart from criminal networks and armed non-state actors, corruption makes Uganda an attractive hub for foreign criminal actors. Many organized criminal groups operating in or out of the country are multinational, and criminal actors from an array of South American, Asian, European and African countries have a presence in the country. High-level Ugandan officials have been implicated in organized crime in the environmental criminal markets, and police, customs and judiciary officials are known to accept bribes. Moreover, officials have been accused of colluding with fraudulent recruitment agencies that engage in human smuggling and trafficking, while military officials have been accused of cooperating with armed groups in the DRC and South Sudan.","text - leadership and governance":"The Ugandan government has publicly taken a strong stance against organized crime. Nevertheless, the implementation and enforcement of anti-organized crime measures are significantly lacking. Pockets of fragility continue to make Uganda vulnerable to organized crime, while systemic grand and political corruption enables state-embedded criminality and complicates responses. The Ugandan government has signed and ratified most international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. The country has established a series of extradition agreements with other members of the Commonwealth as well as bilateral labour agreements with labour-receiving countries in the Middle East and across the globe. Uganda has a powerful legislative framework against transnational organized crime, generated largely due to its long history of armed conflict. The framework includes laws on human trafficking, wildlife crime, laws regulating mineral trade and laws on forfeiture of criminal proceeds. However, despite the existence of anti-organized crime legislation, implementation remains a significant challenge, reportedly because of lack of funding.","text - criminal justice and security":"Uganda's judiciary lacks independence, the ability to consistently guarantee fair trials for criminal defendants and suffers from high levels of corruption and low levels of trust. Moreover, inadequate funding and staffing hamper the administration of justice. Prison conditions have often been found poor with overcrowding and lacking in sanitary conditions. Much like the courts, the police enjoy low levels of trust while suffering from institutional underfunding, low salaries and high rates of bribery and institutional corruption. Many Ugandan law enforcement officials are involved in criminal markets or amass illicit wealth through other means. However, internationally supported efforts have attempted to strengthen the ability of both the courts and law-enforcement agencies to respond to organized crime and corruption. Overall, the country has a moderate ability to ensure its territorial integrity, but smuggling activities continue to thrive because of the porousness of the borders that Uganda shares with its neighbours.","text - economic and financial environment":"Uganda\u2019s economy is reliant on agriculture and informal economic sectors, which are often low-productivity and subsistence-based. Structural transformation has driven growth and poverty reduction in the country, but the country continues to suffer from low levels of human capital. Private sector development faces several constraints, including corruption and weak public procurement rules. Illicit financial flows are a substantial issue in Uganda and the country is heavily exposed to tax evasion and money laundering. Uganda was on the Financial Action Task Force money-laundering blacklist between 2014 and 2017, but notable progress has been made since. However, despite improvements, Uganda\u2019s capacity to address money laundering remains limited, allowing the country to be used for actors who wish to evade sanctions or launder money. Sanctions for money laundering have not always been enforced, and the lack of investigative capacity has resulted in several stalled or dropped cases.","text - civil society and social protection":"While Uganda lacks legislation providing for the protection of witnesses, the judiciary has established guidelines for witness protection. Witness protection legislation has been subject to debate in the Ugandan parliament and a more comprehensive witness protection programme could be implemented in the near future. The government has introduced organized crime prevention policies as well as sector-specific initiatives that could potentially have a crime-preventive impact. In that respect, efforts towards prevention of human trafficking have been noteworthy. The country enacted a trafficking in persons prevention act in 2009 and has been engaging in public sensitisation, capacity building and training of relevant officials and collaboration with partner counterparts, mainly in destination countries. However, whether these initiatives will be effective remains in question. ##&& Non-state actors such as NGOs and churches play a significant role in victim support in Uganda and do important work in areas such as combatting human trafficking and rehabilitating drug users. However, the space for civil society has been shrinking over the years and authorities have sometimes targeted civil-society organizations that engage in politically sensitive issues, such as accountability and transparency in governance. Moreover, intimidation and violence against journalists, especially by state security forces, occurs often, as do threats of prosecution, resulting in an extremely repressive media environment.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Kampala","GDP (current $US million)":"35165.16","Income group":"Low income","Population":"44269594","Land Area (sq. km)":"241550","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"92.9","Freedom in the World Index":"34","Human Development Index":"0.54","Global Peace Index":"2.20","Democracy Index":"4.94","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"27","GDP per capita (current US$)":"794","1":"6.14","1.1":"5.65","1.2":"6.63","2":"3.96"},{"Corresp":"192","ISO-3":"ZMB","Country":"Zambia","ISO-2":"ZM","Continent":"Africa","Region":"Southern Africa","Flag file":"zm.png","1.

Human trafficking victims and offenders from Southern Asia and Eastern Asia have also been identified in Zambia. Chinese groups are known to traffic girls and women from China into Zambia, where they are exploited in massage parlours and brothels, while Chinese men are trafficked for forced labour in Chinese-owned companies operating in Zambia. Other human trafficking victims come from countries such as Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Syria. However, many foreign trafficking victims have transited through Zambia to destinations such as South Africa and Namibia as well as Zimbabwe and Mozambique. ##&& With regard to human smuggling, Zambia is both a transit and destination country.

Despite attempts to ban the transport of endangered wood products, recent years have seen Zambia\u2019s forest cover significantly reduced due to criminal activity. Criminal economies related to the exploitation of the country\u2019s hardwood exist at each stage of the value chain, from extraction to milling, transport, sale and the laundering of criminal proceeds. Criminals involved in timber trafficking networks are increasingly of Asian origin, and Chinese business operatives play an important and active role in the market. However, several Zambian politicians and senior officials are also involved, enabling criminal networks to bypass existing national bans on harvest and export and use state-owned companies such as Zambia Forestry and Forest Industries Corporation Limited. Evidence indicates that associates of high-ranking officials are involved in this plunder. ##&& Criminal fauna markets and wildlife trafficking are pervasive in Zambia too. Bushmeat trafficking, in particular, poses a significant threat to Zambian wildlife, as an informal and unregulated illicit bushmeat industry has emerged. Poachers also kill lions, leopards and cheetahs to sell their skins in Zambian markets and poach elephants to sell the ivory. As such, Zambia\u2019s capital Lusaka is a known wildlife trafficking hub. Although pangolins are protected by Zambian law, pangolin poaching has also increased in Zambia in recent years. Additionally, a shared high-porosity border with ivory source countries such as Angola, DRC, Mozambique and Tanzania exacerbates the country\u2019s vulnerability to wildlife trafficking. As such, Zambia is a transit country for the global illicit ivory trade. ##&& Illicit copper mining is common in Zambia.

Zambia\u2019s cocaine market has grown in the past 10 years, with rising rates of consumption and an expansion in the overland transport of cocaine from Latin America via West African and East African continental entry points. As with heroin, cocaine is increasingly available on the streets of major urban centres in Zambia. Cannabis cultivation in Zambia is largely driven by both national and regional cannabis consumption. ##&& Cannabis cultivation is perceived among Southern African countries as a sustainable source of income, as well as a reliable source of income for the rural poor. Many rural Zambian women are known to cultivate and provide cannabis to sellers in urban markets. Moreover, cannabis cultivation for medical purposes is legal in the country with a permit issued by the Ministry of Health. Cannabis is also reportedly imported into Zambia from Malawi and Zimbabwe. Production, trafficking or consumption of synthetic drugs are not known to happen on a large scale in Zambia. However, evidence suggests that some quantity of methamphetamine and methaqualone is imported into or produced in Zambia. A street drug referred to as Mandrax, which contains methaqualone as the main ingredient, is reportedly becoming popular throughout the country. Mandrax is also imported to Zambia from India and is known to be trafficked overland from Tanzania and Mozambique to various African markets. ","text - criminal actors":"Foreign actors play a significant role in organized criminal activity in Zambia. Human trafficking cases in recent years have involved criminals and victims from a range of countries across the African continent as well as from Southern Asia, South-eastern Asia and, in particular, China. South African criminal groups are also known to traffic victims through Zambia en route to South Africa. In addition to human trafficking, foreign actors are known to be responsible for a large part of the trafficking of ivory, and smuggling of contraband and fuel as well as drugs. Additionally, corruption among law enforcement officials runs rampant in Zambia. Criminal networks in Zambia also engage in strategic influence over state-embedded actors and businesspeople, resulting in a triangular crime framework with a highly complex and variable relationship in which the distances between various points on the triangle are constantly evolving. Thus, each sector at the triangle\u2019s vortex is a complex combination of subsectors, with the state being perhaps the most amorphous actor. ##&& Criminal networks are also heavily engaged in organized criminal activity in Zambia and remain active in a wide variety of criminal markets, including wildlife trafficking, flora crimes, human trafficking, non-renewable resource crimes, human smuggling and cybercrime. As mentioned, the latter tend to include state-embedded actors and legal businesses who cooperate and coordinate criminal activities. Moreover, many criminal groups operating in Zambia are linked to counterparts in other Southern African countries. Conversely, no evidence suggests a significant presence of mafia-style groups in Zambia.","text - leadership and governance":"The Zambian government lacks leadership in its anti-organized crime approach. Although the country is relatively peaceful and the government enjoys comparatively high levels of confidence among the population, the country suffers a governance deficit. Moreover, the Zambian government remains dependent upon external support for both economic sustenance and in its fight against organized crime. By global standards, Zambia suffers relatively high levels of corruption and both grand corruption and corruption in law enforcement continue to reduce the country\u2019s resilience to organized crime. Zambia\u2019s institutional and legal oversight mechanisms are not currently capable of effectively combating and preventing corruption, with anti-corruption institutions such as the Anti-Corruption Commission, the Auditor-General and the Ombudsman lacking resources and efficiency. ##&& Zambia has ratified most major international treaties pertaining to organized crime. The country engages in international cooperation and has partnered with both international and regional organizations that combat transnational crime. Zambia has also engaged in bilateral judicial and law enforcement cooperation with many of its neighbours with a view to combating human trafficking. Furthermore, Zambia cooperates with a number of international donors on areas relevant to combating organized crime and corruption. The country houses multiple sites for the Monitoring of the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE). Zambia\u2019s anti-organized crime legislative framework is relatively advanced compared to those of many other countries in the region. The legal framework addresses both organized crime in a general sense and specific markets such as human smuggling, human trafficking, arms trafficking, drug trafficking and the different environmental markets.","text - criminal justice and security":"Zambia\u2019s judiciary is often subject to political pressure that limits its independence and due process for defendants is unequally guaranteed in practice. Moreover, in many parts of Zambia, statutory legal institutions have limited reach, making many citizens reliant on customary law institutions. Although the Zambian constitution allows the establishment of specialized courts, the country currently lacks a specialized judicial unit dedicated to the fight against organized crime. Instead, the Zambian judiciary remains reliant on international resources and support to prosecute cases of organized crime. Zambian law enforcement capacity in the fight against organized crime is reportedly expanding. Nevertheless, poor pay and funding gaps among law enforcement contribute to corruption, and law enforcement officials have been known to participate in or enable organized crime in return for payment. ##&& Territorial integrity is weak, as the country shares long and difficult-to-monitor borders. Human and material resources necessary for ensuring efficient border control are also lacking, which creates additional vulnerabilities and opens up the country to illicit flows.","text - economic and financial environment":"Approximately half of Zambia\u2019s population is engaged in some form of subsistence farming, but there are also some manufacturing and service industries. Overall, Zambia has made considerable development progress over the years, but, in recent years, falling growth rates and fluctuating copper prices have put a brake on the country\u2019s continued economic expansion. Rapid demographic expansion and vulnerability to both price and environmental shocks continue to be sources of economic vulnerability. Zambia continues to have limited capacity to monitor illicit financial flows and for combating issues such as corporate tax evasion and money laundering. However, in 2019, Zambia was found to be compliant with 11 of the 40 Financial Action Task Force recommendations, and non-compliant in just one.","text - civil society and social protection":"Zambia has few mechanisms to support victims and victim protection efforts in the country are for the most part not up to international standards. Zambia lacks a witness protection programme, providing few incentives for witnesses to participate in trials or investigations. At the same time, however, the Zambian government has demonstrated increased efforts to combat human trafficking and law enforcement has become more active in applying preventive approaches to crime \u2013 often with the help of civil-society actors. However, these efforts may have been less impactful in urban spaces and have not necessarily targeted all at-risk groups equally. Civil society and NGOs in Zambia are active in areas such as preventing wildlife crime and rehabilitating drug users, however, in spite of their critical contributions, freedom of assembly and the right of NGOs to operate independently has come under pressure in recent years. The Zambian media operates with severe restrictions. Acts of intimidation, violence as well as threats of prosecution and closure have been commonplace in recent years.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Lusaka","GDP (current $US million)":"23309.77","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"17861030","Land Area (sq. km)":"752610","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"84.9","Freedom in the World Index":"52","Human Development Index":"0.58","Global Peace Index":"1.79","Democracy Index":"4.86","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"33","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1305","1":"4.93","1.1":"4.60","1.2":"5.25","2":"4.33"},{"Corresp":"193","ISO-3":"ZWE","Country":"Zimbabwe","ISO-2":"ZW","Continent":"Africa","Region":"Southern Africa","Flag file":"zw.png","1.

Sex trafficking is particularly common in border towns, while forced labour appears to be significant in agriculture, construction, hospitality and domestic servitude. The traditional practice of ngozi, where the spirits of dead relatives are appeased through giving a member of the family to another kin, opens up additional vulnerabilities to trafficking. Moreover, the deteriorating socio-economic conditions continue to contribute to human trafficking. ##&& Over the course of the past four decades, because of the growing insecurity in the country, Zimbabwe\u2019s role has shifted away from being a destination market to a country of origin as well as a transit hub for human smuggling. Irregular migration is thus widespread, with many irregular migrants being skilled Zimbabwean workers or people originating in the Horn of Africa. Although borders are porous, the use of smugglers' services is common. In fact, complicit cross-border transporters and corrupt border management officials, especially on the borders with South Africa and Botswana, facilitate smuggling. ","text - trade":"While there is no evidence for the presence of a significant illicit arms market in Zimbabwe, small arms and light weapons (SALW) are trafficked into the country. Accounts point to remnants of arm stockpiles used by the apartheid regime in South Africa being smuggled within the Southern Africa region, Zimbabwe included. Additionally, Chinese small arms have been instrumental in the suppression of the democratic progress in Zimbabwe. Most recently, reports have alleged that modified tanker trucks have been used for the smuggling of drugs, wildlife and arms into the country. Although no armed violence has broken out in Zimbabwe in the post-independence era, due to the easy availability of SALW the possibility of armed violence has increased.","text - environment":"Illegal logging has increasingly taken place in the country, resulting in significant deforestation and threatening the existence of endangered indigenous forests. Reportedly, illegal logging syndicates work with corrupt officials to exploit legislative loopholes that allow them to pass illicit wood as legitimate and export it in the region. While the ban on the exportation of hardwood timber and the landlocked position of Zimbabwe minimizes commercial smuggling, it does not eliminate domestic trade. Illegal logging is a main source of income for many in impoverished communities, with illegal settlements and wood traders allegedly working just outside of protected parks. Accounts assert that this happens with the implicit consent of state officials. ##&& There are reports of significant levels of poaching in Zimbabwe, in particular for ivory and rhino horns, but also for a range of other species, including pangolins. While officials insist that poaching has dropped in recent years, the success of state measures is questionable as wildlife trafficking appears to involve state actors. Additionally, Zimbabwe seems to be the epicentre for pangolin poaching despite having one of the strictest laws against pangolin poaching in Africa. Importantly, poaching of lions for their parts also occurs in Zimbabwe, with lion parts destined for both local and foreign markets, being trafficked to Asia, often sold there as tiger parts. Cross-border smuggling routes (especially of ivory) have become quite common, as poachers from Zambia cross into Zimbabwe, and then bring the ivory back to Zambia where it is sold. Similarly, lion bones are taken to South Africa to be sold to Chinese nationals. Hence, transnational organized criminal groups from China and Vietnam are also involved in the fauna market. Notably, in 2017 Zimbabwe was considered part of the most common ivory trafficking route, running from Harare to Hong Kong through Dubai. ##&& Due to high unemployment, more than 400 000 Zimbabweans by some estimates have turned to illegal mining. Since 2017, illegal gold mining in particular has quickly spread through the Eastern Highlands and other parts of the country. While basic prospecting and mining is conducted by \u2018syndicates\u2019 of desperate, unregistered miners, knowledge of and access to markets is monopolized by elite bureaucrats who also earn the lion's share of the proceeds. Zimbabwe\u2019s resource looting is one of the best encapsulations of a predatory elite \u2013 political and military, enriching themselves to the detriment of the country\u2019s benefit. Reportedly, organized crime groups use the leverage of state power to export diamonds. In this way, the trade is deemed legal by virtue of the Kimberly Process, but the diamond industry is in fact captured by criminal actors. ","text - drugs":"Heroin is reportedly widely used In Zimbabwe, both as powder and in the nyaope form that is smoked. Users include wealthy Zimbabweans who use powder as well as poorer consumers in rural areas who consume nyaope and heavily diluted powder. As a result, Zimbabwe is not a very lucrative market for heroin. Conversely, Zimbabwe is emerging as a significant inland transit country for heroin, trafficked from Tanzania and Mozambique to West and Southern Africa markets. Allegedly, the country is also a transhipment point for heroin travelling to European markets. The means of heroin entering Zimbabwe range from the drug being smuggled by returning Zimbabwean migrant workers to criminal networks using cargo shipments and drug mules to import the drug. Importantly, information suggests that public figures, as well as political and military officials are all heavily engaged at different stages of the heroin supply chain. In line with the country's deteriorating security situation, it appears that Zimbabwe comes out as a waypoint for cocaine. Conversely, the country does not have a large domestic market for pure cocaine because of the population's low purchasing power. Instead, similar to heroin, cocaine is often diluted with other substances. ##&& Cannabis is widely produced and consumed in Zimbabwe, and is often exported abroad. Nevertheless, the country is also a destination point for cannabis coming from Malawi and Mozambique as well as an established transhipment point. Reportedly, organized crime groups control the cannabis trade, but a new law was introduced in 2018, which allowed farmers to grow cannabis for medical and research purposes. The synthetic drugs market in Zimbabwe is large and growing, due to the lower prices of synthetic drugs. Notably, Zimbabwe is also a transit point for methamphetamines en route to South Africa. ","text - criminal actors":"There is a strong indication since the late 1980s of political and other governmental office holders abusing their respective positions and taking part in activities that are either criminal or illicit. Some of the longest-serving political figures have allegedly long been part of criminal networks. It is thus arguable that the state controls various crime markets in Zimbabwe, in particular trafficking of diamonds and fuel as well as cigarette smuggling and wildlife trafficking. Related to state-embedded actors, criminal networks are also prominent in Zimbabwe. Networks of crime entrepreneurs engage in organized criminal activity often with the help of state-embedded actors, who sanction the use of violence for their economic self-gain. In terms of criminal markets dominated by criminal networks, drug trafficking has increased as such groups groom mules to smuggle hard drugs into the country. Reportedly, a number of crime syndicates of drug lords dominate the markets for illicit drugs in larger cities in the country, such as Bulawayo and Harare as well as in strategic border towns, such as Beitbridge and Mutare. Again, these syndicates engage the services of high-level officials, but cooperation between those two types of criminal actors is evident across other criminal activities, such as wildlife trade. ##&& The vast majority of foreign actors in Zimbabwe operate in the extractive industries, but there are such who engage in other criminal markets \u2013 human trafficking and the drug trade, for example. South African nationals account for the majority of foreign criminal actors in the country, but the Chinese diaspora is also active, particularly in diamond mining as well as trafficking of human beings. Furthermore, China's ties with the Zimbabwean army are reportedly deep and the former has become Zimbabwe's top export market. Not least of all, China continues to be a large destination market for Illegal wildlife products. Although there are groups of armed men with political affiliations operating in Zimbabwe, there is no evidence of their links to illicit activity or protection networks. There are, however, smaller, violent gangs who mainly engage in illicit mining activities.","text - leadership and governance":"As noted above, there is a high degree of criminalization of the Zimbabwean state and, stemming from that, a high level of state control of criminal markets in the country, coupled with a rather poor anti-organized crime platform. With that said, however, the current president has been vocal in aiming to secure greater legitimacy at home and abroad by taking a hard line on corruption and government involvement in criminal activities. There remains doubt as to whether his administration will tackle these issues, as indicated by the 2018 scandal involving the vice-president's wife. Corruption within the Zimbabwean state has arguably had a role in the increase of organized crime in the country and reportedly, as of present, corruption levels are high at the expense of government transparency. Certain legislative reforms were introduced in 2019, but although oversight mechanisms are in place, they are often described as compromised. ##&& Zimbabwe is party to a number of conventions pertaining to organized crime, but the legislative framework on organized crime in Zimbabwe is weakly developed and does not meet international standards. While human trafficking has been addressed in a National Plan of Action, the application of flora and fauna protection legislation has been disastrously uneven. Although laws against poachers appear strict, Zimbabwe is now advocating to lift the worldwide ban on ivory trade in an attempt to sell its stockpiles.","text - criminal justice and security":"In the contested political environment in Zimbabwe, the criminal justice system has been a forum for conflict between human rights and the exercise of governmental authority. Trust in the judiciary is low, with strong evidence suggesting that political pressures and corruption are rife. Despite overwhelming evidence of organized criminal activity, convictions are rarely secured. At the same time, dissenting voices are silenced via \u2018legal\u2019 means, including charges of attempting to overthrow a constitutional government and inciting public violence. People are then held in jails for weeks, if not months, awaiting trial. ##&& On the other hand, law enforcement officers are underfunded and poorly trained, which establishes the prerequisite for corruption in the sector. There are no police units specialized in countering organized crime. In addition, reformative reorientation to prioritize human security rather than the security of the regime is long overdue, but the politicized recruitment, training and promotion practices have upheld the status quo. Alongside this, the absence of mechanisms for retrospectively holding police officers to account for alleged abuse has led police to operate with a heavy hand when it comes to protecting the regime. ##&& Despite issues of corruption among border control personnel, Zimbabwe has control over its territory. There is physical infrastructure in place, including game and high-security fencing, but more importantly, there is enhanced multi-lateral collaboration of border management and law enforcement agencies and structures with foreign counterparts. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has escalated the focus on better border control and a broad range of measures appear to have been taken by neighbouring countries in order to secure borders.","text - economic and financial environment":"Zimbabwe boasts a relatively sound anti-money laundering\/combating the financing of terrorism regime with a financial intelligence unit as well as a unit dedicated to the recovery of criminal proceeds being functional. There is, however, limited information on the practical implementation of coordination and cooperation measures against money laundering. A further concern stems from the limitations on the autonomy and professional independence of the structures assigned the responsibility of guarding transparency and enforcing accountability. The executive's control over resources and selection of leadership compromises their effectiveness and credibility. Thus, the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing is among the highest in the world. The country\u2019s business climate is also criticized and necessitates the implementation of significant structural and fiscal reforms. In addition, patronage and corruption have led to a chaotic state of management of public finances, which has further eroded trust in the state and in key regulatory institutions.","text - civil society and social protection":"Zimbabwe offers little in terms of treatment and victim support, which is instead left to civil society and foreign governments. There is also no evidence of functioning and comprehensive witness protection programmes either. Conversely, the government has maintained efforts to prevent trafficking and has come up with a national action plan against human trafficking. The latter, however, was not yet launched at the time of writing. While awareness raising has been key to prevention efforts so far, dedicated governmental funds are scarce. In addition, there is no single programme in Zimbabwe to provide support to substance abusers. Instead, scattered organizations provide assistance to communities with health education, support for quitting and treatment. ##&& Zimbabwe has a vibrant civil-society organization (CSO) sector, which is increasingly under pressure from authorities. As socio-economic conditions in the country deteriorate, state institutions have actively sought to restrict the space in which civil society operates. Similarly, while considered independent, media are also under pressure from the state. In spite of that, along with an improved access to information, the practice of self-censorship has become less prevalent, but journalists are still subject to harassment and intimidation. Not least of all, in 2020 security agencies escalated the pressure on CSOs and investigative journalists, evident in the regular arrests and abductions.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Harare","GDP (current $US million)":"21440.76","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"14645468","Land Area (sq. km)":"390760","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"99.1","Freedom in the World Index":"28","Human Development Index":"0.57","Global Peace Index":"2.49","Democracy Index":"3.16","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"24","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1464","1":"5.67","1.1":"5.20","1.2":"6.13","2":"3.17"}],"1":"5.17","1.1":"4.94","1.1.1":"5.93","1.1.2":"4.85","1.1.3":"5.56","1.1.4":"4.73","1.1.5":"5.39","1.1.6":"5.44","1.1.7":"3.81","1.1.8":"4.10","1.1.9":"5.26","1.1.10":"4.34","1.2":"5.40","1.2.1":"3.11","1.2.2":"5.96","1.2.3":"6.89","1.2.4":"5.63","2":"3.80","2.1":"3.75","2.2":"3.30","2.3":"4.79","2.4":"4.61","2.5":"3.67","2.6":"3.81","2.7":"4.24","2.8":"3.89","2.9":"3.69","2.10":"2.81","2.11":"3.08","2.12":"3.95"},"americas":{"Continent":"Americas","Population":1008487669,"Land Area (sq. km)":40125947,"GDP (current $US million)":28832358.74,"children":[{"Corresp":"6","ISO-3":"ATG","Country":"Antigua and Barbuda","ISO-2":"AG","Continent":"Americas","Region":"Caribbean","Flag file":"ag.png","1.

Additionally, anecdotal evidence suggests that caregivers and parents are responsible for forcing children into sexual exploitation. Antigua is a child-sex-tourism destination for locals and tourists. There are also allegations against off-duty police officers, claiming the latter are complicit in human trafficking, helping criminal groups by impeding investigations or persuading victims not to report crimes. ##&& There is little evidence of human smuggling in Antigua and Barbuda. When it does occur, it is enabled through document forgery for migration purposes, which is reported to have taken place with Antiguan and Barbudan passports.","text - trade":"Gun crime among the youth on the island is increasing and reports suggest that security services either provide the weapons themselves or facilitate gun crime by allowing organized groups to traffic weapons into the country. Arms trafficking seems to be the reason for the high rates of serious crime within the Caribbean region.","text - environment":"While no evidence supports the existence of a flora crimes market in Antigua and Barbuda, there is a small market for illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and trafficking of conch. Although fauna crimes may be committed by individuals, export to destination markets requires illegal purchasers, which effectively creates criminal networks. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest a non-renewable-resources crime market exists.","text - drugs":"Heroin is neither produced nor commonly shipped on the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) route, which would imply there is no significant heroin market in Antigua and Barbuda. The country, however, is situated in the middle of major drug trafficking routes that connect major narcotics source countries in South America with major destination markets in the North (e.g. the United Kingdom and the US). This, alongside lack of monitoring and policing of territorial waters, makes Antigua and Barbuda a key transit point for cocaine. Cocaine is trafficked via marine routes in small speedboats, yachts, fishing vessels and large freighters. Traffickers usually deliver and offload their drug shipments either on beaches or offshore, where the drug loads are moved to smaller boats, from whereon drug shipments make their way to destination markets. Drug traffickers also transport cocaine and cannabis to Antigua and Barbuda on commercial airlines. There have been allegations of state actors facilitating the drug trade to some extent. ##&& Antigua and Barbuda cultivates small quantities of cannabis in the hilly and sparsely populated areas of the countryside, mainly for local consumption. Production alone, however, is unable to sustain the demand, which is why cannabis is trafficked from Jamaica, St Vincent and Colombia. Due to territorial vulnerabilities, cannabis is smuggled to Antigua and Barbuda by sea and air routes. There have been reports of synthetic drug seizures, but these have been isolated incidents, with smuggling attempts carried out by individuals. It is therefore difficult to verify a possible link between synthetic drugs and organized crime.","text - criminal actors":"It is likely that foreign actors are engaging in the drug trade in Antigua and Barbuda, as the island country is too small to organize trafficking flows on its own. Instead, Guatemalans, Jamaicans and Guyanese are supposedly involved in cocaine and cannabis trafficking operations, as well as human trafficking. Antigua and Barbuda has had a long history of corruption since it gained independence from the United Kingdom. Currently, however, reports suggest only low-level state actors facilitate criminal markets, including arms, drug and human trafficking. ##&& Criminal networks appear to be concentrated in poorer areas and mostly engage in theft, car break-ins and home invasions. Nevertheless, reports indicate that loose networks are becoming more involved in the trafficking of women from abroad and forcing them into sexual exploitation. Allegedly, local criminal networks also cooperate with transnational organizations in trafficking drugs. Officials maintain that gangs that operate in the country typically involve young men, and are not highly organized. Arguably, however, these gangs could be considered mafia-style groups.","text - leadership and governance":"The current government appears to take a strong stance on organized crime, with the administration raising the bar in terms of addressing high-level corruption and organized crime more generally. Notably, however, Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s prime minister, Gaston Browne, has criticized the blacklisting of Caribbean countries as non-cooperative tax jurisdictions a number of times. In addition, public sentiment towards the government is positive and the democratic process is free of criminal influence. While Antigua and Barbuda has had a long history of corruption, the current government has increased transparency and established oversight mechanisms. Public access to information is also well established in practice and although the anti-corruption legal framework is fairly resilient, it has its shortcomings. Additionally, the government lacks resources to undertake investigations into corruption, and anonymity and security for whistle-blowers is not guaranteed. ##&& Antigua and Barbuda is party to all relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. The country is also well represented in the CARICOM and cooperates on matters of security with other members. In recognizing the threat of organized crime, the CARICOM\u2019s Implementation Agency for Crime and Security has developed the Caribbean Counter Illicit Trafficking Strategy in collaboration with regional and international stakeholders. In line with Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s international commitments, the legal framework is robust enough to respond to the organized crime threats the country is facing. More specifically, attention has been dedicated to drug trafficking and use, with a new five-year plan drafted, seeking to coordinate the island country\u2019s anti-drug initiative. Importantly, cannabis legislation was made more lenient, legalizing certain aspects of cannabis use in the country.","text - criminal justice and security":"Despite the independence of the judiciary, inadequacies in the judicial process have created distrust in the judicial system and authorities more generally. The judiciary is arguably inefficient as criminal procedures often take long to progress, creating a backlog of cases. There is only one prison in Antigua and Barbuda, and poor living conditions render the institution non-compliant to international standards. In addition, overpopulation is reportedly a serious concern, making formal prison control difficult and creating opportunity for corruption among prison guards, which is arguably high. The Royal Antigua and Barbuda Police Force is the principal agency that bears responsibility for maintaining law and order in the country. Corruption, particularly the practice of accepting bribes, is present within police ranks, but allegations of misconduct are investigated and measures against transgressors are taken. Although the country is a transit point for drug trafficking, and border control is weak, no law enforcement unit specifically tasked with countering organized crime exists. Instead, sniffer-dog units are deployed and searches are conducted on all inbound flights from Jamaica. Additional measures have recently been taken to improve security through better control of sea borders.","text - economic and financial environment":"Antigua and Barbuda is a well-known tax sheltering country, which is why there is a high level of political commitment to the identification and mitigation of money laundering and terrorist financing risks. To that end, the Office of National Drug and Money Laundering Control Policy (ONDCP) cooperates with financial institutions in Antigua and Barbuda, supervising and encouraging the fulfilment of mechanisms aimed at identifying and preventing money laundering. The ONDCP also supervises financial institutions and monitors whether they are being employed as depositories for legitimate or criminal funds that may be used to finance terrorism. Overall, great efforts have been made to enact new legislation to fight the laundering of criminal proceeds while keeping up with international standards. The government has mechanisms to ensure that legitimate businesses are able to operate free from criminal activities.

Positive steps have been taken to increase victim support, including training for law enforcement on anti-human trafficking, as well as increased investigations into human trafficking by the Antigua and Barbuda Trafficking in Persons Prevention Committee, which is the agency responsible for coordinating national anti-human-trafficking efforts. The committee, which has also produced a national education campaign that provides information on red flags and trends in organized crime and human trafficking, includes regional partnerships with Belize, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and the Bahamas to formalize and strengthen regional cooperation mechanisms. In regard to drug trafficking, the Substance Abuse and Prevention Division of the Ministry of Health, Social Transformation and Consumer Affairs plays a vital role in raising public awareness of the risks of drug abuse. There is an anti-drug plan in place, which focuses on awareness and education programmes, counselling and treatment initiatives, and rehabilitation and reintegration. There are active NGOs and some that engage with victims of trafficking, offering them shelter. Overall, however, NGOs are inadequately funded and often under political influence.

Victims are mostly female, and from disadvantaged parts of the country. Forced labour is also common in Argentina and affects women, men and children in sizeable numbers. Argentinian groups and foreign actors, mostly from Latin America but also from China, reportedly traffic victims primarily from Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia and the Dominican Republic. ##&& Although there is a human smuggling market in Argentina, it is comparably small in size. Notably, the Chinese mafia is allegedly involved in the smuggling of irregular migrants into Argentina.","text - trade":"Argentina\u2019s small domestic arms market has recently grown because of a ban on arms imports in Paraguay. Arguably, the country's strategic location in combination with direct sea links to Europe, and its porous borders might explain why organized crime groups are testing Argentina as a possible link in the trafficking of arms. Allegedly, parts shipped from Europe and the United States are assembled in Argentina and the weapons are then smuggled through Paraguay and sold to Brazilian criminal organizations, including the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital \u2014 PCC) and the Red Command (Comando Vermelho). It appears, therefore, that weapons transiting Argentina or originating in the country are sold mostly in Latin America.","text - environment":"While there is no evidence to suggest organized criminal groups engage in illegal logging in Argentina, hundreds of thousands of hectares of wetlands in the country\u2019s Parana Delta have been deliberately, and in many cases illegally, set on fire as a means of preparing the land for agricultural practices. Furthermore, although reliable data on illicit fauna crimes is lacking, preliminary studies suggest that Argentina is a source and transit country for exotic species, originating predominantly in Bolivia, Paraguay and Chile, and trafficked to the European Union \u2013 mostly Spain, Italy and Malta \u2013 or the Middle East. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing also seems to be an issue, as a lack of regulations and control in the South Atlantic facilitates poaching along the boundary of Argentina\u2019s exclusive economic zone, mostly by foreign fleets. Although gasoline theft from a state-owned company has been recorded, and allegations have been made against various oil companies of illegally handling fracking waste, non-renewable resource crimes are generally limited across the country.","text - drugs":"Cannabis is the most prevalent drug in Argentina and its use is reportedly on the rise. The country appears to be mostly a destination for cannabis, with most of the product trafficked from Paraguay. Cannabis is also trafficked through Argentina destined for Chile. Cannabis arrives by truck, with the porous border and the substantial network of roads that converge in large cities, being used to evade authorities. Nevertheless, domestic cultivation of cannabis increased in 2020, primarily in the coastal areas of the country. Corruption, especially within the police force, appears to be associated with the cannabis market. Drug-related violence in the country is suspected to be primarily related to the cannabis and cocaine trades. ##&& Cocaine is the second most consumed drug in the country, with consumption reportedly tripling since 2010. Argentina is reported to have one of the highest cocaine consumption rate in the Western Hemisphere. Official information suggests that Argentina is both a destination and transit point, with the Argentine\u2013Bolivian border serving as the primary route for cocaine trafficked through the country\u2019s north-west regions. Drugs are predominantly transported by plane, using \u2018bombardment\u2019 drops, or by land. Local cocaine production is minimal. Besides Argentinian nationals, foreign actors from Europe and Colombia are involved in cocaine trafficking to and through Argentina. Cocaine is often trafficked through the ports of Rosario and Buenos Aires either directly to Europe, or to Europe via Africa. ##&& Synthetic drugs, especially Ecstasy, are also quite popular in Argentina, with consumption rising by more than 200% since 2010. Nevertheless, synthetic drugs are considerably less prevalent than cannabis and cocaine. Seizure data suggests that methamphetamine is often imported from Mexico, whereas Ecstasy comes predominantly from the United States. There are indications of domestic Ecstasy production, but the generated quantities would not be enough to satisfy demand in Argentina. Even though drugs generally are a concerning issue in Argentina, the country's heroin consumption, and by extension, heroin trafficking, is low.","text - criminal actors":"Although loose criminal networks operate in cities such as Rosario and Buenos Aires, especially in the retail sale of drugs, they are not large entities. Nevertheless, criminal networks appear to be the most prominent criminal actor types in Argentina. Transnational criminal groups based in other South American countries operate in Argentina as well. Notably, Mexican and Colombian cartels are linked to growing violence in Argentina's drug trade, while Chinese mafia groups are active in human smuggling, and Brazilian groups in arms trafficking. Evidence suggests that domestic groups, more specifically the Loza and Castedo clans, have ties with transnational actors, although their cooperation is still relatively small scale. Such criminal links are evident in the northern regions of the country, as well as in the cities of Rosario and Buenos Aires. ##&& Although state-embedded actors are not generally directly involved in criminal organizations, corruption in Argentina is considered to be pervasive, in particular within local police forces. Money laundering is also believed to involve high-level politicians, and many of the family clans that are increasing in strength in the country benefit from connections to the political elite. While Argentina is not usually associated with the traditional organized criminal groups operating in other countries in Latin America, there has been a growth in recent years of family clans akin to mafia-style groups operating in the organized criminal space in Argentina, mostly within the drug and arms trafficking markets. Such groups are locally based and have strong control over specific neighbourhoods. They are part of the communities, gaining the respect of their members by occasionally investing in their communities in ways the state is unable or unwilling to. Clans are usually led by older members of the family, and operate across the country, although many are concentrated in Rosario, Cordoba, Buenos Aires and smaller cities in Argentina\u2019s northern regions. There are several prominent clans in Argentina, namely the Los Monos, Cantero, Bassi, Funes, Camino, Torres, Castedo and Loza. Although mafia-style groups have no control over the prison system, some groups have successfully infiltrated various security and political institutions, thwarting justice for long periods of time.","text - leadership and governance":"The former Argentinian government took a strong stance on organized crime, but the current administration has lost momentum and has been criticized for it. Argentina is among the more stable developing countries in the world, but trust in the authorities is low. Additionally, with the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities, including law enforcement, have shifted their focus to humanitarian assistance, which has prevented them from efficiently enforcing regulations and controlling strategic hubs. High-level political figures are allegedly involved in corruption and money laundering. Anti-corruption bodies exist, but have been questioned because of political influence over their work. Nevertheless, the democratic process is considered independent from political influence. ##&& Argentina is party to most international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. The country cooperates well with neighbouring countries as well as with European states, Spain in particular, in the area of countering organized crime. Although extradition treaties with partners are in force, there have not been any cases of extradition from Argentina related to organized crime in the five years leading up to December 2020. In line with the country's international commitments to tackling organized crime, Argentina's legislative framework is able to adequately respond to current threats, although implementation of the legal framework is lacking.","text - criminal justice and security":"A unit dedicated to countering organized crime exists within Argentina's judicial system, but it is difficult to assess its capacity to carry out its assignments, as political interference in judicial proceedings is common. Furthermore, there have been dozens of recent cases of corruption involving members of the judiciary. Argentina\u2019s prisons are overcrowded, and reports indicate inhumane living conditions, food deficiencies, poor building management and substandard hygiene control within facilities. Reportedly, certain family clan leaders have managed to run their organizations from within the prison system, which further challenges the penal system. Overall, the entire judiciary is considered inefficient and corrupt. ##&& The situation is similar in the security sector, where corruption is rampant and public trust in law enforcement agencies low. The Federal Police and its special units are the main actors tasked with tackling organized crime. Their efforts are aided by the Federal Intelligence Agency. Despite the existence of these enforcement agencies in Argentina, authorities struggle to effectively control the borders, especially in the north-west, which are most vulnerable to trafficking. Information suggests that the Argentine\u2013Bolivian border is the main route for cocaine, while cannabis is trafficked primarily through the Argentine-Paraguayan border. The ports of Buenos Aires and Rosario are also vulnerable and are used to ship illicit substances to Europe.","text - economic and financial environment":"Argentina has anti-money-laundering legislation, but a general anti-money-laundering\/combating the financing of terrorism strategy is lacking, making the risk of money laundering extremely high. In broad terms, legitimate business operates free from criminal activity in the country. Land and property rights are upheld and there are no specific sectors of the economy controlled by organized crime, although instances of extortion rackets have been recorded. Doing business, however, is somewhat difficult because aspects of the state's economic regulatory capacity are burdensome.","text - civil society and social protection":"A legislative mechanism guides the prevention and prosecuting of human trafficking, as well as victim assistance in Argentina. In line with this, the Office for the Rescue and Accompaniment of Persons Damaged by the Crime of Human Trafficking was established, responsible for the psychological, social, medical and legal assistance of victims. Overall, the government has a fairly robust framework in place to provide support to victims of trafficking. In addition, a national witness protection agency within the ranks of the Ministry of Justice provides protection to witnesses and defendants in criminal cases. The government has reportedly implemented more than half of the provisions in its 2018\u20132020 national anti-human trafficking action plan. Notably, no specific budget was allocated for the plan, which raises concerns as to whether or not authorities can fund the programme. Additionally, no efforts in labour exploitation prevention were reported in 2019. Several awareness campaigns were carried out in cooperation with NGOs, schools and universities. Conversely, the anti-drug trafficking campaign announced in 2016 failed to develop into a structured plan. Thus, the results of this campaign cannot be considered substantial. Argentina performs rather well in rankings of press freedom on a global scale, yet defamation suits have been used against journalists who have been over-critical of government. These suits have mostly been used to financially strangle the targeted employee or outlet that employs them. Furthermore, while journalists have not been targeted by organized crime, reporters have been victimized by police officers during street protests.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Buenos Aires","GDP (current $US million)":"445445.18","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"44938712","Land Area (sq. km)":"2780400","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"50.1","Freedom in the World Index":"84","Human Development Index":"0.85","Global Peace Index":"1.98","Democracy Index":"6.95","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"42","GDP per capita (current US$)":"9912","1":"4.38","1.1":"3.75","1.2":"5.00","2":"6.33"},{"Corresp":"12","ISO-3":"BHS","Country":"Bahamas","ISO-2":"BS","Continent":"Americas","Region":"Caribbean","Flag file":"bs.png","1.

Evidence suggests that migrant workers on the island, predominantly from Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic are lured to the country with promises of employment through various advertisement channels, but often fall victim to human traffickers upon arrival. Most commonly, victims are exploited in domestic servitude, prostitution and other sectors requiring low-skilled labour. Women appear to be most vulnerable to trafficking, as well as migrant children, irregular migrants and displaced people from the region. Additionally, depending on their parents\u2019 nationalities, children born in The Bahamas may not be eligible for Bahamian citizenship or documentation, which increases their risk of becoming victims of trafficking. Notably, state-embedded actors have been reported to be involved in human trafficking. ##&& Long-standing human smuggling routes transiting through the Bahamas are used by regional migrants as well as those coming from other parts of the world. The Bahamas is part of the route taken by migrants trying to reach the US via Florida. Many migrants go to the far north-west corner of Grand Bahama Island and pay smugglers to take them by boat to Palm Beach County in Florida, a journey of around 95 kilometres. The well-established northward passage and other maritime routes in the southern Bahamas are commonly used for human smuggling. These entry points span an enormous distance of more than 300 nautical miles, from the Turks and Caicos Islands to Cay Lobos. The sheer size of the corridor allows relatively easy evasion of authorities that operate in the south. The Bahamas, as a result, has become a clear transit country for human smuggling. Bahamian transporters have been accused of smuggling nationals from China, Haiti and some African nations into the US. Both foreign and domestic actors are involved in human smuggling, often working with Jamaicans and other island nationals to improve their chances of evading authorities.","text - trade":"Reports suggest that arms and ammunition trafficking in The Bahamas is moderate. The country is predominantly a destination market, with the United States playing a central role in the illegal trans-shipment of weapons. Although there is little indication to suggest arms trafficking is increasing, the illegal market influences other forms of criminality in that guns are a significant factor driving violence in The Bahamas. Available information suggests criminal networks engage in both arms and drug trafficking.","text - environment":"While there is no indication of a flora crimes market in The Bahamas, the country appears to be a source of illegal wildlife trafficked abroad. Allegedly, illegal queen conch from the Bahamian black market is bought and smuggled to the United States and France. The most significant environmental threat, however, is illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, perpetrated mostly by commercial fishing fleets from the Dominican Republic. Commercial fishing of sharks in Bahamian waters has also recently been raised as an issue in local politics. Furthermore, many species, particularly exotic birds and iguanas, are endangered because of the illegal pet trade in the country. There is little evidence to suggest that a non-renewable resource crimes market exists in The Bahamas, however, the island nation was part of an illegal gold smuggling route originating in Venezuela, which suggests vulnerability.","text - drugs":"Seizures of heroin are rare in The Bahamas and local consumption is low. Nevertheless, the local heroin market is fairly large compared to other eastern Caribbean states. It is unclear whether heroin transits the country towards larger consumer markets. The Bahamas has had a long history of cocaine transiting its territories, with cocaine shipments continuing to move through as the eastern Caribbean route has re-emerged in recent years. The drug passes through the archipelago on its way to North America and Europe through the \u2018Medusa\u2019 route - from the Gulf of Mexico via The Bahamas and to North America and Spain in containerized shipments. Although attractive to cartels from Colombia and Venezuela that control the cocaine market, The Bahamas is neither a significant cocaine-producing country, nor a considerable consumer market. Some drugs destined for North America remain in The Bahamas as payment to collaborators for facilitation of the illicit drug trade. To an extent, this has contributed to an increase in local use and a subsequent surge in cocaine and crack cocaine abuse. ##&& Cannabis is grown in the wild in The Bahamas to satisfy mainly domestic demand. Cannabis is arguably the most prevalent illicit drug in the country, with individuals as well as loose networks running the market and selling cannabis to local, at-risk communities. Conversely, the synthetic drug trade is limited and relatively small. However, local demand, generated mostly by tourists, exists and is on the rise. Currently, synthetic drugs are trafficked mainly in mail, making the market manageable, although traffickers may shift their modus operandi to reduce seizures of the goods they smuggle.","text - criminal actors":"The influence of foreign criminal actors in The Bahamas, mainly cocaine traffickers, has been a significant, recurrent theme for the last forty years. There are Colombian crime syndicates operating within the island\u2019s territories, including Los Urabe\u00f1os, Oficina de Envigado, Los Pachenca and the Clan del Oriente. Meanwhile Mexican mafias and the Italian \u2018Ndrangheta are thought to be the leading organizations using The Bahamas as a trans-shipment point for cocaine trafficking. There is moderate interaction between local and foreign criminal actors. Notably, foreign actors use fishing vessels as a central element in the trafficking of drugs between South America, The Bahamas and North America. Evidently, foreign actors control the heroin trade and human trafficking as well as the cocaine business in the country. Local gangs, are an integral part of the criminal landscape in The Bahamas. These entities predominantly attract young people, as youth unemployment is high in the country. The influence of these gangs is rather limited as they are involved in the distribution of cannabis and cocaine to tourists and locals. Nevertheless, ties between gangs and foreign actors are well established. An escalation in violence and even homicide has been seen as local rivalries for turf emerge. ##&& In recent years, the state has had to take action and prosecute individual police officers, prison officers, and other government officials accused of abuses of power and corruption. Evidence, however, that the government exerts control over criminal markets is weak. It is more likely that corrupt officials (mainly in law enforcement and immigration) exert influence rather than it being a state-led enterprise. Similarly, although criminal networks are present in The Bahamas, their impact over the local population is limited.","text - leadership and governance":"The Bahamas is among the more stable countries in the world, with authorities respecting political rights and civil liberties. Nevertheless, criminality has been present on the government's agenda. Despite reforms in the criminal justice system, improved social justice and efforts to reintegrate offenders in society, the nation still faces unacceptable levels of criminal activity. Although corruption perceptions are moderate in global and regional comparisons, and oversight is in place to reduce state corruption, the foundations of these measures are not robust, and the oversight mechanisms are stagnating. The current government has failed to deliver on its anti-corruption campaign agenda and the culture and circumstances that lead to corruption have remained unaddressed. ##&& The Bahamas is party to all relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. There is significant engagement with, and information received from, bi-lateral and multilateral actors, which has heightened response capacity. Interpol\u2019s National Central Bureau (NCB) in the Caribbean is the Bahamas\u2019 primary police platform for sharing global data associated with regional crime. Generally, law enforcement agencies collaborate well with their counterparts, notably in human trafficking and money laundering. The Bahamian legislative framework is well-prepared to respond to contemporary trafficking threats. In addition, amendments to the country's criminal code were implemented in 2014, targeting gangs and organized crime in general.","text - criminal justice and security":"Besides the Special Prosecutorial Unit on Trafficking in Persons, there are no judicial units tasked with tackling organized crime specifically. Nevertheless, the Bahamian justice sector makes use of support from the US in the development of better mechanisms that would allow authorities to effectively investigate and prosecute criminal groups. Efforts are also made to increase the Bahamas Department of Correctional Services' capacity to provide a safe and secure environment for inmates as well as rehabilitative services to former inmates. The long-term effects of these programmes are yet to yield results as currently The Bahamas remains among the countries with the highest incarceration rate in the world. Overcrowding is a major issue, prison conditions arguably violate human rights and recidivism rates remain high. The Royal Bahamas Police comprise a vast number of divisions and special branches throughout the archipelago, including a drug enforcement unit and a trafficking in persons unit. Legislation was passed in 2019, to establish the national crime intelligence agency, but it is not yet operational. Locally, law enforcement authorities are generally distrusted. There are allegations of corruption and abuse of authority against the police force that are under investigation, but the overall weaknesses of the system, such as corruption, are not as glaring nor problematic as those found in other regional forces. The complex geography of the Bahamas \u2013 an archipelago of 700 islands and islets \u2013 impedes comprehensive monitoring, and creates a significant challenge for those tackling drug trafficking and irregular migration. Border control is extremely difficult and staffing levels are nowhere near adequate. Its vulnerability to criminal flows is largely due to its proximity to the US, where cocaine is in high demand.","text - economic and financial environment":"Banks as well as offshore companies in the Bahamas have for long been tied to numerous cases of grand corruption and organized crime. The country\u2019s secrecy laws allow information on offshore accounts to be divulged only by order of the Supreme Court of the Bahamas, which means the country is still a preferred tax haven. That being said, Bahamian authorities have made substantial efforts to strengthen known anti-money laundering vulnerabilities, including measures to enhance international cooperation, initiating a supervision mechanism for non-banking financial institutions and strengthening its legislation on beneficial ownership. There is an operational financial intelligence unit in the country, tasked with obtaining and analyzing information on suspicious transactions. Although The Bahamas is no longer on the EU\u2019s tax blacklist, the country's performance in combating financial crime is of concern, especially in regard to enforcing its anti-money laundering mechanisms. The Bahamian economy is heavily reliant on offshore banking and tourism, with money often laundered through the acquisition of real estate, the purchase of precious metals or stones and also through financial service companies.","text - civil society and social protection":"Authorities maintain serious and sustained victim protection efforts and are fully compliant with minimum requirements for the elimination of modern slavery. Alongside victim support and witness protection programmes, the government has partnered with civil society to implement multifaceted substance abuse intervention aimed at adults and at-risk juveniles, providing drug treatment in a therapeutic environment. Prevention efforts also exist \u2013 a national action plan on prevention of trafficking is in place, along with a formal victim-centred protocol, which serves to assist first-line responders in identifying victims of human trafficking. In practice, however, agencies and organizations that work with communities, victims and perpetrators do not seem to collaborate effectively. Therefore, overall crime prevention efforts boast little success. NGOs operate in the country, some of them engaging in human trafficking prevention and victim support. Although press freedom is generally respected in The Bahamas, defamation is still a crime and the government allegedly favours certain media outlets.

Along with the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Jamaica, Barbados has been recognized as a top sex-tourism destination in the Caribbean. Notably, immigrants who enter the country via legitimate channels from Jamaica, Trinidad and Guyana are especially vulnerable. Additionally, women who search for alternative ways to fend for themselves and their families are at risk of becoming victims of trafficking, as are men who are unemployed, or have experienced job insecurity or low wages. There is no evidence of large organized human trafficking networks operating in Barbados. A degree of organization does exist, but for the most part, one or two Guyanese or Barbadian recruiters work on their own, or on the behalf of businesses. In turn, victims have their documents withheld, experience debt bondage, restriction of movement and low wages as well as physical, verbal and psychological abuse. ##&& Barbados is seen as an attractive destination for migrants, which conditions the existence of a human smuggling market. Smuggling rings use the same boats that import legal commodities from neighbouring countries into Barbados, to smuggle migrants. Because of widespread poverty, the country is vulnerable to external influences. Thus, border security guards are bribed to facilitate human smuggling and allow irregular migrants into the country.","text - trade":"The increasing gang culture has fuelled a demand for firearms that are used to protect and enforce drug markets. Moreover, drugs and stolen goods are often used as a means of payment for arms and ammunition. Arguably, most illegal arms in Barbados are smuggled from the United States, where firearms are easily accessible. It is common for drug traffickers to use associates or family members in the US to purchase arms and smuggle them to Barbados using sea freight. Illegal arms also originate from neighbouring islands as well. Additionally, Barbados is a transit point for regional arms shipments. Although this is not a destabilizing factor yet, legal shipments have gone missing only to turn up in other countries, where they are used to commit crime.","text - environment":"There is no evidence to suggest that either a wildlife crimes market or a non-renewable resource crimes market exists in Barbados. Nevertheless, there are some risks related to money laundering through the purchase of precious metals and gemstones.","text - drugs":"While there have been some instances of heroin use, these have mainly been connected to tourists or migrant workers. Thus, it seems that the heroin market is either very small or non-existent. Conversely, cocaine is easily accessible in the country. At present, Barbados is a smuggling point for the Eastern Caribbean cocaine trade, and is important but not central to that route. The bulk supply of cocaine continues to move from the north coast of Venezuela via go-fast boats and increasingly from Guyana, using general cargo vessels. Barbados\u2019s geographic location poses a logistical problem to traffickers, sitting as it does, further into the Atlantic and outside the normal range of go-fast delivery boats. Deliveries in bulk do still take place but are less common than in other Eastern Caribbean islands. Similar to other Caribbean island nations, cocaine shipments are usually smuggled into Barbados via freight carriers. The loads are for the most part small - about 100-250 kilograms - and originate in Venezuela, Guyana and Trinidad. Once the freighters are near Barbados, the cocaine shipments are offloaded to small boats and carried ashore, where the drugs are either locally distributed or smuggled by courier into larger consumer markets, such as Europe, Canada or the US. To that end, Barbadian diasporas, primarily in the UK, as well as Europe and North America, help facilitate the movement of significant quantities of cocaine. Tourism also plays an important role in cocaine trafficking: relatively wealthy visitors to Barbados keep both demand and prices high; and, allegedly, small quantities of cocaine and heroin have been smuggled on cruise ships to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. It appears state authorities are largely complicit, as criminal actors have admitted bribing customs officials, police officers, judges and politicians. Moreover, growing cocaine demand and use are the primary drivers of increasing violence in the country. ##&& Cannabis is grown locally, but in small quantities, mostly for personal and small-scale consumption. Therefore, St Vincent, which is a significant producer of cannabis in the region, continues to supply the bulk of marijuana to Barbados. Reportedly, local traffickers offload large shipments of 500\u20132000 kilograms from St Vincent delivery vessels a few miles out to sea and bring them to shore under the cover of darkness. Shipments from Jamaica are usually concealed in freight and containers. Local consumption is steady, as is consumption of cannabis by tourists, who pay inflated prices and fuel the demand. Tourists are also the primary consumers of synthetic drugs in Barbados. Despite some evidence for importation and sale of synthetic drugs, the illegal market is not of concern.","text - criminal actors":"Mafia-style organizations, operating as gangs, have a negative influence over diverse sectors of society and their influence is increasing. There are unconfirmed reports of six major gangs in the country, their mafia-like structures constitute highly organized entities, including \u2018dons\u2019 or leaders, hit men and even legitimate businesspeople. These groups typically make use of high-powered rifles. Small gangs include between 15 to 20 people, while larger gangs have up to 50 members. Most gang members tend to be repeat offenders who form relationships while incarcerated. Gangs engage in various forms of criminality including robbery, theft, drug trafficking, firearm possession, serious bodily harm and murder, and operate without fear of prosecution. They focus on protecting their territory, using gang symbols to advertise ownership and arguably exert influence over not only communities, but political circles as well. Cross-border criminal activity tends to also involve criminal networks. The latter often maintain relationships with suppliers, transportation agents as well as buyers. Criminal networks typically engage in drug and gun trafficking but may have a stake in human trafficking and smuggling as well. ##&& State-embedded actors in Barbados are an issue, though now their influence appears to be limited rather than systemic. Allegedly, low-level officials take bribes to facilitate trafficking flows, but information suggests that political circles are under the influence of gang leaders. There is no evidence to suggest that foreign criminal actors operate in Barbados beyond delivering shipments of drugs to the island's territorial waters.","text - leadership and governance":"Leadership and governance exist, however both are at the initial stages of confronting organized crime. This is evident because the country is still in the process of forming a major organized crimes and anti-corruption agency, along with the implementation of the transnational organized crime act in 2011. Although corruption perceptions in the country are low by global standards, concerns among the population are emerging in light of the 2018 elections and the allegations of vote buying, apathy and lack of trust in political leaders. Partly addressing concerns, the government passed a bill in 2020, addressing glaring loopholes in the country's anti-corruption framework, including providing whistle-blower protection provisions and definitions as to what constitutes corruption. ##&& Barbados is party to a number of relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. The country is also an active and prominent participant in numerous law enforcement initiatives. It maintains excellent strategic and tactical relationships with foreign agencies, notably in the area of organized crime and drug trafficking. It continues to work closely with the UK, European countries as well as with the European Union and US agencies and engages with international partners in training initiatives and information sharing. Barbados is member to the Caribbean Community's Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (CARICOM IMPACS), which focuses on strengthening border controls and tackling trafficking flows. In line with its international anti-organized crime commitments, Barbados has implemented legislative reforms to bring national legislation in line with international standards. Most recently, the country made significant anti-corruption and anti-organized crime reforms by implementing the Integrity in Public Life Bill (2020) and the 2016 Trafficking in Persons Prevention Act (TIPPA).","text - criminal justice and security":"The judicial system, modelled on British Law, has become outdated, slow and cumbersome. Consequently, prosecution might take years instead of months, with very few complex cases being heard in court. Thus, drug traffickers are often bailed out or merely fined, while the low count of prosecutions and convictions for human trafficking-related offences in the country is of much concern. Barbados only has one prison, which reportedly meets international standards. The Royal Barbados Police Force (RBPF) is well-resourced and equipped by Caribbean standards. It has a Sex Crimes and Trafficking Unit within its ranks, as well as a Drug Squad. The Barbadian coastguard also works towards countering trafficking flows, alongside the RBPF. Moreover, the government is actively working towards strengthening the police marine unit as well as the coastguard so that they continue to effectively monitor illegal drug flows at sea. Barbados has a coastal radar system that was intended to interdict drug trafficking flows. Yet, the system is not fully functional and as a result, there are significant gaps in coverage, reducing its effectiveness.","text - economic and financial environment":"Barbados is identified as having strategic anti-money laundering deficiencies, but in 2020 has made high-level commitments to enhance its anti-money laundering framework. Some progress has been made, evident in the completion of an initial risk assessment, which concluded that Barbados\u2019 vulnerability to money laundering was related to the pervasive drug market. More comprehensive national risk assessment is being developed to better identify money laundering vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, in 2020 the country was considered by the EU as a non-cooperative jurisdiction for tax purposes. Barbados is the wealthiest economy in the eastern Caribbean as profits from tourism, light Industry, offshore finance as well as information services all make significant contributions to the country\u2019s budget. The economic regulatory environment is moderately conducive to doing business and allegedly, the informal economy in the country is significant, amounting to 30\u201340% of Barbados's GDP.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government has a framework in place to provide support for trafficking victims, but there are significant weaknesses in victim and witness support. There is a formal referral mechanism for victim care, guiding the actions of both authorities and NGOs. Additionally, a Gender Affairs Bureau functions in Barbados to coordinate the victim assistance efforts of the government and civil society. There are shelters for men and women that are managed by NGOs, although lack of funding is an issue which hinders victim support. The TIPPA regulates the safeguards for identities of trafficking victims and identities of their families, along with establishing protection measures during legal proceedings. Not least of all, the Act establishes the right of victims of trafficking to pursue restitution from offenders. Prevention efforts are minimal, with the government only formally reinstating a task force on human trafficking. Prevention mostly depends on public awareness campaigns, although the lack of financing might have hindered the endeavour. No progress has been made in reducing the demand for sex services. Government prevention efforts of drug abuse, center around school awareness-raising campaigns, led by officers from the country\u2019s drug squad and the community relations unit. There are drug rehabilitation clinics, one of which offers treatment to young adults, as well as support mechanisms provided by NGOs in the form of counselling, detoxification, education and prevention programmes. Not least of all, Barbados has a national anti-drug plan, spanning 2015-2020. Journalists are free to report on issues of organized crime and corruption as there is neither censorship, nor governmental control over the media.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Bridgetown","GDP (current $US million)":"5209.00","Income group":"High income","Population":"287025","Land Area (sq. km)":"430","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"47","Freedom in the World Index":"95","Human Development Index":"0.81","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"","Regime Type":"","Corruption Perceptions Index":"64","GDP per capita (current US$)":"18148","1":"3.22","1.1":"2.55","1.2":"3.88","2":"5.71"},{"Corresp":"18","ISO-3":"BLZ","Country":"Belize","ISO-2":"BZ","Continent":"Americas","Region":"Central America","Flag file":"bz.png","1.

Although many independent criminals and regional networks are involved in human trafficking, the market does not have strong ties to complex international human-trafficking operations. Still, victims are recruited and exploited in the country and abroad. The most at-risk groups are females, both Belizean and foreign nationals, children and migrants from Central America, Mexico and Asia. Migrants are exploited in agriculture, domestic and retail work. ##&& In the context of the Central American migrant crisis, estimates indicate a rise in human smuggling in Belize. For the most part, foreign actors based in Central American countries and China seem to run the human-smuggling market in the country, with Belize being the most-preferred destination for undocumented migrants, after the US. The long-standing border dispute between Belize and neighbouring Guatemala has contributed to the country\u2019s vulnerability to trafficking and facilitated irregular entries. Additionally, the Northern El Corozal border crossing is often used by groups to smuggle migrants into Mexico. The El Arenal crossing is another important route, primarily used by Cuban migrants. Allegedly, corruption plays a part in human smuggling in Belize, but no cases have been prosecuted.","text - trade":"Local demand for guns exists, but the market is primarily driven by foreign demand. Belize is, for the most part, a transit point for illicit arms trafficked to neighbouring Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras.Evidence suggests that Mexico-bound weapons coming from the US are trafficked through Belize to avoid strict measures along the US-Mexico border. Most recently, a new arms-trafficking route between Nicaragua and Mexico has been identified. Participation of Belizean groups in the international arms trafficking market appears to be limited, but domestic actors have been known to smuggle arms into Mexico.Although the theft of police and\/or military weapons is not as prevalent in Belize as in other Central American countries, Belizean authorities have identified cases of military members selling weapons to well-known criminals who are linked to gangs.Corrupt officials in Belize, particularly at the borders, facilitate the movement of arms through the country. The illicit arms market has contributed to the easy access of arms, which has, in turn, become a reason for the high percentage of firearm-inflicted homicides in the country.","text - environment":"Independent criminals allegedly pay local community members to cut down Honduran rosewood, which is then smuggled to China for the production of luxury furniture and musical instruments. Related to the illicit harvest, there have been reports of Guatemalan loggers illegally entering Belize to participate in the illegal economy. The environmental effect has been significant -a loss of 90% in Honduran rosewood fields was recorded until 2010. Conversely, the illicit fauna market in Belize exists mainly to satisfy domestic demand. Endangered parrot, monkey and turtle species are persistently poached and sold in the country as pets. No evidence suggests any transnational links.Although smaller by regional comparison, an illegal gold-extraction market exists in Belize, with independent Guatemalans allegedly involved in illegal gold mining. Notably, gold is not extracted on site, but rather ore containing flecks of gold is smuggled into Guatemala and extracted there. The market has a significant effect on the environment, evident in severe deforestation and soil damage.","text - drugs":"Belize serves as a transit point for heroin bound for the US and Mexico. Mexican cartels control heroin flows through the country and might hire local Belizeans to smuggle the drug into Mexico and the US. Nevertheless, few heroin seizures have been recorded, which might suggest a downward trend in heroin use in destination markets and a limited demand for heroin in Belize. Similarly, it is primarily a transit point for cocaine on the way to Mexico and the US, smuggled by air and sea from Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador, but a small domestic consumption of cocaine exists as well. In recent years, Belize has seen an increase in drug flights landing on clandestine airstrips, especially in the tourist Ambergris Caye district, the country\u2019s largest island, and in the northern Orange Walk district near the Mexican border. The low population density and the clandestine strips make it perfect for cargo planes used for smuggling to land or refuel. The country\u2019s islands \u2212 and its authorities\u2019 inability to patrol them \u2212 create opportunities for go-fast vessels to move drugs and other illicit goods through Belize\u2019s territorial waters. Mostly foreign actors appear to control the cocaine trade. However, Belizean gangs have reportedly begun fighting over the movement of cocaine, prompting a series of drug-related homicides on land and at sea. ##&& Cannabis use in Belize is considerable, with locals and tourists using the drug. Local gangs are believed to control the trade, distributing cannabis grown domestically, as well as a more-expensive marijuana variety smuggled from Mexico. Corruption is arguably a key element in the cannabis trade as high-level police and other officials have been arrested for facilitating the market. Belize is used as a transit point for chemical precursors \u2212 used in synthetic drug production \u2212 destined for Mexico. Belizeans are hired to move the precursors that originate from Asia to transit through European countries (Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, etc.). However, precursors coming from Guatemala have been seized as well. The seizures might indicate a growing local market for precursors that is dominated by gangs.","text - criminal actors":"Although more than 40 street gangs have been identified in Belize City, eight of them appear to be most prominent, all modelled on the notorious US Bloods and Crips gangs. Due to various factors, identifying leadership is difficult. However, charges have been brought against influential figures in these groups.There are allegedly 900 to 1400 gang membersin Belize City, with the three largest gangs being the Peace in the Valley Bloods, the South Side Gangs and the Gaza New Generation Blood\/George Street Gang. Gangs hold substantial territorial control with some areas being offlimits to authorities. These mafia-style groups control various criminal markets, such as distribution of cannabis and crack cocaine, which contribute to a significant degree of violence, including that perpetratedwith firearms and grenades.Notably, prominent gang leaders operate with impunity and have a stake in the legal economy or relations with political elites. Foreign actors also operate in Belize. Among the most renowned are the Sinaloa Cartel and MS13, as well as groups from Ecuador. These organizations tend to play a more important role in transnational organized-crime activities, such as arms, cocaine and chemical-precursor trafficking, but domestic groups have started taking a more direct role in transnational activities as well. Information suggests authorities engage with and facilitate criminal operations in Belize. Besides allegations of high-profile politicians tied to organized crime, evidence suggests police and military officials participatein criminal economies at various levels.Belize\u2019s strong relationship with the criminal regime in Venezuela has supported the claims of Belizean authorities being complicit in organized crime. Lastly, criminal networks also exist in the country, but these are smallscale and mostly hired to smuggle chemical precursors to and through Belize. These networks are concentrated in the main cities of the country - Belize City and San Pedro,and might overlap with Mexican crime networks.","text - leadership and governance":"Former political leaders have had strong ties to organized crime and corruption has been flagged as an issue in the country. After mounting pressures, Belize signed the UN Convention against Corruption, but implementation is still problematic. Overall, anti-organized crime has not featured strongly on the political agenda of the country. The 2020 elections resulted in the People\u2019s United Party winning a landslide victory but it remains to be seen what stance the new government will take on organized crime. Nevertheless, since gaining independence, Belize has been politically relatively stable. With the worrying levels of corruption, however, a general lack of transparency has been signalled in various reports and surveys and public access to information is somewhat restricted. ##&& Belize is party to most international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. In addition, the country receives assistance from the UK and the US in different areas, including in anti-organized crime, with the US Southern Command supporting Belize with humanitarian assistance, training and exercise programmes, as well as with equipment and technology. Security partnerships with other countries in the region are also established. While on paper international cooperation is sound, corruption interferes with the country\u2019s security efforts. Although the country\u2019s national laws and policies are in line with Belize\u2019s international commitments, most laws are rarely enforced and have little impact.","text - criminal justice and security":"Due to the country\u2019s colonial history, Belize has an accusatory legal system based on British practice, albeit with some variations. Even though Belize collaborates with the US to improve its criminal justice information management system, justice is slow \u2212 more than a third of inmates are held in pre-trial detention without being convicted. In addition, the justice system is allegedly inefficient; high-profile organized-crime-related cases are often dismissed due to political influence. Conversely, the penal system has markedly improved since 2000 and inmates now have adequate housing, functioning sewer infrastructure and showers. The US in particular has assisted Belize, financially and technologically, but corruption in the country remains an obstacle to effective law enforcement. A mobile interdiction team, an interagency border security unit, was established in 2012. The unit has the task of interdicting illicit drugs and other contraband trafficked within and across the country\u2019s points of entry, but its members are detailed to police units, leaving fewer resources to monitor the borders.","text - economic and financial environment":"Despite reforming its tax regime and being removed from the EU\u2019s tax-haven blacklist, Belize remains highly vulnerable to money laundering. Evidence points to foreign actors using the country to launder money since at least 2012, while malfeasance in the highest echelons of the country\u2019s tax service persists. Belize has made use of US technical assistance to the country\u2019s semi-autonomous interagency group mandated to investigate and prosecute illicit financial transactions, the Financial Intelligence Unit, and has expanded staffing, training and interagency cooperation. The unit, however, has little to show for in terms of prosecuted cases. In addition, doing business in Belize is difficult because the country\u2019s economic regulatory capacity is not conducive to entrepreneurship.","text - civil society and social protection":"Under its 2018-2020 action plan against human trafficking, Belize is developing a comprehensive system of victim-assistance services. Although victim identification has improved, certain gaps persist, for example authorities disregarding credible reports by NGOs of potential trafficking. A victim identification and assistance protocol specific to migrant children has been drafted in collaboration with an international partner. There is a programme in Belize \u2212 the Conscious Youth Development Programme \u2212 that provides psychosocial support as well as conflict mediation to young people involved with gangs, and their families, but support measures, overall, are quite limited. In terms of prevention, under the same 2018-2020 action plan, authorities have made a commitment to reduce both demand for and vulnerability to human trafficking, to conduct country-specific research on the issue, as well as track and assess how human trafficking-related policies are being implemented. Enhancing its investigative and prosecutorial capacities using a victim-centred approach is on the agenda of the action plan. Drug-prevention efforts \u2212 reducing the supply-and-demand and beefing up control measures \u2212 are guided by the country\u2019s health ministry\u2019s National Drug Abuse Control Council. The council provides assistance to special projects that focus on the training of experts in prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of drug abuse. Yet, while prevention mechanisms exist, they do not seem to have been well-implemented in practice. Belize performs relatively well in press freedom, but the media environment has worsened since 2014. Media polarization makes coverage of sensitive issues controversial, while threats, harassment and intimidation of journalists occur occasionally.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Belmopan","GDP (current $US million)":"1879.61","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"390353","Land Area (sq. km)":"22970","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"64.2","Freedom in the World Index":"87","Human Development Index":"0.72","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"","Regime Type":"","Corruption Perceptions Index":"","GDP per capita (current US$)":"4815","1":"4.64","1.1":"4.40","1.2":"4.88","2":"3.13"},{"Corresp":"21","ISO-3":"BOL","Country":"Bolivia","ISO-2":"BO","Continent":"Americas","Region":"South America","Flag file":"bo.png","1.

Bolivian nationals, namely women and children, are also trafficked to Argentina, Brazil, Panama and Chile. Victims are subject to forced begging, sexual exploitation and organ trafficking by national and transnational mafias. Forced prostitution and child labour is rampant in Bolivian and Peruvian illegal mining settlements, and Bolivian women are also exploited in the tourist town of Piura. Local criminal networks control victims and are known to threaten their relatives, as well as public officers. ##&& Although human smuggling is not significant in Bolivia, the market interacts with other criminal markets such as human and drug trafficking. Bolivia is a transit country for people from Africa, who are smuggled to the US, as well as a transit and destination country for people smuggled from Chile and the Caribbean.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking groups, predominantly from Brazil and Paraguay, use Bolivia as a transit country. The international arms trafficking route starts in Miami, in the US, and flows via the Dominican Republic to Peru or Chile and through Bolivia, with Brazil or Paraguay the final destinations. While arms are accessible to local groups, the primary markets are, as noted, Brazil or Paraguay. Criminal groups operating in Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Peru may exchange arms at border crossing points, and criminal organizations are known to arm their members and raid Bolivian military bases. This market is key for other criminal market operations, including drug trafficking, and may be enabled by low-level corruption. Furthermore, violence frequently linked to criminal activity is rising, especially in cities.","text - environment":"Bolivia has one of the highest global deforestation levels as a result of illegal logging, and the clearing of land for agriculture and livestock, driven by exports to China. The Santa Cruz department is currently the most deforested area, but forced labour of loggers also occurs in the Amazon rainforest where illegal activities affect indigenous tribes and have resulted in the murder of indigenous leaders and activists. Bolivia has a wood trade deficit due in part to illicit trafficking, which is facilitated by scarce infrastructure, corruption and a lack of park ranger equipment. In the Amazon region, unarmed rangers do three patrols annually, but loggers are usually armed with carbines. Bolivia is also a source, destination and transit country for wildlife specimens from neighbouring countries, perhaps facilitating illegal wildlife trade between Brazil and Peru. This mainly concerns live specimens for the pet trade, and products for consumption, traditional use, or religious festivals, including lizards, freshwater turtles, parrots, llamas, vicunas as well as alpaca wool or meat. Most illegal fauna imports, such as birds, are traded on the local market or Facebook, and smuggling is enabled by porous borders, lax prosecution laws and social acceptance. ##&& The primary non-renewable resource crimes in Bolivia are illegal mining and natural gas and gasoline smuggling to neighbouring countries. Regarding the latter, micro-trafficking to Peru, Chile, Brazil and Paraguay is significant. Gold mining is part of the ancient Bolivian culture, and the main criminal actors are local illegal miners or jukus, who recruit legitimate mineworkers or bribe officers to let them steal metal or tools from mines, usually smuggling Peruvian gold to bigger markets. Illegal mining mostly occurs where violence and other crimes, such as human, drug and arms trafficking are prevalent. Gold is illegally transported by 'mules', shielded vehicles, motorcycles and planes. ","text - drugs":"In Bolivia, the heroin trade pales in comparison to cannabis, the most consumed drug, and cocaine, the most produced and trafficked drug. Bolivia is one of the top cocaine producers in the world, and it is legal to grow and consume coca leaves for cultural reasons. Bolivia is also a transit country for Peruvian and Colombian cocaine. As domestic cocaine consumption is low, most profit is generated by external demand. Mexican and Colombian cartels control trafficking routes towards Chile, Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina, from where cocaine is also sent to Europe. However, Bolivian criminal organizations are also involved in smuggling coca base to Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, sometimes by plane. Significantly, associated violence has risen in some cities and regions, such as Santa Cruz, but coca cultivation has also provided a lifeline for poorer sectors during past recessions. ##&& Although cannabis is the most frequently used illegal drug, only a fraction of the market is covered by local production. Bolivia is therefore also a transit and destination country for cannabis, and Colombian organizations facilitate trafficking via Peru with a loose structure of hired hands. Small family groups in the Tarija department transit cannabis through the southern part of the country, primarily from Paraguay to northern Chile, and informal low-level groups manage local trade. Synthetic drug consumption is low, and pharmaceuticals, such as tramadol, benzodiazepine products and amphetamines require prescriptions and are relatively costly. These substances enter from Brazil and Argentina, making Bolivia a transit country. Lately, Chinese LSD has entered the market, and there has been an increase in consumption in elite high schools.","text - criminal actors":"Leaders of drug clans, as well as their relatives and allies, have held political positions, and the Bolivian police and other institutions are involved in corruption, bribery and drug trafficking at all levels. The main bribery recipients are the judiciary, police, and customs. Low-level corruption in smuggling and drug trafficking increased with a lack of civilian oversight during the interim government (2019\u20132020). A lack of capacity and resources undermine institutions, while low salaries, and an overstaffed and unprofessional bureaucracy create incentives for corruption, clientelism, and patronage. ##&& The main foreign criminal actors in Bolivia include the Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), Commando Vermelho, Bandas Criminales (BACRIM), the Sinaloa Cartel, the New Generation Jalisco Cartel, and the Italian mafia-style group 'Ndrangheta. The PCC sends emissaries across the extensive, poorly monitored border, and has an agreement with the Commando Vermelho in respect to Santa Cruz and the Pando region. Moreover, due to corruption and the absence of state institutions, San Mat\u00edas is part of a major drug trafficking corridor for Bolivian cocaine entering Brazil. Meanwhile, BACRIM controls Bolivian cocaine processing laboratories and trafficking routes from Peru to Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina and Chile. Bolivian producers mostly sell coca base, and Colombian and Brazilian actors control refinement processes. Although foreign mafia-style groups use Bolivia to purchase or transit drugs, they do not control territory, nor do they have a permanent, high-level presence. While local organizations are smaller and easily replaced, family clans in the Beni department, such as the Candia Castedo, Lima Lobo and the Rodr\u00edguez clans, have existed for decades and maintain shifting relationships with international organizations. They control coca base trans-shipment via small planes to Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, for local consumption or export to Europe and North Africa.","text - leadership and governance":"The drug policy \u2018Coca S\u00ed, Coca\u00edna No\u2019 initiated by former president Evo Morales focused on legalizing and industrializing coca leaf plantations. Previous forced eradication policies led to human rights abuses, and Morales' approach recognized that growers\u2019 involvement in illicit trade is primarily driven by economic necessity. Morales saw shortcomings in the administration of justice and health services, and generally, the government demonstrated opposition to organized crime and corruption, although corruption scandals, marshalling challenges and a lack of action tempered success. In his fourth term, Morales announced the creation of the council for the fight against corruption, to complement the vice ministry of institutional transparency and fight against corruption. Human rights were severely threatened under the interim government led by Jeanine A\u00f1ez following Morales\u2019 resignation, including through the sanctioning of the use of lethal force against nonviolent pro-Morales protestors, and the passing of a supreme decree removing significant limitations on the permissible actions of the security forces. Subsequently, the new government of Luis Arce was elected in November 2020, and has vowed to not allow Morales to be hugely influential. The political instability caused by abrupt changes to government in the past two years has created uncertainty and a degree of discontinuity with regard to public policies. In general, Bolivia performs below regional governance averages, and there is evidence of drug dealers having held key political positions. ##&& Bolivia has extradition treaties with Argentina, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, Belgium, the US, Spain, Brazil, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Venezuela, Peru and the Southern Common Market. During Morales' presidency, Bolivia failed to extradite criminals to Argentina and Brazil, and concerns arose regarding judicial delays benefiting the accused. Despite the fact that in 2008 Morales expelled the US Drug Enforcement Administration from the country, until 2019, Bolivia actively participated in regional and international agreements regarding drugs and trade. Although the interim government reopened diplomatic relations with the US, there are concerns that this will negatively affect the legal coca market. While the state is party to international agreements to fight organized crime, compliance is weak. For instance, Bolivian officers working with INTERPOL deleted the Red Notice for one of the most wanted drug traffickers in Bolivia. Bolivian national law covers human trafficking and smuggling, drug trafficking, coca production, flora and fauna crimes, arms trafficking and non-renewable resource crimes, although weaknesses exist regarding flora and non-renewable resource crimes. While logging is a crime, the trafficking or the transportation of illegal wood is an administrative offence. Regarding non-renewable resource crimes, the law may promote illegal mining by giving rights to anyone requesting an area for exploitation without considering indigenous communities as mining actors. Since it is relatively easy to obtain permits to exploit mines, miners often do not comply with exploitation, labour and environmental norms. Notably, the law that legalizes coca plantations is an example of legislation which has yielded better results in Bolivia than in Colombia and Peru.","text - criminal justice and security":"The Bolivian judicial system is considered an obstacle to fighting crime because of delayed criminal procedures and pervasive corruption among lawyers, prosecutors and judges, who profit from victims. Severe prison overcrowding is exacerbated by arbitrary and politically motivated arrests; most prisoners are pre-trial detainees, and the entire prison system suffers a lack of medical and security personnel. The ratio of police officers to citizens also falls short of international standards as a result of political interference, low salaries and pensions, poor working conditions and inadequate training. There are a number of specialized units, with mandates including crime, drug trafficking and environmental crime, and although the annual budget has increased, problems persist due to the lack of equipment as well as corruption. In general, public perception of the police is negative. The country shares borders with Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Paraguay and Chile, but despite investments made, most borders are highly vulnerable with many irregular crossing points available to facilitate illegal flows.","text - economic and financial environment":"Bolivia is one of the poorest countries in the region, with growth heavily dependent on government investment and on income generated from hydrocarbons and has one of the world\u2019s largest informal economies. The country is at significant risk of asset laundering and terrorism financing, and the financial investigations unit of the ministry of economy and public finance is tasked with controlling money laundering. In 2012, Bolivia created a national council to combat illicit laundering of profits which was tasked with setting out guidelines and policies to best combat money laundering, and in 2013, new regulatory procedures were created, allowing for the freezing and confiscation of criminal proceeds. Bolivian criminal courts have jurisdiction over money laundering and related offences, and can request information from banks for investigative purposes.","text - civil society and social protection":"Bolivian law mandates the protection of victims and witnesses by the office of the prosecutor general, the police and the ministry of justice. There is an office for victim protection and assistance per department, delivered by the Servicio Plurinacional de Asistencia a la V\u00edctima. With regards to prevention, the social control policy for coca has been lauded for reducing cultivation and violence, however, the policy's future remains undetermined. Meanwhile, United Nations initiatives in Bolivia focus on coca, development, health and drugs\u2019 oversight, prevention, organized crime, corruption and criminal justice reform. Notably, efforts to promote wildlife protection and counter human trafficking, also exist in the country. A council chaired by the Ministry of Justice was responsible for coordinating anti-trafficking efforts at the national level, but due to blurred lines and a lack of clear and distinct mandates with other units involved in combating human trafficking, cooperation on the matter is poor. Nevertheless, a national action plan was in place throughout 2020 and work progressed on the development of the 2021\u20132025 national action plan. It has been noted by various civil society organizations that under the transitional government they have enjoyed increased cooperation with government officials on trafficking issues. The development of a federal registry obliging employment agencies to document their activities has successfully reduced the extent to which these agencies were able to exploit workers. ##&& The media is the main non-state actor denouncing corruption and crime, but there is little investigative journalism, and accounts can be sensationalist or based on unverified information.

Brazilian nationals are victims of trafficking domestically as well as internationally, especially to Spain, Portugal and the United States. Although rarely reported, sexual and labour exploitation, illegal international adoptions and organ trafficking have been recorded. The perpetrators of these crimes are often relatives or friends of the victims, hired by agricultural, industrial or sex-work networks. ##&& While historically a transit and source country, Brazil has also become a destination country for human smuggling. Socio-economic and political circumstances in Latin America have generated increased migration flows, with the arrival of Bolivians, Venezuelans, Peruvians and Haitians in Brazil giving rise to nationalism. The northern Brazilian states were severely affected during the Venezuelan exodus by irregular entrance routes and the forging of documents by smugglers and coyotes. Brazil is a transit country for Cubans, Haitians and others, as well as a source country for those travelling to the US. Large smuggling rings originating in Africa, the Middle East and Asia were recently dismantled.","text - trade":"Brazil is one of the largest producers and exporters of small weapons, many of which are smuggled back into the country from Paraguay, the US, Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia and Uruguay. Higher-calibre guns sourced from legal US markets and smuggled via Paraguay or directly to Brazil are used for organized crime, illegal police action and self-defence. ##&& Brazil is also an exporter of illegal arms, including to Yemen; and its air and sea ports are highly vulnerable to arms trafficking. Many civilian-owned arms are unregistered and the market is plagued by a lack of transparency, inefficiency and corruption. Firearms seized by the police are rarely indexed, but are rather \u2018lost\u2019, \u2018misplaced\u2019 or stolen. ##&& The illegal market is controlled primarily by corrupt military and police officers, as well as by transnational crime networks and gangs involved in trafficking across South America. Illegal firearms are readily available, especially to young criminals and organized groups. High homicide rates and violence between criminal actors and security forces are attributed mainly to illegal firearms. ","text - environment":"Illegal timber extraction and biopiracy, facilitated by corruption, are significant in Brazil. In the Amazon and Atlantic forests, biopiracy involves scientists, pharmaceutical companies and the food industry. Most timber exported from the Amazon is illegally sourced, with exports destined primarily for the US, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, Japan and the United Kingdom. Extraction, which is often followed by the raising of cattle, involves parallel support activities and large criminal networks, with legal companies often also getting involved in irregular practices. Furthermore, in 2020, forest fires across Brazil\u2019s Amazon increased considerably since the previous year and a significant proportion of the fires were set deliberately, and illegally, by farmers and other agricultural workers as a means of converting rainforest into arable land. In July 2020, revelations that a government official in Brazil had deliberately abandoned the issuing of fines for illegal deforestation has been described as a \u2018flashpoint\u2019 for Brazil\u2019s deforestation crisis. ##&& The Amazon's criminal actors are responsible for murders and violence, particularly of\/towards indigenous people, activists and the authorities. Brazil is one of the main origins of illegally traded fauna, especially birds. The market involves individuals who sell fauna to supplement their income. They supply large domestic and international criminal networks, which use corruption and bribery to forge documents and bypass inspections. Fauna including anacondas, turtles, macaws, toucans and snakes is trafficked to the US and Europe for private collectors, scientific purposes, the fashion and souvenir industries, and to be kept as pets. Although the trade endangers ecosystems and risks the spreading of diseases, it is socially accepted. ##&& A boom in illegal mining for Amazonian gold relies on small-scale miners and larger criminal networks. The illegal market for emeralds, imperial topaz and diamonds is also substantial, with the latter being sold in France, Switzerland and Italy. Brazil is a transit country for gold and diamonds, connecting Venezuela and French Guyana. Venezuelan gold is sometimes legalized in Brazil and exported to India and the United Arab Emirates. The current gold-mining boom is facilitated by permissiveness and the COVID-19 pandemic. Illegal mining causes deforestation, erosion and water contamination, with associated violence, human trafficking and drug smuggling all reported on protected and indigenous Amazonian lands. ","text - drugs":"Although Brazil\u2019s cocaine trade is one of largest in the world, it is primarily sourced from Andean countries and trafficked to Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Oceania. The domestic market and demand for cocaine base (coca paste) are considerable. Cocaine is the main driver of organized crime, feeding corruption, homicides, money laundering, border-monitoring difficulties and lethal violence perpetrated by criminal groups and security forces. ##&& For decades, local elites from the border regions have competed with criminal groups to control Brazil\u2019s wholesale cocaine routes. The profits from these operations go to these elites and criminal groups, as well as to illegal state-security markets, Colombian transnational criminal organizations and mafias. While middle-class markets are nonviolent, the urban outskirts and poor neighbourhoods have large and often-violent markets. ##&& Brazil has the largest cannabis market in Latin America. While some actors also sell cocaine, the two drugs have separate middle- and elite-class circuits. Brazil used to produce a great portion of its cannabis, but following consumption increases, Paraguay has become the main source. S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are consumption hubs for imported cannabis, while Colombian cannabis is also traded in the north. Large criminal groups conquered the wholesale market, later also controlling cultivation, but several networks and individuals participate in retail. ##&& While heroin consumption is sparse in Brazil, occasional seizures indicate that it is used as a transit country, with foreign actors leading transactions. The synthetic-drug market is not prevalent, and use remains limited to the upper-middle and elite classes. A limited amount of international trade occurs on the internet, and domestic networks are involved in small makeshift factories. LSD, Ecstasy and other drugs infrequently come from Europe to Brazil in exchange for cocaine. Brazil has a high incidence of legal pharmaceutical drugs being smuggled from Paraguay. In the Tri-Border Area (TBA) several types of criminal actors are responsible for the market chain.","text - criminal actors":"The most powerful criminal organization in Brazil, Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), inspired by the Comando Vermelho (CV), was formed as a self-protection group for prisoners. Both organizations exert control from inside prison through corrupt officials and are involved in drug sales, extortion and the supply of public services in marginalized areas. Their significant access to weapons has contributed to state-wide violence, prison riots and massacres. During previous elections, federal forces were called upon to police these groups. The PCC, which is also active in Paraguay, is also involved in bank and car robberies, kidnappings and money laundering. ##&& White-collar crime groups operate as mafias in Brazil, facilitating corruption and money laundering. Militias, which often include police officers, are involved in extortion and the extrajudicial killing of political candidates. They also control gas supply, public transportation, rented property and illegal gambling. These paramilitary groups are believed to be behind recent political violence. Although predominantly urban, they are hired by businesses and landowners in rural areas to forcefully drive out residents. ##&& State-actor participation in criminal markets is key to their success, as illustrated by the militias\u2019 use of state resources, and their financing and appointing of political candidates, as well as their coercion of voters. White-collar crimes, including the negotiation of public contracts, also involve government officials. With regard to foreign actors, the TBA and Amazon regions are home to domestic and foreign criminal activity. Foreign networks, especially those controlling drug markets in destination countries, use domestic actors as facilitators.","text - leadership and governance":"Although organized crime has been a government priority, Brazil is unable to provide governance in many low-income urban areas. Strategies to tackle political and developmental failures are lacking, and the overwhelming number of legal cases has led to impunity. Current counter-organized-crime initiatives focus on punitive strategies and militarized operations. Some of President Jair Bolsonaro's policies on relaxing legislation related to the possession of weapons and incentivizing mining in indigenous lands are likely to have had a negative impact on security. Historically, Brazil suffers from corruption, with political leadership exercised through patronage systems and congressional give-and-take deals. Levels of violence throughout the country remained high, with homicides increasing in 2020 on the previous year and attacks on politicians escalating during municipal elections in November. ##&& Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous allegations of corrupt practices have been made regarding high-level state officials and public-procurement processes. The democratic process has been captured by criminal organizations, with members of the PCC and CV crime groups suspected of running as electoral candidates. Although courts are independent and clash frequently with Brazil\u2019s executive branch, they have been accused of political bias in anti-corruption operations and their instruments of prosecution are not very effective in deterring corruption or organized crime. While access to information appears robust, there has been a notable decline in transparency generally in almost all areas, including with regard to public health, the environment and public security, among others. ##&& Brazil has signed and ratified numerous treaties and conventions regarding arms, drug and human trafficking, and has extradition agreements with a number of countries, as well as a Southern Common Market agreement. Brazil also has cooperation agreements with international agencies and governments, as well as domestic laws and institutions related to fighting organized crime. The General Prosecutor\u2019s Office, courts, media and human-rights organizations are generally independent and able to investigate political corruption and criminal violence. ##&& Regulatory and procedural legislation is generally robust, although the judiciary lacks capacity and suffers from inefficiency, corruption and patronage. Brazil\u2019s penal code outlaws criminal associations, and other laws are in place to combat transnational criminal organizations, environmental crimes, unauthorized weaponry, drug trafficking, money laundering, the adulteration of medicines and food, and human exploitation. ","text - criminal justice and security":"Regardless of the shortcomings within the judicial system, including high levels of corruption and political overreach into the judiciary, institutions including the Attorney General\u2019s Office and the federal police seem fairly effective in investigating crime. Prisons, however, suffer from overcrowding and high pre-trial detention rates. Although a special detention regime exists for members of criminal groups, the precarious conditions in many of Brazil\u2019s prisons have contributed to their being controlled by criminals. Additionally, the expansion of criminalization policies and militarized police strategies have not been accompanied by corresponding judicial-processing capacities. Although their budget is comparatively high, the police are underequipped when it comes to investigating organized crime. Specialized counter-organized-crime units exist within the military police, the federal police and the Rio de Janeiro police. The national force, consisting of police and firefighters, assists in volatile situations, including elections. However, militarized public-security approaches have resulted in low public trust, compounded by inefficient cooperation between Brazil\u2019s various police forces. In June 2020, the Supreme Court announced a ban on police raids in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s favelas amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but the ruling was often ignored by police forces and hundreds of people were killed. ##&& Brazil\u2019s extremely porous borders, shared with 10 countries, feature jungles, rivers and lakes, encompassing major transnational drug-trafficking routes. The TBA represents a major cluster of criminal activity, particularly for the smuggling of drugs and other illegal goods. The Attorney General\u2019s Office and the federal police have apprehended criminals operating in this area, yet criminal activity remains extensive. The armed forces have long-standing plans to build a border-monitoring infrastructure, but the authorities also face challenges trying to maintain an effective presence elsewhere, particularly in inner-city areas.","text - economic and financial environment":"Brazil is at moderate risk for money laundering and terrorist financing. It has a good track record in prosecuting cases involving criminal organizations and high-level corruption, and its anti-money-laundering laws have been modified in a bid to improve prosecution for the concealment of goods, but overall, the state\u2019s capacity to investigate money laundering remains low. Although the institution dealing with suspicious financial transactions has been praised, accountability is still a concern. ##&& Businesses are permitted to register online and the sharing of information has improved. Although the government has taken steps to simplify bureaucracy, reform the pension systems and prosecute tax avoidance, Brazil\u2019s complex laws and regulations, high taxes and bureaucracy have resulted in slow economic growth. Overall, the state\u2019s capacity to regulate the economy effectively is relatively low, as evidenced by the sizeable informal economy which facilitates the growth and development of organized criminal actors.","text - civil society and social protection":"While Brazil has programmes that provide support, healthcare and psychological assistance for the victims and witnesses of crime, more could be done to assist those trying to escape from what essentially amounts to modern-day slavery. Crime victims are sometimes treated as criminals themselves, or are even killed by the police. Furthermore, while a witness protection programme exists, it is not effective in practice. Campaigns to raise awareness about fauna-related crimes, as well as drug and human trafficking, have been developed by government and non-state institutions, which work with the congress and senate to support changes in legislation. However, complex prevention mechanisms including socio-economic development policies are rare, and prisons and gated communities continue to host crime bosses. Furthermore, attorneys working in the Amazon have consistently noted the difficulties in preventing illicit activity in the region, due in part to a lack of agreements in place and cooperation between the state and the private sector. ##&& Civil-society organizations in urban areas provide legal advice, education and health services as a response to state neglect. Elsewhere, activists and indigenous leaders who fight to protect the environment are subject to harassment and killings. The media and non-governmental organizations have criticized the state\u2019s security forces for heavy-handed operations against organized crime; and although the media consistently denounces corruption, its coverage of organized crime is weak. Brazil is one of Latin America\u2019s most violent countries for the media, with journalists often being the victims of threats, attacks and assassinations. Investigative journalists are often subjected to abusive judicial proceedings and attacks on their sources. Media ownership remains concentrated in the hands of large business families with close connections to the political elite.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Brasilia","GDP (current $US million)":"1839758.04","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"211049527","Land Area (sq. km)":"8515770","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"75.8","Freedom in the World Index":"74","Human Development Index":"0.77","Global Peace Index":"2.41","Democracy Index":"6.92","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"38","GDP per capita (current US$)":"8717","1":"6.50","1.1":"6.50","1.2":"6.50","2":"5.04"},{"Corresp":"32","ISO-3":"CAN","Country":"Canada","ISO-2":"CA","Continent":"Americas","Region":"North America","Flag file":"ca.png","1.

A disproportionate percentage of sex-trafficking victims are indigenous women or women of descent, and the overwhelming majority of human-trafficking cases involving Canada consist of internal trafficking. While the COVID-19 pandemic has reportedly affected the nature of sex trafficking, it has not hindered the overall market. Transnational human trafficking, on the other hand, comes primarily in the form of forced labour. ##&& Canada is a transit country for individuals smuggled into the United States, often in groups based on ethnicity or origin. A significant percentage are Mexican and Romanian nationals, who do not require visas to enter Canada. Tighter restrictions along the US\u2013Mexico border have increased this phenomenon. Smugglers primarily operate along Canada\u2019s south-eastern border,operating as independent opportunistic actors or in organized networks. ","text - trade":"Traditionally, the arms-trafficking market has relied heavily on imports from the US. While this continues to pose a threat, recent years have seen a surge in internal trafficking through the illicit sale of legally obtained firearms to criminals. Nevertheless, overall, the arms-trafficking market is not pervasive in the country; Canada is not a significant source country and the societal impact of the market is limited, with murder rates remaining low compared to other countries in the Americas.","text - environment":"Canada plays a role as both a transit and destination country in the transnational illegal wildlife trade. The polar-bear trade is legal only in Canada,where prices have increased exponentially over the last decade. Narwhal hunting, legal among Inuit populations, places the species at risk of overharvesting, and narwhal and walrus tusks are illegally sold in Europe and East Asia. Bear gallbladders, believed to have healing powers, are also trafficked to Asia. Seizures of illegally trafficked fauna and by-products (e.g. Dall sheep) have risen significantly in the last two years, and include serval cats, pythons, Asian donkeys and snakes intended for the pet trade. The country is also a destination country for illegal wildlife products, especially for trafficked turtles. ##&& Domestically, the illegal logging and timber trade is insignificant, largely due to strong legislation, policies, consumer choice and the monitoring of Canada's timber supply chain and ports by officials, but an illicit market for Canadian timber products and orchids has been reported in the US. With regard to non-renewable resource crimes, although artisanal mining exists, there are no illicit extractive industries. Canada holds a significant share of the international diamond market, reputed to be conflict-free and cleanly mined. However, gold from Venezuela is trafficked via neighbouring countries to refiners in Canada using false paperwork. Canadian multinationals are involved in environmental crimes and human-rights abuses worldwide, with a decades-long lack of accountability in Canada. ","text - drugs":"Cannabis has been legalized in Canada for medical and recreational consumption, as has home-based cultivation for personal use. Many suppliers are government operated, with private enterprises involved in some provinces. However, commercial production fails to cover national demand, and legal cannabis is reportedly more expensive and lower in quality than illicit cannabis. As such, organized criminal groups continue to be involved in illicit cannabis production and sale. Domestic MDMA (Ecstasy) and crystal-meth production has surged, as has the importation of their chemical precursors. Synthetic-drug production is concentrated in greater Vancouver, where commercial marine ports are alsoused to import fentanyl from China, with heavy involvement by Chinese criminal networks and outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMCGs). Fentanyl consumption and resulting deaths are rising, especially among heroin users, causing thousands of deaths annually \u2013 with cases of the two drugs being mixed. ##&& Heroin is smuggled in via marine ports, airports, and by post from Southern Asia and, to a lesser extent, Mexico. As with synthetic drugs, Chinese criminal networks are the predominant heroin traffickers on Canada\u2019s western coast, while Middle Eastern criminal groups are allegedly more active in central provinces (e.g. Ontario and Quebec). Although domestic demand is limited (prescription drugs constitute the main opioid abuse), heroin-related emergency-room visits have risen exponentially, especially in Ontario. COVID-19 border closures have exacerbated heroin-related deaths due to market disruptions,causing a more unpredictable and toxic street supply. Cocaine imported from Latin America via the Caribbean and US is controlled by organized domestic and foreign criminal syndicates. Although cocaine is widely available in cities, and is thought to result in the highest state loss in terms of medical, security and productivity costs, consumption is low compared to countries of equivalent economic size, and the price of cocaine is higher. ","text - criminal actors":"Organized crime in Canada is dominated by over twenty mafia-style OMCGs,defined by brand names and symbols, the most prominent being Hells Angels and Outlaws. The former controls wholesale drug trafficking in various jurisdictions, and criminals pay a tax to operate in their territory. Besides the Hells Angels, OMCGs are highly localized and engage in illegal gambling, bookmaking, loan sharking, financial crimes, extortion, intimidation, drug dealing and trafficking, human trafficking, prostitution and the smuggling of weapons and cigarettes. Violence occurs periodically when gangs compete over territory. Foreign criminalactors of Latin American origin are active in Toronto and Montreal, as arethe \u2018Ndrangheta, whose complex cell structure is aligned to familial groups in Italy. The 'Ndrangheta primarily engage in money laundering, as well as drug distribution and trafficking. The 2013 death of a clan leader led to a protracted power struggle and the assassination of a several prominent figures connected to the mafia. Asian actors, includingthe Triads, are involved inloan sharking, drug trafficking, and money laundering through casinos and real estate, and Vietnamese criminal groups operate in all large Canadian metropolises. ##&& Loose criminal networks are predominantly involved in drug trafficking, contraband cigarettes, gambling, counterfeiting, fraud, smuggling and human trafficking. The human-smuggling market features both organized criminal networks and opportunistic smugglers, the latter tending to be migrants themselves. There is little evidence of state-embedded actors, butthere are increasing attempts to corrupt officers, leading to a growth in the inflow of smuggled drugs and firearms.","text - leadership and governance":"Canada is among the most stable and least corrupt countries in the world. It enjoys strong rule of law, a comprehensive legislative framework and high levels of public trust. The government's organized-crime strategy is regularly reviewed by the National Coordinating Committee (NCC), and there are well-resourced justice frameworks, social services, public-awareness campaigns, andspecial law-enforcement units partnered with federal, provincial and territorial associates. Canada has ratified most international instruments countering organized crime, including those related to arms trafficking, the asset freezing of corrupt former foreign officials and extradition (with the US). Through its mutual legal assistance agreements, Canada may legally obtain court orders on behalf of participating countries, and domestic legal provisions are in place to address corporate criminal wrongdoing. A number of public platforms, such as the 'open government' website and Employment and Social Development Canada, provide open-access information on government actions and the spending of taxpayer funds. ##&& Due to the growing number of drug overdoses, Canada has also taken steps towards decriminalizing the possession of illegal drugs for personal use. However, political rhetoric has not always translated effectively into policies and implementation. For example, a federal firearmsban,prompted by increasing gun violence, contains loopholes allowing for the continued purchase of a wide variety of semi-automatic rifles. More can also be done to address the growth of gangs in aboriginal territories, as well as the long-standing marginalization of youth. Criticisms have emerged regarding the lack of transparency in the beneficial ownership of corporations and trusts, facilitating money laundering and rising house prices, especially in British Columbia.","text - criminal justice and security":"Although there are no specialized courts exclusively dedicated to organized crime, the Canadian judiciary appears to be effective, and is considered largely free from corruption. However, cases exist in which charges were dropped by prosecutors due to procedural mistakes or police refusal to disclose investigation techniques. While Canada's Association of Chiefs of Police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP),the NCC and its Regional\/Provincial Coordinating Committees all work to address organized crime, the results of cooperation and information-sharing agreements, policies and frameworks have been modest, with significant resourcing challenges andcompetition among law enforcement despite cooperation agreements. Canada lacks adequate infrastructure to monitor cross-border activities, and only a small fraction of all illicit drugs are detected. Widespread smuggling from China is facilitated by criminal-group members and associates active at marine ports. While cocaine smuggling from Mexico via official entry points at the Canadian\u2013US border is increasing, the scale of illegal imports is limited considering the size of the border and the two countries\u2019 economies. ##&& With regard to the state-run prison system, there have been cases of improper solitary confinement, accusations of torture, serious injury and deathcaused by correctional officials. Gang alliances and violence are a growing security challenge for penitentiaries and increase the likelihood of recidivism, with aboriginal criminal groups historically overrepresented in the system.","text - economic and financial environment":"Canada has a strong economic regulatory environment, as well as criminal and civil laws. Such measures have proved effective in governing natural resources, enabling legal businesses, and in resisting money laundering, corruption and terrorist financing. Nonetheless, the annual laundering of billions of Canadian dollars through casinos, real estate and banks by foreign criminal groups is attributed in part to lax enforcement and insufficient compliance with laws mandating the reporting of large cash or suspicious transactions. Crime proceeds invested in real estate are especially problematic in British Columbia, while in Toronto and Montreal there is evidence of criminal influence in the tow-truck industry.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Canadian government has a fairly robust framework in place to support victims of modern slavery, but there appears to be a deficit in police resources for victim services,and protocols to better meet the needs of women, children, indigenous or disabled victims. Canada has a National Office for Victims, providing a single point of contact for public enquiries and complaints, and federal law formally entrenches victims\u2019 rights throughout the criminal justice system. Nevertheless, the victim\u2019s role is often limited to providing evidence and a victim-impact statement. The RCMP has full-time Witness Protection Programme units across Canada, but while there is strong federal policy in place, application could be better. Many services are free, yet it is often up to the victim to make initial contact. Restrictive restitution guidelines make it difficult for victims to receive appropriate compensation, and when courts rule in a victim\u2019s favour, acquiring retribution from the perpetrator often proves difficult. ##&& The media actively reports on issues related to organized crime in Canada, and the government is committed to the protection of civil society organizations and press freedom, both domestically and abroad. Although some advocacy groups focus on human trafficking, contraband cigarettes and drug trafficking, the state does little to encourage non-state-actor involvement in combating organized crime, except in the case of private-sector forensic accounting firms. These conduct investigations into financial crimes, either independently or on contract with law-enforcement agencies. While no national strategy focuses specifically on organized-crime prevention, public-education campaigns have been implemented to raise awareness (e.g. about consumer fraud and contraband cigarettes),and border communities are taught to spot and report smuggling. Some provincial policies allow licensed establishment owners to remove suspected gang members, but few communities actively combat organized crime.","Number of pages":"3","Capital":"Ottawa","GDP (current $US million)":"1736425.63","Income group":"High income","Population":"37593384","Land Area (sq. km)":"9879750","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"21.7","Freedom in the World Index":"98","Human Development Index":"0.93","Global Peace Index":"1.30","Democracy Index":"9.24","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"77","GDP per capita (current US$)":"46190","1":"3.67","1.1":"3.45","1.2":"3.88","2":"7.25"},{"Corresp":"35","ISO-3":"CHL","Country":"Chile","ISO-2":"CL","Continent":"Americas","Region":"South America","Flag file":"cl.png","1.

Importantly, the routes and modalities used in illicit drug imports to Chile have been linked to arms trafficking. There are also indications of corruption, increases in crimes committed with firearms and groups selling arms from prisons. Law enforcement has been involved in the illicit selling of arms, sometimes reporting firearms as lost and then selling them to drug traffickers. The increase in demand for arms is directly related to an increase in the drug market and evident in an escalation of gun-related homicide rates in the country. Of the millions of licit and illicit arms in circulation, only a small number are registered with the General Office of National Mobilization. Even then, people with no criminal records are often paid by criminals to register arms and then report them lost or stolen.

Perhaps more significantly, Chile is a source and destination country for the illicit trade in exotic fauna such as birds, monkeys and reptiles. A clandestine market operates where large sums are paid for exotic species, used locally as mascots or for their fur. It is likely that perpetrators are small criminal organizations with connections to source countries, mainly Brazil and Bolivia.

The market involves criminal organizations with ties to foreign actors, prisons and clients. Furthermore, increasing violence related to the drug market is evident in shootings and homicides between local rival organizations. Arguably, drugs and arms are imported into the country in the same way. ##&& Chile is a major cannabis consumer in Latin America, and cannabis produced in the country mainly feeds domestic demand. Paraguay is the main cannabis distributor in the Americas, but Colombian 'creepy' cannabis, known for its high levels of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is also sold to upper and middle-class markets, Chile included. Cannabis is transported in part by small, primarily Colombian, criminal networks, and reportedly some cannabis shipments cross through Chile to Argentina. Meanwhile, Ecstasy and phenethylamine are the most imported synthetic substances. Synthetic drug imports originate in the Netherlands, Germany and Spain, as well as in Argentina and Colombia. Chile is also a transit country for synthetic drugs from Colombia. The market targets young adults, but the consumer base has expanded to encompass diverse socio-economic groups. Most seizures are associated with individual possession, but some cases of criminal organization involvement have been identified as well. Notably, synthetic drugs have been seized in prisons. The most common modus operandi for entry has been the delivery of the synthetics into Chile via Santiago\u2019s Arturo Merino Benitez Airport. ","text - criminal actors":"Organized crime in Chile is largely characterized by loose criminal networks, mostly anonymous family clans, operating in marginalized neighbourhoods and involved in drug trafficking, contraband, human smuggling and trafficking. These networks are mostly territorial, use low levels of violence and coordinate their operations with foreign actors. Although the government claims these groups might play a role in ongoing protests, there is no evidence of them attempting to influence the democratic process. Mafia-style groups operating in Chile also include drug trafficking family networks and family clans with defined leadership, small to moderate membership and low levels of territorial control. However, some operate transnationally, coordinating arms, drug and contraband trafficking with foreign actors. Additionally, drug trafficking groups use prisoners to carry out operations. ##&& There are many reports of corruption, particularly at Chile\u2019s borders, which directly or indirectly facilitates criminal markets such as contraband, drug trafficking and human smuggling through protection or lack of control. State officials have also been accused of involvement in arms and drug trafficking locally. Significantly, military equipment has been reported lost and allegedly transferred to criminal groups. Foreign actors, Colombian organizations in particular, are engaged in the illegal cannabis market in Chile. Besides local criminal actors collaborating with foreign groups, nationals from countries with strong historical migration flows into Chile have also allegedly been involved in human trafficking.","text - leadership and governance":"While stable, Chile\u2019s stability was challenged in 2019 following mass national protests and subsequent human rights violations, including injuries and murder, perpetrated by the national police. After months of conflict, Chileans voted by referendum for the Constitution to be rewritten. Punitive measures are being implemented to combat organized crime, including the deployment of the army to fight drug trafficking and contraband. In addition, President Sebastian Pi\u00f1era announced a plan to incorporate open government measures, anti-bribery and corruption measures, open data, smart government, public probity, and transparency through legislative and administrative measures. Anti-corruption institutions outside the government also proposed a similar agenda. However, the Pi\u00f1era administration has been less transparent in investigating and prosecuting security officials responsible for the human rights violations against peaceful demonstrators. Furthermore, authorities have uncovered one of the largest corruption operations in the Chilean police's history, in which officers ran a scam to increase their salaries. Nonetheless, corruption levels are perceived as fairly low in the country. ##&& Chile has signed most international treaties pertaining to organized crime, and it has extradition agreements with eighteen countries. Chile also engages well in international cooperation on anti-organized crime, evident in a number of successful police operations and seizures. In line with Chile's commitments abroad, a number of national laws target organized crime, including human trafficking and smuggling, drug trafficking, gun control and tax evasion. However, the legal framework needs fine-tuning in respect to non-renewable resources and flora crimes, as these are only penalized if there is some form of tax evasion, while illegal logging merely elicits an administrative penalty.","text - criminal justice and security":"Chile has one of the lowest regional rates of investment in the judicial system or judges per capita, but the judiciary is considered largely independent. The Chilean prosecutor\u2019s office has a specialized unit in charge of money laundering, economic crimes, environmental crimes and organized crime. However, prisons suffer overcrowding with reports indicating inmates have insufficient access to water and hygiene services, mainly attributed to the inexistence of a criminal enforcement law, corruption and insufficient infrastructure and investment. Although high homicide levels exist inside prisons, the system is not controlled by criminal groups. ##&& Meanwhile, the main security bodies in Chile are the Carabineros de Chile, the national militarized police force managed by the interior ministry, and the Chilean investigative police (PDI), a civilian police force responsible for investigating crimes. Both have internal intelligence capacities, as do the military bodies, but Chile\u2019s primary intelligence organization is the national intelligence agency (ANI). Furthermore, the police have their own anti-drug and organized crime unit. Chile's law of intelligence allows police officers to address threats ranging from terrorism, organized crime, drug trafficking and the use of reserved funds without judicial authorization, but resulting information is inadmissible in court. The lack of information sharing between police forces, ANI and other organizations has been criticized, however, intelligence sharing with other countries appears effective. Furthermore, a joint task force between Carabineros, PDI, customs, the armed forces and the civil air control agency has been created to combat organized crime at Chile\u2019s northern border. Chile shares borders with two major cocaine producers, Peru and Bolivia, as well as Argentina, an important transit and destination country for drug trafficking. The borders present many vulnerabilities, including numerous unauthorized border crossing points. Chile also has ports of significant size, vulnerable to trafficking, and the expansion of the Panama Canal has allowed for direct transit to the ports of Valparaiso, San Antonio, San Vicente and Coronel, contributing to the increased risk of trafficking flows.","text - economic and financial environment":"Chilean law encompasses terrorism financing and money laundering, and, importantly, cases have been successfully prosecuted under the legislation. The prosecutor\u2019s office is responsible for investigating and bringing money-laundering cases to justice, while the financial analysis unit prevents and detects suspicious activity. In recent years, more crimes have been incorporated as part of anti-money laundering efforts, including the embezzlement of public funds, fraud against the treasury, fraud, contraband and illicit arms trafficking. ##&& The economic regulatory environment is moderately conducive to doing business, and the private sector plays an important role in the economy. Previously, the state launched a programme to promote small, micro and medium enterprises and improve access to international markets. Nevertheless, a bureaucratic and regulatory system makes it difficult for businesses to operate, with tax payments made more costly due to an increase in corporate income tax. However, starting a business has been made easier through online registration of closed corporations, and establishing an electronic platform that allows plaintiffs to file initial complaints online. Additionally, the country's secured transactions system has been improved through a unified collateral registry and a new legal framework for nonpossessory security interests, requiring more corporate disclosure and managing the approval of transactions between interested parties.","text - civil society and social protection":"Chile's Victims Support Programme assists victims of human smuggling and trafficking with centres in every region, while underage victims and witnesses can testify via pre-recorded interviews. The prosecutor\u2019s office has a victim and witness attention section to provide support and protection to those going through a penal process, and the National Crime Victims Policy focuses on victim participation in decision-making, restorative justice, improvement of investigative systems, access to case information and state compensation. Overall, the government has a fairly robust framework to provide support to victims of modern slavery. The National Service for the Prevention and Rehabilitation of Drug and Alcohol Consumption is in charge of implementing drug and alcohol prevention and rehabilitation programmes, and the Subsecretar\u00eda de Prevenci\u00f3n del Delito runs other programmes in vulnerable territories. The government also created a civil society council to promote civil society participation in the elaboration of drug prevention and rehabilitation policies, plans and programmes, and a National Agreement for Public Safety was launched in 2019, focusing on police reform, including non-state actor participation. Additionally, the PDI has created an environment brigade to promote prevention action against fauna and flora crimes. Chile\u2019s poverty reduction efforts are more effective than in other countries in the region, but the country is considered one of the most unequal in the developed world. ##&& Chile has made efforts to promote press freedom, and coverage of police violence during political protests has been substantial. Although NGOs and opposition leaders frequently contribute to electronic media, concentrated media ownership and a lack of resources are continual challenges. The confidentiality of journalists\u2019 sources is sometimes violated, and certain issues, such as political corruption and protests by the indigenous Mapuche communities, are taboo for journalists.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Santiago","GDP (current $US million)":"282318.16","Income group":"High income","Population":"18952038","Land Area (sq. km)":"756700","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"44.1","Freedom in the World Index":"93","Human Development Index":"0.85","Global Peace Index":"1.80","Democracy Index":"8.28","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"67","GDP per capita (current US$)":"14896","1":"4.60","1.1":"4.45","1.2":"4.75","2":"6.42"},{"Corresp":"37","ISO-3":"COL","Country":"Colombia","ISO-2":"CO","Continent":"Americas","Region":"South America","Flag file":"co.png","1.

While networks mainly traffic women to Asia for sexual exploitation, there are other routes that lead to the Caribbean. With prostitution legalized in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia has domestic networks feeding people into the capital from around the country. Colombia also has a prolific online human-trafficking industry, mainly catering to foreign visitors. ##&& Colombia is a vital transit country for migrants moving across the region, mainly heading for the US. Multiple criminal actors \u2013 from international organizations to local criminal structures and specialized networks \u2013 smuggle African, Asian, Haitian and Cuban nationals through the country. The crisis in Venezuela has swelled the demand and profits for smugglers, with that country essentially becoming a hub for human smuggling to which Colombian networks have easy access, moving people north to the US or south to the Southern Cone countries. COVID-19 has had a major short-term impact on human smuggling, owing to the restrictions placed on transport and travel. It remains too early to be clear, however, on the longer-term impacts the COVID-19 pandemic will have on human smuggling in Colombia. ","text - trade":"Colombia\u2019s illicit arms market is large as a result of the number of groups in its criminal world vying for arms, such as guerrilla armies, pro-government paramilitaries and several loose criminal networks. Alongside these groups, Colombia has its own insurgent army, the Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n (ELN), which is armed by the illegal import of weapons with the assistance of international criminal networks. The economic collapse in Venezuela is having an impact in this market in Colombia, with growing volumes of arms being diverted from the Venezuelan army into the hands of Colombian criminal actors. Despite arms trafficking declining to some extent since the 1990s and 2000s due to the demobilization of certain paramilitary groups, the market remains large and highly active.","text - environment":"Flora crimes are increasingly widespread in Colombia and, although this illicit market is not a major one for the country\u2019s most prominent organized-crime groups, some of the more sophisticated criminal groups are becoming involved in extortion practices within the flora market. Approximately half of Colombia\u2019s wood production is considered to be illegal and, since the demobilization of the FARC guerrilla group, vast areas of virgin forest have opened up, creating opportunities for criminal exploitation. Similarly, the illegal wildlife market is a pressing issue and Colombia has become a significant source country for trafficking of illegal animal products, such as exotic birds and reptiles, destined primarily for Europe. There are also illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing practices off Colombia\u2019s Pacific and Archipelago coasts. ##&& The most pervasive environmental crime in the country, however, is illicit trade in non-renewable resources. Colombia is the fourth-largest gold producer in the continent, and with 80% of gold thought to be extracted illegally, this is by far the most common and lucrative illicit trade in non-renewable resources. Illegally mined gold can be readily legalized in Colombia, making the country a hub for laundering narco-profits and a destination country for conflict gold from Venezuela. Gold mining is linked to corruption and high levels of violence, and it is anticipated that a shift from illicit crop cultivation to illegal gold mining is likely to occur because of its profitability and weakening environmental control as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, petrol smuggling has been known to occur and although the country\u2019s emerald trade has become increasingly regulated, it has historically been a bastion of criminal groups and used for money laundering. ","text - drugs":"Cocaine production and trafficking are the main criminal markets in Colombia, with the country producing 75% of the world\u2019s cocaine. Colombia traffics cocaine to North America, Europe and Asia through transit points in Africa, the Middle East and South-eastern Asia. Sophisticated local criminal networks are linked to international organized crime groups that traffic the drug across porous borders. Various eradication efforts to reduce the number of hectares under coca cultivation have been unsuccessful, and the amount of cocaine produced has continued to grow each year. Brazil, historically a transit route for Colombian cocaine, has now become one of the largest consumer markets for cocaine in the world and a significant destination market for Colombia. Cocaine is a major source of funding for criminal groups and one of the main causes of conflict and murder. Furthermore, domestic consumption of cocaine has increased in Colombia. ##&& Colombia is also a source and destination market for cannabis, likely the second-largest drug-trafficking market after cocaine and the most consumed drug domestically. The main cultivation area for cannabis is a current centre of violence as ex-FARC members battle other groups for control of the industry. The heroin trade is also a significant source of income for domestic trafficking organizations. The trade is run by groups, often operating out of Cali, that supply the high-end market in the US. There is also a sizeable heroin market in the country, with poppy cultivation in Nari\u00f1o and Cauca, managed by criminal groups, which continues to be a significant source of income for local communities. Lastly, there appears to be a small-scale synthetic drug production market in Colombia, and there is growing consumption linked to the nightclub scene.","text - criminal actors":"There are numerous sophisticated and powerful mafia-style groups in Colombia, including the ex-FARC mafia and the ELN. Colombia\u2019s main cultivation and departure points for illegal drugs and many of the informal mining areas are largely under the control of these powerful organized-criminal groups. They comprise thousands of individuals and are involved not only in transnational organized crime, but also in low-level activities such as extortion. They exert social control and illicit governance in certain areas, imposing norms, regulating civilian activity, and providing social services in lieu of the state. ##&& Colombia\u2019s organized-crime networks are well structured, though it is likely that there has been some fragmentation in recent decades. They have proven very adaptable in diversifying their methods to suit evolving transnational crime conditions and work in smaller and more informal networks. These groups appear to have stronger levels of influence and impact in modern-day Colombia. As the cocaine trade has fragmented, more criminal networks have entered the industry to gather parts of the trade. However, they also operate in most other illicit economies, including arms trafficking, environmental crimes and the trafficking and smuggling of people. ##&& Although corruption in Colombia is of a lower level and less systemic than seen in its Latin American neighbours, it is still endemic in all state branches and levels of government. For example, politicians often form alliances with criminal actors in an attempt to win elections, later returning favours by embezzling state funds to such actors. Criminal groups regularly bribe judges and attorneys, including those operating in the country\u2019s high courts. Police, military and prison officials are also frequently embroiled in corruption scandals. ##&& There is no evidence of armed, organized foreign groups having a presence in Colombia. However, there are a plethora of foreign emissaries from drug-trafficking groups involved in the processing and transport of drugs. There has also been an increase in members of European mafia groups collaborating with Colombian actors in the cocaine trade, and a notable increase in Mexican actors. However, the evidence points to Mexican cartels serving in emissary roles within Colombia, rather than seeking to establish territorial control or solidify their presence in the country. Finally, Brazil\u2019s powerful prison gangs also maintain an operational presence within Colombia. ","text - leadership and governance":"The Colombian government has taken a tough stance against organized crime, with a particularly hard line against drug trafficking focusing on forced eradication of drug crops. Although significant work remains to be done, the government has been successful, at the municipal and national level, in scaling back organized-criminal groups\u2019 power and potential for violence and disruption. While far from perfect, Colombia is a leader among Latin American countries for transparency and accountability. The state has several tools in place to publish and provide transparency in government, although not all branches of government are equally accessible. Widespread corruption, however, still greatly undermines and hinders the transparency of state bodies, and public trust in institutions suffers as a result. ##&& While Colombia has ratified many of the relevant international treaties, it has notably not ratified protocols around the smuggling of migrants and firearms trafficking, and is not a member of the Arms Trade Treaty. Colombia has a cooperative relationship with the US, using billions of dollars of American money to fight drug trafficking and organized crime; it continues to extradite prominent criminal figures to the US. Colombia also cooperates with the EU, as well as other Latin American countries in crime-related initiatives. ##&& Colombia has a reasonably solid legislative framework for identifying and combating organized crime, and primary legislation pertaining to drugs and firearms. In 2019, Colombia adopted a national strategy on human smuggling, with assistance provided by the UNODC. There are also laws on human trafficking and exploitation, although the definition of trafficking falls short of international legal standards.","text - criminal justice and security":"Although there are various independent mechanisms in place to regulate the judicial system, it is burdened by a lack of resources and high levels of corruption, with exceedingly high impunity rates. Overall, the Colombian prison agency is well organized compared to its neighbouring countries, and, although organized-criminal groups \u2013 especially prominent mafia figures from Medell\u00edn \u2013 continue to organize their networks from prison, the state maintains control over the prison system. ##&& Colombia is well equipped to fight organized crime: it has the second-largest armed force in the Americas, as well as numerous intelligence bodies and special units focused on organized crime. However, the country\u2019s vast and difficult terrain means criminal groups have consolidated control in areas that security forces struggle to reach. Moreover, communication between intelligence agencies and judicial bodies is sometimes poor, and widespread corruption continues to be one of the greatest obstacles to effective law enforcement. Police reform has become a major political issue in the country, in response to police killings of civilians. ##&& Colombia\u2019s porous international borders, with large areas populated by rainforest, create a strategic weakness for the government, enabling criminal groups to move large volumes of illegal commodities in and out of the country under cover. The geography of the country has also made establishing the effective presence of law-enforcement bodies difficult in remote areas, where criminal groups have managed to exert social, economic and political control. ","text - economic and financial environment":"Colombia has among the highest levels of money laundering and terrorist financing in the world. Although the country has had some success in investigating and prosecuting money-laundering activities, the problem is so pervasive that it overwhelms the efforts of the state. Colombia has a specialized anti-money-laundering unit (the financial investigations and analysis unit), which works with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to detect suspicious financial movements. However, money-laundering practices are sophisticated and diverse, making them difficult to detect. ##&& Colombia has relatively good economic regulation systems under its state entities and national bank, although there have been reports that national and foreign corporations were forced to pay paramilitary groups for security against insurgent threats. The main area of weakness lies in the difficulty in accessing the financial system, especially in rural areas, creating ideal conditions for criminal groups to step in to provide financial services, and effectively launder dirty money. Extortion practices and protection payments are rife in these areas and land property rights remain a significant issue, negatively impacting vulnerable populations. ","text - civil society and social protection":"Although Colombia has laws in place aimed at supporting the victims of armed conflict, the processes of victim reparation run by the state are often poorly implemented, involving delays and shortcomings. The lack of witness protection schemes is also a serious concern, while Colombia falls well below international standards on helping victims exit slavery. The treatment of human trafficking victims and drug-abuse victims is another area where support is severely lacking. ##&& The Colombian government has largely taken a militarized approach to combating organized crime, and effective prevention measures are lacking. Programmes aimed at hindering the cultivation of drug-producing crops are losing momentum, and light-touch laws around the confiscation of personal doses of illegal drugs seem lacklustre and have been met with scepticism. However, there have been attempts to implement more experimental, non-police prevention strategies aimed at curbing criminal governance, with policy experiments, such as hotspot policing, in Bogot\u00e1 and Cali. Although these have not led to substantive changes in policy, they indicate an appetite for novel policy solutions and progressive leadership among mayors and civil-society groups. ##&& There is a fairly robust civil society presence in Colombia, which plays a key role in analyzing and hindering organized crime, mediating with criminal groups and helping to get vulnerable youths out of gangs. NGOs, as well as international and religious groups, and organizations linked to the private sector play an important role in the fight against organized crime. However, the scale of organized crime and the associated violence experienced by civil society actors suppresses the effectiveness of their initiatives. Although investigative journalism plays a strong role in Colombia, at the same time it is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists who cover subjects such as the environment, armed conflicts, organized crime and corruption, and they are frequently targets of abduction and assassinations.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Bogota","GDP (current $US million)":"323615.98","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"50339443","Land Area (sq. km)":"1141750","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"79.3","Freedom in the World Index":"65","Human Development Index":"0.77","Global Peace Index":"2.65","Democracy Index":"7.04","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"39","GDP per capita (current US$)":"6429","1":"7.67","1.1":"7.20","1.2":"8.13","2":"5.83"},{"Corresp":"41","ISO-3":"CRI","Country":"Costa Rica","ISO-2":"CR","Continent":"Americas","Region":"Central America","Flag file":"cr.png","1.

Thus, criminal organizations have easy access to firearms, evident in the high rates of firearm-related homicide.","text - environment":"Costa Rica is an important source country for flora and fauna crimes. Timber, namely cocobolo,is trafficked to Asia, and Asian nationals reportedly hire local intermediaries to facilitate its extraction. Due to flexible customs controls, timber is packed with teak, and subsequently approved for extraction and exportation. As a result of its biodiversity, Costa Rica is a source country for live animals and animal parts, including turtles, iguanas, snakes, frogs, cat pelts, shark fins, butterflies, beetles, wasps and spiders. There is also easy access to animal-made products, such as shell bracelets, reptile-skin wallets and bird feathers. In some cases, animals are exported by commercial shipments. Tourists have also transported live snakes, frogs, lizards, hummingbirds and coatis through the airports. Within Costa Rica, there is a black market for turtle eggs, birds, monkeys and fish, which has grown over the course of 2020 in part due the COVID-19 pandemic. The country has been a major supplierof shark fins to Hong Kong, Taiwan and some European countries, but since 2014, legal exportation has been debated. There are also reports of shark carcasses being used to traffic cocaine to Mexico, another major shark meat recipient, enabled by corruption. Market-related violence has been recorded, and anenvironmentalist was killed in 2013 while trying to protect endangered turtle eggs. Illegal gold mining and associated mercury trafficking are reportedly increasing in Costa Rica. The extraction of gold at Las Crucitas mine was handled by a foreign firm until 2011, but mining regulation changes resulted in the company's concession being revoked. In light of this, illegal miners started exploiting the remaining reserves. Illegal extraction commonly involves Nicaraguan operators, known for using rudimentary methods to expose gold with mercury. Costa Rican gold exports do not match production, and some export documents are falsified to enable gold trafficking by criminal networks, mainly to clients in the US.","text - drugs":"Costa Rica\u2019s location and vast maritime territory make it highly vulnerable to drug trafficking. Colombian cocaine is trafficked through the country to the US and Europe, by sea, air and land routes. Numerous international trafficking rings use both the Port of Lim\u00f3n on the Atlantic coast, as well as ports on the Pacific coast. Initially, Costa Rican criminal structures mainly guarded drug shipments and were paid with drugs, but domestic groups now run trafficking operations. As a result, an increase in local consumption has been observed. Still, small local networks help transport and store the drugs, while certain Costa Rican groups often control different dealing spots throughout the country. Significantly, former security and police officials have been arrested for leading and facilitating drug trafficking networks. Similar to other Latin American states, Costa Rica has seen an increase in homicide rates related to drug trafficking. The cannabis market is sourced from domestic plants, mainly grown in mountainous indigenous areas, and by imports, known as High Red, from Jamaica. The latter primarily enters the country by boats passing through Colombia\u2019s San Andres and Providencia archipelago. Costa Rican cannabis is of low quality and unlikely to be exported. Smaller cannabis seizures usually occur in the province of San Jos\u00e9, with the largest occurring in Lim\u00f3n. ##&& While there is no significant market for heroin, Costa Rica is a destination market for small amounts of synthetic drugs imported from Asia and the US. Synthetic drug use is increasing, and the most commonly seized drugs are Ecstasy, LSD and K2, with ketamine also becoming increasingly popular.","text - criminal actors":"Los Moreco is a well-structured mafia-style group involved in drug trafficking across the country, mainly in the provinces of Lim\u00f3n, Alajuela, Guanacaste and San Jos\u00e9.

In addition, a fishmonger in Lim\u00f3n is allegedly a leading drug trafficking figure, aided by his political connections and stance against violence. Other groups, however, use violence, with Los Moreco found in possession of AR15 rifles, grenades and ammunition. Loose criminal networks engage in drug dealing, human trafficking as well as environmental crime and contraband. Some of these loose structures also facilitate cocaine transportation, while others invest drug money in loan shark schemes. They tend to be widespread across the country with links to Colombia and Mexico. ##&& State-embedded actors do not appear to engage directly in organized crime in Costa Rica. Although assessed as less corrupt than counterparts in the region, there have been indications of ties of law enforcement officers to organized crime. Transnational criminal groups are known to work closely with local groups to traffic cocaine, cannabis and arms. The main groups are Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa Cartel, the Italian \u2018Ndrangheta and members of the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. Additionally, drug traffickers from other Central American countries, such as the Honduran Atlantic Cartel, have set up base in Costa Rica and used it as a hideout.","text - leadership and governance":"Carlos Alvarado Quesada was elected president in 2018 on an anti-corruption and organized crime platform, but aside from proposals to strengthen the national police, and to restrict gun control, details around his campaign were vague.

The minister of public security also announced the strengthening of border police cooperation with Panama through the Latin American Police Cooperation Centre. Additionally, authorities promised to use a sizeable donation from China to purchase telecommunications and protection equipment for public force officers. The government is perceived as fairly transparent and the country is among the more stable in the world. Costa Rica also appears to have a strong legal and institutional framework against corruption, including an office established in 1948 to fight public service corruption and to promote ethics and transparency. In response to an increase in corruption cases, the judicial investigations agency(OIJ) established an anti-corruption office. Furthermore, Costa Rica has made efforts to combat corruption and bribery as part of a drive to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. ##&& Costa Rica has signed and ratified a number of international instruments related to organized crime, drug and arms trafficking and environmental protection.

A system approved by the legislative assembly to block outgoing calls from prisons has yet to be installed because of COVID-19 movement restrictions. ##&& The office of the public prosecutor determines the scope of investigations and the OIJ is responsible for criminal investigations. The OIJ and the national police are Costa Rica\u2019s main security agencies, as the country has no military. INTERPOL\u2019s National Central Bureau, part of the OIJ, and based in San Jos\u00e9,is the main point of contact for foreign agencies collaborating with Costa Rican authorities. Additionally, the national police have a number of special units in charge of anti-narcotics operations, and although generally trusted, there have been cases of police involvement in drug trafficking. The borders, patrolled by the police border unit, are most affected by drug, arms and human trafficking as well as illegal mining and human smuggling. The air surveillance service has increased its capacity to control the country's airspace with additional radars and training, while the government expanded the use of the JWIP, resulting in more convictions for trafficking. Costa Rica is also a participant of the WCO Container Control Programme and collaborates with Panama and Nicaragua on border control strategies. In response to COVID-19, Costa Rica imposed restrictions on all foreign nationals entering the country, and enhanced police border presence. However, the border length and blind spots render effective border control difficult.","text - economic and financial environment":"Costa Rica remains an important money-laundering hub, despite its money laundering laws, a technical commission for implementing and monitoring the national strategy and mechanisms to freeze terrorist funds and to train judges, prosecutors and judicial investigators. Money is primarily laundered through the construction industry, financial institutions, casinos and currency exchange houses. In addition, a recent increase in money laundering activities is attributed to the drug trade. There are concerns regarding authorities\u2019 capacity to halt drug trafficking syndicates from further infiltrating the legal economy. ##&& Nonetheless, Costa Rica\u2019s economic environment is favourable for legal businesses, despite rising operating costs, a challenging legal environment and infrastructure deficiencies. Foreign direct investment is high, and it has been a significant economic growth contributor. Historically, international drug trade organizations have used Costa Rican citizens to facilitate the laundering of criminal proceeds via banks as well as other legitimate businesses in the country. However, a private American business initiative, the Business Alliance for Secure Commerce, has been established to promote safer international trade. Not least of all, loan sharking and other extortion-related practices have reportedly been on the rise in Costa Rica, with private persons as well as both legal and illegal businesses affected by them.","text - civil society and social protection":"The two support mechanisms for victims and witnesses of crime are the victim and witness protection unit of the OIJ and the office of attention for crime victims of the public prosecution service. The latter also provides free and confidential protection to crime victims, as well as individual and group psychological care, social assistance, legal advice and referrals to social support networks and health care institutions. Costa Rica also has three main prevention programmes under the ministry of public security: a community security programme, a commercial security programme and a programme focused on the protection of children and adolescents. Most efforts to tackle organized crime are in collaboration with foreign governments or international organizations. Additionally, the Foundation for Peace and Democracy has been implementing a project to improve police capacity to prevent youth violence and criminal activity. Despite extremely high levels of media freedom, media ownership is concentrated in the hands of a limited number of people, limiting pluralism and diversity in the media landscape. Nevertheless, several international and private academic, advocacy and research institutes investigate security and organized crime related trends and issues.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"San Jose","GDP (current $US million)":"61801.39","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"5047561","Land Area (sq. km)":"51100","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"42.5","Freedom in the World Index":"91","Human Development Index":"0.81","Global Peace Index":"1.69","Democracy Index":"8.16","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"57","GDP per capita (current US$)":"12244","1":"4.99","1.1":"4.85","1.2":"5.13","2":"5.50"},{"Corresp":"44","ISO-3":"CUB","Country":"Cuba","ISO-2":"CU","Continent":"Americas","Region":"Caribbean","Flag file":"cu.png","1.

Additionally, sex tourism is common in the country and Cuba, along with Jamaica, Barbados and the Dominican Republic, is a popular Caribbean destination for sex tourism. While prostitution is legal and widespread, there are reports of workers experiencing trafficking-like situations. Furthermore, Cuba\u2019s international medical mission programme, M\u00e1s M\u00e9dicos, is often accused of constituting a form of human trafficking as deployed medical practitioners experience coercion and confiscation of both pay and identity documents. ##&& Like human trafficking, human smuggling is an important criminal market in Cuba, as it is a source country for people trying to reach the US using two main routes \u2013 the Straits of Florida or overland through Central America. Local organizations aid the crossing via the Straits of Florida, supplying irregular migrants with homemade rafts. Irregular migrants can also fly from Cuba to a Latin American country before crossing into the US, in which case the land journey is facilitated by international smuggling rings.","text - trade":"While the illicit arms market in Cuba is small, there is evidence of internal demand fuelled by street gangs. Moreover, the Cuban state has helped stimulate global and regional illicit arms trade through its efforts in support of Bolivarian colectivos in Venezuela. Cuban arms shipments destined for North Korea have also been detained in Panama.","text - environment":"Cuba is not a major hub for environmental criminal markets, but environmental crimes are known to occur. Non-renewable resource crime is perhaps the largest domestically generated criminal market in the country. The island suffers a significant deficit in oil supply and has a tight fuel-rationing regime. This has given rise to a local black market in diverted gasoline and fuel. State workers or thieves often divert fuel from facilities or tanker trucks, while law enforcement officers allegedly collaborate with robbers by allowing them entrance into state facilities in exchange for bribes. Members of the Cuban military have been implicated in fuel theft and the selling of diverted gasoline on the black market as well. There is also evidence of artisanal mining and illegal trade in gold and mercury, but little is known about the nature of these criminal markets. Illegal captive wildlife activities are common throughout Cuba and constitute the basis for the country\u2019s criminal fauna market. Exotic birds such as parrots and birds of prey, Gundlach\u2019s hawk and Cuban black hawks, are sold by illegal breeders as pets in the local markets, while crocodiles and hawksbill sea turtles are sold as bushmeat. The market appears to be driven mainly by independent actors rather than criminal networks. However, there is an organized trafficking network responsible in part for the illegal trafficking of Cuban painted snails. Some of the demand that drives the fauna market in Cuba is domestic, but there are reports that wildlife is trafficked to the US and Europe too. The criminal market for flora, meanwhile, seems relatively small and mostly relates to illegal logging. Reports have confirmed that state-licensed carpenters use most of Cuba\u2019s illegally harvested wood.","text - drugs":"Cuba is predominantly a destination market for cannabis and cocaine as well as, to a limited extent, a transit country for cannabis. The criminal markets for heroin and synthetic drugs are negligible in size. Cannabis is the most consumed and trafficked drug in Cuba, with demand coming primarily from visiting tourists and to a lesser extent from Cuban nationals. Cuba is also a transit country for cannabis trafficked through the Caribbean, though it is not central to the regional trade in any way. Cannabis is predominantly supplied from abroad, but domestic production exists. Actors involved in the cannabis trade include local farmers, international cartels and state embedded actors who deal in seized cannabis. Cocaine is the second most-consumed drug in Cuba. As with cannabis, tourists generate most of the demand, as the drug is generally too expensive for Cubans. Cocaine enters Cuba through maritime routes and is often transported by speedboats. Most shipments are organized and financed by Cubans living abroad. However, corrupt elements of Cuba\u2019s law enforcement are believed to allow the trade and may even facilitate it. ##&& The criminal market for heroin in Cuba is small and, again, demand is generated by tourists. Reports indicate that heroin is more expensive in Cuba than in most other countries, which puts it out of the price range for locals. The synthetic drug trade in Cuba is minimal, but there is a critical lack of knowledge of the nature and extent of consumption of this type of drug. There is, however, some evidence of consumption of stolen medicines, which, in many cases, are psychotropic drugs such as methylphenidate.","text - criminal actors":"The most powerful actors in Cuba\u2019s organized crime landscape appear to be state-embedded actors. Inefficiencies and supply shortages have created the foundation for several black markets in the country, which in turn have led to endemic illegality underpinning large parts of the economy. Military, intelligence, and law-enforcement personnel are heavily involved in these markets and control substantial parts of them. Additionally, state-embedded actors participate in currency manipulation, operate or control businesses, participate in grey-market activities, and use their enterprises for illicit enrichment or money laundering. While many more organized mafia-style groups may be quick to disintegrate, there is evidence that some gangs operate on a somewhat sustained basis. These are particularly involved in sexual exploitation and prostitution, especially of men. The most famous is Sangre por Dolor, a group that operates mainly in parts of Havana where male prostitution is visible, and in Santiago de Cuba. ##&& More loosely organized youth gangs are usually concentrated in the main cities like Havana and Santiago de Cuba, although they are also present in the eastern province of Granma and the south-eastern province of Guant\u00e1namo. Cuba is not an attractive market for foreign criminal groups due to its poor economic situation and the strict economic control exercised by the state. There have been cases in which Cuban citizens living abroad have taken part in drug trafficking with the complicity of locals, but the low number of cases shows that interaction is minimal.","text - leadership and governance":"Cuba is an authoritarian one-party state with severely restricted space for independent political organization. And the government's stance on organized crime has not been clear. On the one hand, crime is severely punished in Cuba, but black-market activity compensating for the state\u2019s inefficient provision of public goods is tolerated. Despite Cuba fares better than many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean in terms of perceived levels of corruption, both petty and grand corruption are major issues. Governance in Cuba does not meet basic standards of transparency and accountability, and the institutional framework to combat corruption does not operate independently of executive influence. Consequently, officials can engage in corruption with high levels of impunity. ##&& Cuba is party to most international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. The country has also signed extradition treaties with eleven countries. Cuba does not appear to be obstructive to international cooperation against organized crime and has successfully cooperated with the US against drug trafficking in the Caribbean. Nevertheless, the government has been strongly criticized for its foreign policy, which has contributed to arms proliferation in Latin America and for being obstructive in letting independent NGOs evaluate its human rights situation. Cuba has a number of laws aimed at tackling the various criminal markets in the country, which are largely fit for purpose. Implementation, however, is not always guaranteed, and the judicial system suffers a number of systemic issues that weaken the rule of law.","text - criminal justice and security":"The Cuban legal system does not guarantee due process and adherence to human rights principles. While the right to a fair trial is codified in the Constitution, it is often undermined by the judiciary's lack of independence. The political opposition is often unfairly prosecuted, and citizens are not protected against arbitrary arrests. Cuban prisons are among the most overcrowded in Latin America and reports of torture and ill-treatment are widespread. Cuba\u2019s police and military have often been regarded as relatively efficient in cracking down on some forms of transnational organized crime. The committees for the defence of the revolution \u2013 a network of neighbourhood associations for surveillance \u2013 have long been a key instrument in tackling groups of criminals before they mature into gangs. Nevertheless, critics often argue that this efficiency has come at the expense of basic rights and that low levels of crime in Cuba have little to do with the actual efficiency of law enforcement. Although smuggling activities persist in the country, the territorial integrity is very well established.","text - economic and financial environment":"The Cuban economy is centrally planned by the state. The state owns and operates all significant enterprises and the military heavily influences Cuba\u2019s most dynamic sectors. This economic system allows for little private sector development or entrepreneurship and limits legitimate economic opportunities. The centrally planned economy and the tight rationing regime have failed to provide necessary goods and income to many Cuban households. This, in turn, has produced a significant black market economy. Participation in this economy is widespread and considered a socially acceptable coping mechanism. ##&& Cuba has legislation regulating all aspects of money laundering but has failed to control financial institutions that service transactions related to proceeds from international drug trafficking. State-sponsored currency manipulation and money laundering have been core components of getting around financial sanctions, and as a result, Cuba has numerous strategic deficiencies in its legal anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism framework.","text - civil society and social protection":"Few mechanisms for victim protection can be identified, and Cuba generally lacks comprehensive support mechanisms for witnesses and victims of crimes such as human trafficking. On the other hand, a medical programme for the rehabilitation on people struggling with drug abuse is available. The Cuban state\u2019s approach to crime prevention is universal access to education, culture and sport. There is a strong drug prevention system in place, which was assessed to comply with international norms, along with a national healthcare system that increasingly focuses on harm reduction. Awareness of anti-social conduct is raised in children from an early age in the primary-school system. At the same time, however, the harsh nature of punishment for even minor offences has served as a deterrence mechanism. Moreover, the committees for the defence of the revolution have long been key instruments in tackling groups of criminals before they become gangs. ##&& Although the country\u2019s ongoing managed transition has given space to an emerging civil society, most tolerated civil society organizations are subordinate to the state and its ideology. Independent organizations that engage in controversial topics such as human rights, are often subject to persecution. The Cuban constitution guarantees freedom of expression but the state has little tolerance of criticism. State security persecutes journalists to such an extent that, in terms of media freedom, Cuba is considered one of the most restrictive countries in the world.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Havana","GDP (current $US million)":"100023.00","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"11333483","Land Area (sq. km)":"109880","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"59.5","Freedom in the World Index":"13","Human Development Index":"0.78","Global Peace Index":"2.07","Democracy Index":"2.84","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"47","GDP per capita (current US$)":"8822","1":"3.44","1.1":"4.00","1.2":"2.88","2":"5.38"},{"Corresp":"49","ISO-3":"DMA","Country":"Dominica","ISO-2":"DM","Continent":"Americas","Region":"Caribbean","Flag file":"dm.png","1.

The town of Portsmouth in Dominica is a potential point of departure, with some residents reporting that Haitians have been lured there with false promises of easy access to the US. ##&& Dominica is also a transit country for human smuggling, but the criminal market remains small and cases are sporadic. It is also a potential stepping-stone for Haitians going to neighbouring Martinique, Guadeloupe or the US.","text - trade":"The criminal market for arms trafficking in Dominica is believed to be sizeable.

Dominica is a transit country for both destined for other Caribbean islands, North America or Europe. Typically, Venezuelan boats will enter Dominican territory and transfer cocaine to local fishing vessels which bring it into Dominica. After being stored on the island for a short period, Dominicans facilitate the drugs\u2019 journey towards more lucrative markets such as Guadeloupe and Martinique. As with cocaine, Dominica is primarily a transit and temporary storage location for cannabis intended for other countries in the region. Additionally, Dominica is a minor cannabis producer with cultivation occurring in isolated mountainous regions. Most of the marijuana produced is consumed domestically, and evidence suggests that cannabis is by far the most prevalent drug in the country. ##&& Seizures of synthetic drugs are minimal, suggesting that the market is negligible. There is no evidence of heroin consumption or trafficking on the island.","text - criminal actors":"While there are no mafia-style groups operating in the country, there are a number of minor domestic gangs in Dominica. Typically engaging in the local drug trade, petty crime and feuds over territory, these groups have a moderately small membership and do not appear highly organized. Transnational criminal actors do not have a large-scale presence in Dominica but have formed relationships with locals. Most importantly, cocaine traffickers from Venezuela have some capacity to oversee cocaine shipments, but generally maintain a low profile and avoid attention from law enforcement.","text - leadership and governance":"Dominica is a consolidated parliamentary democracy, characterized by good and accountable governance, respect for political liberties and human rights. Political leaders in Dominica have not prioritized the fight against transnational organized crime but have nonetheless spoken out on the issue. While the Dominican government generally implements anti-corruption laws effectively, perceived levels of corruption are modest with a number of high-profile corruption cases reported, indicating some serious flaws in the country\u2019s integrity framework. The country\u2019s citizenship-for-investment, or so-called golden passport scheme, in particular, has raised the country\u2019s corruption risk. ##&& Dominica has ratified most of the relevant international treaties and conventions for organized crime, including the UNTOC, its three supplementing protocols and two inter-American conventions on mutual assistance against the arms trade. Dominica is generally committed to international cooperation in the fight against organized crime. It has legal provisions that enable extradition for drug trafficking and money laundering offences and promotes the exchange of best practices with regard to the implementation of national drug policies. It also participates in regional coordination activities to combat transnational organized crime, cooperates with third countries, particularly the UK, France and others within the EU, on combating narcotics trafficking and participates in various intelligence forums. Nevertheless, cooperation, particularly around information exchange, with other members of the Organization of American States could be strengthened. The national legislation of Dominica focuses primarily on drug trafficking, but has a number of gaps when it comes to other criminal markets such as human trafficking and human smuggling.","text - criminal justice and security":"Dominica\u2019s judiciary is independent and generally guarantees a fair trial. However, courts often suffer under-resourcing and understaffing, and consequently case backlogs occur. Dominica\u2019s Stock Farm Prison generally lives up to international standards with no reports of major abuse in the facility. There is no evidence that criminal actors in prison control illicit activity either within the prison or on the outside. Dominica\u2019s law enforcement agencies generally operate professionally, and reports of abuse or corruption are uncommon. Police and specialized units have responded well to the growing threat of cocaine trafficking on the island, but lack of staff and resources constrain the degree to which anti-trafficking efforts can be improved. Despite efforts by law enforcement to combat the use of Dominican territory by traffickers, the island\u2019s vast shoreline and maritime borders make it vulnerable to cocaine flows from South America to other Caribbean islands and to Europe.","text - economic and financial environment":"Dominica is one of the poorest countries in the eastern Caribbean. The main sources of income for locals are banana production, agriculture and tourism. The business climate is constrained by a number of factors, including judicial effectiveness and investment freedom. However, Dominica has made progress in reducing bureaucracy and the overall cost of doing business. ##&& Dominica is considered an offshore financial centre and potential money-laundering hub. The country has a high presence of anonymous offshore financial institutions with no published beneficial ownership, fraudulent investment schemes and advance-fee fraud schemes. The country\u2019s golden passport scheme may also raise the risk of dirty money finding its way into Dominica. At the same time, the country has updated and strengthened its legislative and institutional frameworks to counter money laundering, and is also active in regional asset recovery initiatives.","text - civil society and social protection":"While little is known of an actual witness or victim protection programme, funds are allocated to support police, prosecutors and victim restitution.

The phenomenon predominantly takes the form of sexual exploitation, but forced labour and marriage are also known forms of trafficking that occur in the country. Victims of human trafficking, either locals or foreign nationals transiting the Dominican Republic, are headed for a number of different potential destinations, most prominently the United States, Europe and South America. Victims from other countries may also be trafficked into the Dominican Republic where they are subjected to sexual exploitation or forced labour. Recent years have seen an influx of Venezuelan and Haitian trafficking victims, but Colombian nationals are vulnerable to exploitation in the country as well. Like their foreign counterparts, victims from the Dominican Republic are typically subjected to forced labour or sexual exploitation around the country\u2019s beach resorts. Recruitment of Dominicans is done by networks operating throughout the country under false pretences, using deceptive practices to lure victims. ##&& The criminal market for human smuggling is large, with the Dominican Republic seeing a large portion of the human-smuggling cases in the Caribbean. The Dominican Republic is a transit country for Haitians moving to South America irregularly, as well as a source country for migrants smuggled to other countries in the region, such as Chile, the United States and, particularly, nearby Puerto Rico. The high levels of human smuggling in the Dominican Republic are enabled by factors such as the country\u2019s geographic position, the crises in Haiti and Venezuela, and widespread administrative corruption in the country. Perpetrators of human smuggling into and through the Dominican Republic tend to be networks from the victims\u2019 countries, and groups from Haiti in particularly. While the use of falsified documentation is a common practice, COVID-19-related border closures and internal confinement measures have reduced migrant smuggling that relies on irregular migrants hiding within formal and mixed migration flows.","text - trade":"The Dominican Republic is a destination market for illegal small arms and light weapons. The United States plays a significant role in the arms market in the Dominican Republic, with reports suggesting that illicit arms flows originate in Florida and enter the country by sea. The porous Haitian border is another known entry point for arms into the Dominican Republic. In line with regional trends, the Dominican Republic has a high incidence of death by firearms. The country has, however, witnessed a downward trend in homicides in the recent decade. There is some evidence that military and police personnel have been involved in the criminal market for small arms and light weapons in the Dominican Republic.","text - environment":"There is a critical lack of evidence on the nature and scope of the environmental crime markets in the Dominican Republic. Nevertheless, illicit trade is known to occur in non-renewable resources such as timber and charcoal, as well as endangered species. The Dominican Republic is rich in various non-renewable resources and has a number of limestone, clay and salt mines. Notably, artisanal and unregulated mining is taking place at some sites. The Dominican Republic also plays an important role in the illicit gold trafficking market, acting as a transit country for illegal gold of Venezuelan origin. Illegal trafficking of Venezuelan gold is perpetrated by transnational criminal organizations and networks, which are simultaneously engaged in other forms of trafficking, such as drug trafficking. The main forms of flora-related crimes in the Dominican Republic are the illegal harvesting of timber and the illegal mining of charcoal. These illegal timber and charcoal products are believed to circulate regionally. Additionally, the Dominican Republic is a transit country for illegal Amazonian timber destined for Mexico and the United States, and appears to be a destination country for illegal timber originating in Peru. The Dominican Republic is rich in biodiversity and the country houses a large number of endangered species that are in demand on the black market. A large number of fauna species, in particular turtles, are sold as souvenirs for tourists and there is also a larger illicit economy in sea turtle products such as eggs, meat and shells. Another profitable commodity in the Dominican Republic is the American eel, which is in high demand in Asian countries, largely for culinary purposes.","text - drugs":"The Dominican Republic is an important trans-shipment point for cocaine, heroin, Ecstasy and fentanyl, and a destination country for cannabis. Cocaine constitutes the largest single criminal market in the Dominican Republic. The country is believed to be the leading Caribbean transit hub for cocaine from Venezuela destined for North America or Europe. Cocaine is primarily transported in the country into the country by go-fast boats and shipping containers. From the Dominican Republic, traffickers often target Puerto Rico as a gateway into the US. Similarly, the territories of Guadeloupe, Martinique, Anguilla, Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands provide opportunities for organized crime groups to ship cocaine to France and the UK. Traffickers also often target Spain, where there is a substantial Dominican diaspora. This is how Spain has become the principal European entry point for cocaine from the Dominican Republic. Domestic drug consumption is primarily concentrated in metropolitan and tourist areas. ##&& While the cocaine trade is the most pervasive drug market in the Dominican Republic, cannabis is the most consumed drug in the country. Cannabis is trafficked into the country primarily across the land border with Haiti, where the drug is cultivated, and from Jamaica. Criminal networks from both the Dominican Republic and Haiti work collaboratively in the trafficking of cannabis, which is often imported into the country by truck, either camouflaged or hidden among other products. ##&& The Dominican Republic is also an important regional transit hub for heroin, often destined for the US market, but some domestic heroin consumption does take place. Additionally, the Dominican Republic is a small trans-shipment point for Ecstasy moving from its countries of origin, the Netherlands and Belgium, to North America, and potentially also for fentanyl coming from Mexico.","text - criminal actors":"Inside the Dominican Republic, gangs known as naciones and pandillas dominate the organized crime landscape. The most prominent groups are the Latin Kings, Los Trinitarios (a New York-based gang), the Bloods, Los 42, Met\u00e1licos, \u00d1etas, Mercaderos, Dorados and Rastafrys, among others. These groups have a presence in the larger cities of both the Dominican Republic and the US, and are involved in drug retailing, extortion, racketeering and money laundering. While the influence of these gangs may have waned in recent years, they still appear to have significant territorial control and often have the capacity to provide services within their territories. While evidence suggests that organized crime in the Dominican Republic is dominated by gangs, criminal networks play important roles in the human trafficking, human smuggling and drug trafficking markets, as well as some of the smaller criminal markets such as the environmental or natural resources market. ##&& Criminal markets, including the narcotics market, rely heavily on transnational links: to Dominican nationals operating abroad, to foreign networks and to foreign individuals living and operating in the Dominican Republic. State-embedded actors are involved in various criminal activities, particularly in the drug trade. There have been multiple cases of military and police personnel participating in drug trafficking, and of links between drug traffickers and high-level officials and politicians.","text - leadership and governance":"Leaders in the Dominican Republic have made a number of statements warning of the threat of organized crime and drug trafficking in particular, but the rhetoric has yet to be followed up with concrete and effective action. Levels of perceived corruption in the Dominican Republic are high and recent administrations have failed to tackle the country\u2019s systemic issues with corruption. Without a dedicated anti-corruption institution, the Dominican Republic has major flaws in its framework for combating and deterring corruption. ##&& The Dominican Republic has signalled that it is committed to international cooperation on anti-organized crime and is party to a number of treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. An extradition law is in place, and the Dominican Republic has extradition agreements with the United States, Brazil, Panama, Mexico, Italy, Spain, Chile and Haiti, as well as members of the Organization of American States. In addition, INTERPOL cooperates with national police in the Dominican Republic via its office in Santo Domingo. The Dominican Republic has domestic legislation specifically targeting some criminal markets, including the importing of weapons, parts and ammunition, the possession and trafficking of drugs, and money laundering. However, the country does not appear to have domestic legislation specific to organized criminal groups, and there is no evidence to suggest that membership of a criminal group is criminalized.","text - criminal justice and security":"Although nominally independent, the judiciary often suffers from political interference, corruption and a lack of adequate resources and personnel.

The former often suffer overcrowding and a high number of pre-trial detainees, while no such issues are reported in relation to the latter. Law enforcement in the Dominican Republic is challenged by high levels of corruption. At the same time, however, there have been some improvements and the national police in the Dominican Republic has established dedicated units for narcotics, human trafficking and cybercrime. The country\u2019s geographic location along major drug-trafficking routes continues to be a major source of vulnerability.","text - economic and financial environment":"The Dominican Republic has one of the more dynamic economies in the Caribbean and has experienced sustained growth for a number of years. Although poverty rates have been successfully reduced, there is a significant informal economy embedded within the country, and private-sector development is restrained by factors such as the lack of a robust economic regulatory framework. ##&& The risk of money laundering in the Dominican Republic is moderate. Despite recent updates to the country\u2019s anti-money laundering regulations and a strengthening of the financial intelligence unit, the latest Financial Action Task Force follow-up report notes that deficiencies remain. Numerous factors, including corruption, a large informal sector and weak financial controls, make the country vulnerable to money laundering and illicit financial flows. Moreover, the Dominican Republic has a weak asset forfeiture regime that is not aligned with international standards. On the other hand, the Dominican Republic is not a major secrecy jurisdiction and fares reasonably well when it comes to banking transparency.","text - civil society and social protection":"The penal code in the Dominican Republic guarantees victims and witnesses of crime the right to protection. However, the efficiency of the witness protection programme has been questioned in the past. The government has launched initiatives for assisting drug users, for instance through the introduction of an opioid substitution programme and initiatives that introduce alternatives to imprisonment for drug offenders. At the same time, however, there are significant deficiencies in the Dominican Republic\u2019s response to human trafficking and the country lacks mechanisms to support trafficking victims. The government has introduced crime-prevention strategies such as a community policing force focused on crime prevention and public safety. Furthermore, a community youth police programme is in operation. The country is home to many active civil- society organizations and movements and the government has taken steps to increase the space for civil society. Press freedom is still often undermined and many journalists self-censor due to fear of violence. Nevertheless, the Dominican Republic has seen a steady improvement in freedom of the media in recent years.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Santo Domingo","GDP (current $US million)":"88941.30","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"10738958","Land Area (sq. km)":"48670","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"64.7","Freedom in the World Index":"67","Human Development Index":"0.76","Global Peace Index":"1.99","Democracy Index":"6.32","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"28","GDP per capita (current US$)":"8282","1":"5.15","1.1":"5.30","1.2":"5.00","2":"4.67"},{"Corresp":"51","ISO-3":"ECU","Country":"Ecuador","ISO-2":"EC","Continent":"Americas","Region":"South America","Flag file":"ec.png","1.

Consequently, violence and use of firearms is on the rise.","text - environment":"Flora and fauna crimes are widespread in Ecuador. Illegal logging, including of protected species such as mahogany and cedar, is reported in protected areas, particularly around the Amazon rainforest. Peruvian loggers are believed to be behind this criminal market, paying bribes to officials in order to move the illegally extracted wood, sometimes alongside legal shipments. Active military personnel has also been implicated as a criminal element in the illicit flora market, facilitating the trafficking of timber by means of exploiting information as well as the logistics capacity of the military. Although the Ecuadorian market is comparatively smaller than those in neighbouring countries, it has a high value. As one of the most megadiverse countries in the world, Ecuador is highly attractive for traffickers looking for exotic wildlife species, including birds \u2013 particularly parrots \u2013 reptiles, mammals and shark fins for China. Ecuador is also vulnerable to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Both domestic and international consumption of protected animals as pets and even bushmeat is putting many species under threat. ##&& The non-renewable-resource criminal market is dominated by illegal mining, mostly of gold \u2013 which is the main economic activity in some areas of the country \u2013 and fuel smuggling. The market is largely controlled by domestic criminal networks, with Colombian crime groups heavily involved in transportation across the border, particularly gasoline, which is used to process cocaine. ","text - drugs":"Ecuador is a major trans-shipment hub for Peruvian and Colombian cocaine trafficked to large markets including the United States and Europe. Trafficking is largely controlled by Mexican and Colombian mafia groups and cartels, which team up with local gangs. Drugs are generally moved by road to the country\u2019s main ports, from which they are transported by boat and light aircraft to the United States and by cargo ships to Europe. Ecuador also produces limited amounts of cannabis, which fail to meet local demand for the most consumed drug in the country. In addition, Ecuador is a trans-shipment point for cannabis from Colombia to Chile. ##&& Heroin is also transported through Ecuador to the United States and Europe and for domestic consumption. Foreign guerrilla groups who have laid down their arms and moved across the border into Ecuador seem to control the market in collaboration with domestic criminal gangs. The market for synthetic drugs is considered high, with lifetime prevalence of Ecstasy use among young people increasing fairly quickly. With other synthetic drugs coming into the country, authorities have now come to regard synthetic drug production and consumption an issue of increasing concern.","text - criminal actors":"Ecuador\u2019s most powerful mafia-style groups have traditionally operated in collaboration with foreign mafias, particularly from neighbouring Colombia and Mexico, to facilitate transport and logistics. There is also growing evidence of the presence of organized crime groups from the Balkans for the most part involved in drug trafficking, and China, engaging primarily in human smuggling. Domestic mafia-style groups are also involved in criminal activities such as assassinations, extortion, kidnappings, illegal mining and money laundering. Other types of mafia-style groups in Ecuador are gangs, although these have been in decline over the last decade, partly as a result of government policies aimed at increasing social inclusion, innovative approaches to criminal justice (including the legalization of several of these groups) and police reform, which have also helped reduce the homicide rate in the country. The most powerful groups use sophisticated weapons, ammunition and explosives, mostly obtained through corrupt officials at all levels who also facilitate drug and illegal gold trafficking by waiving shipments, providing security and granting impunity. ##&& Endemic corruption in Ecuador renders state-embedded actors quite influential. These actors are known to facilitate criminal markets, especially the drug trade. Criminal groups makes use of close ties to officials in order to get their illegal shipments through border controls. However, state embedded actors also provide security detail to shipments or otherwise assist traffickers in transporting drug cargoes. While not as influential, loose criminal networks also operate in Ecuador. They operate mostly at the city or provincial level, engaging on the drug- and human-trafficking markets. Some of these criminal structures are believed to be functional within the prison system as well, exerting a significant degree of violence and extortion.","text - leadership and governance":"Despite still being considered a moderately fragile state, Ecuador has made improvements over the last decade, as illustrated by the reduction in its murder rate. Nevertheless, organized crime has infiltrated public institutions and compromised their integrity, significantly damaging public trust in authorities. The ability of authorities to maintain public security is also impaired because of their inability to monopolize the use of legitimate violence. Corruption remains a considerable challenge, with implementation of existing legislation and access to information considered to be low. Because of budget cuts, coupled with corruption allegations against key political figures, the number of public institutions tasked with ensuring transparency and public information has been reduced, which has deepened public mistrust in the public sector as a whole and the judiciary in particular. ##&& Regarding Ecuador\u2019s legal framework, the national laws are robust and adequate to combat organized crime. Despite the extensive and inclusive legal framework, implementation of laws remains a challenge. The country has signed and ratified a number of treaties and conventions to fight organized crime (with the exception of the Arms Trade Treaty) and has extradition agreements with key countries in the region. However, the resources to put them into practice are often lacking. The country has several cooperation agreements to strengthen the fight against criminal markets, including with Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Peru, Mexico and the United States (one of its key allies).","text - criminal justice and security":"The lack of independence of Ecuador\u2019s judiciary limits the country\u2019s ability to effectively pursue corruption and money-laundering investigations, including those related to organized crime, and weakens the rule of law. In the last two years, several judges have been dismissed for serious violations, including involvement in drug trafficking. The country\u2019s penitentiary system is generally overcrowded, with prisons largely controlled by mafia-style groups violently fighting for control. There is a specialized law enforcement unit in the country, dedicated to countering organized crime that effectively collaborates with international counterparts. In spite the police force in Ecuador being recognized as one of the most professional in Latin America, however, law enforcement in the country suffers significant drawbacks. Among the major challenges faced are the lack of resources, the limited capacity to monitor and patrol the entire territory of the country as well as the significant delays caused by heavy bureaucracy. Importantly, corruption also opens up a vulnerability of the police force to corruption, especially against the backdrop of the surge of Andean cocaine. ##&& Located between two of the largest cocaine producers globally \u2013 Peru and Colombia, Ecuador experiences increased pressures from drug traffickers. Estimates point to a third of Colombian cocaine being trafficked through Ecuador either through the Pacific or the Amazon route. The ability of authorities to monitor and patrol the northern border of the country is impaired due to the difficult jungle terrain. As a result, the territory is largely controlled by drug cartels. The southern border is also vulnerable, but much less so than the northern border. To counter border vulnerabilities, action plans foreseeing significant investments have been approved. It is, however, early for assessments of their effectiveness to be made. The Venezuelan crisis and subsequent influx of migrants into Ecuador have further challenged Ecuador's territorial integrity.","text - economic and financial environment":"Ecuador has a sound legal framework to fight money laundering and institutions in charge of implementing it, including by monitoring suspicious transactions. Although the country is also part of international groups working to tackle money laundering and terrorism financing, these crimes are still common and very few charges end in a criminal conviction. Ecuador is believed to be home to hundreds of ghost companies used to launder money or evade tax, most commonly in the mining, real-estate, car sales, banking, tourism, security and retail-jewellery sectors. Finally, Ecuador is assessed as a moderate-risk country when it comes to doing business, with the government\u2019s recent tax cuts and loan incentives for entrepreneurs meeting a challenging economic context in which nearly half the population works informally.

Although some progress has been made, much needs to be done to address the domestic and international trafficking from El Salvador and neighbouring countries. Victims are often subjected to kidnapping and sexual exploitation, or are coerced into perpetrating violent acts for street gangs. Women and girls forced into prostitution frequently become victims of gender-based violence.Traffickers are usually the same nationality as their victims, and some victims subsequently run trafficking networks. There has been a recent increase in the use ofonline platforms and offers ofdomestic employment to lure victims into, for example, forced marriage. Victims trafficked internationally are subjected to forced labour in Guatemala, Mexico, Belize and the US, while those trafficked domestically are used as forced labour in the agriculture and textile industries, domestic service, begging and sex trafficking. ##&& Massive levels of displacement caused by criminal groups, violence and poverty in El Salvador have resulted in organized, highly profitable human-smuggling networks. As a result, nearly a quarter of the country\u2019s native-born population live outside its borders. Human smuggling in El Salvador typically involves loose national criminal networks that pay quotas to foreign transnational groups for passages, and liaise with corrupt state actors to facilitate the smuggling. Mexican and Colombian networks are also active in the country. Those who are smuggled face a gamut of risks: death, abandonment, extortion, kidnapping, human trafficking, sexual violence, torture and exposure to environmental elements.","text - trade":"Most homicides in El Salvador are committed withfirearms. Many criminal actors possess illegal firearms and, considering the high rate of homicides, it is likely that the impact of illegal firearms is significant. Although some gangs carry out violent activities, such as extortion using firearms legally available on the domestic and international markets, there are a few large criminal groups that also traffic weapons. The latter is a crime of opportunity, fuelled by the availability of weapons in the region, leftover stocks from past conflicts, and the constant movement of people and goods to and from the US (the largest purveyor of legally purchased weapons in the region). The market is driven by demand from all types of criminal organizations and drug wars, as well as the lack of state monopoly on security in many areas, and high levels of violence and impunity. Weapons, such as grenades, are also stolen from army stock piles and smuggled to Mexico.","text - environment":"El Salvador is the only country in the world where mining for metals is completely banned, and the ban appears to have been effective. In contrast, fauna and flora crimes are significant issues in El Salvador, with perpetrators predominantly acting independently as loose criminal networks. Nonetheless, wildlife crime is often mingled with drug trafficking in the region, making it harder to counter these illicit markets separately. El Salvador is a source country, and a transit and destination market for illegal fauna exports from neighbouring Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Hundreds of birds are poached annually, and in recent years, several endangered birds indigenous to Nicaragua, such asparrots and macaws, are trafficked to the central market in San Salvador. The impact of fauna trafficking on biodiversity is substantial, since many of the species captured and sold illegally are endangered or nearly extinct; the most commonly confiscated species being parrots and iguanas. Of the millions of iguanas from captive breeding facilities exported for the pet trade, more than half may be wild, caught in neighbouring countries. With regard to flora crime, logging is a significant problem in El Salvador and it is likely that illegal logging for fuel and building materials constitutes a large part of this. Illegal logging does not appear to generate violence, and authorities do not usually intervene.","text - drugs":"Unlike neighbouring countries, El Salvador is not a major trafficking hub for cocaine. However, the market is large relative to the country\u2019s size and to other parts of the world. Currently, there is little domestic cocaine or crack use, but its popularity is growing. Criminal networks are involved in cocaine transportation and have collaborated with Mexican and Colombian cartels. This is a major source of violence, primarily between gangs vying for retail space, and between wholesale distributors. Some illicit actors have even built up political or economic fiefdoms that could challenge state supremacy and systematically undermine the rule of law. Tonnes of cocaine are intercepted annually, partly through operations carried out by the Salvador an naval force. With regard to cannabis, El Salvador is not part of the major regional trafficking route from Guatemala and Mexico to the US. However, gangs are major distributors of cannabis and disputes over retail space often generate violence. An increase in arrests and prosecutions forlow-level dealing is resulting injails filling up. Compared to the cocaine and cannabis markets, the presence and use of synthetic drugs and heroin are negligible.","text - criminal actors":"The two dominant rival mafia-style groups in El Salvador are MS-13 (the common name for Mara Salvatrucha) and Barrio 18, the latter of which has split into two factions, the Sure\u00f1os and Revolucionarios. The tens of thousands of members of these gangs are typically young males from poor socio-economic backgrounds; they now forego their hallmark tattoos in order to avoid catching the attention of the authorities. These gangs maintain a presence in almost all municipalities, where extortion is their main revenue source. They also collect rent from those partaking in theft and resale, the sale of counterfeit goods (such as cigarettes), human smuggling and trafficking, and domestic drug dealing. In some areas, they maintain de facto control over the daily lives of communities. Gangs are known to pay off corrupt officials and have received money from the government in exchange for political support. They have almost complete control of the prison system, using prisons as administrative centres for organizing illicit activities. Significant access to firearms, resulting from permissive ownership laws, gun imports and leftover weapons from the civil war exacerbates the fierce rivalry between the MS-13 and Barrio 18 gangs, with violent turf wars contributing to internal displacement, mass migration and one of the highest national homicide rates per capita worldwide. Murder rates have decreased but there is debate as to whether this is the result of a hardline government response, or an apparent truce between the gangs. Recently, both gangs have contributed to enforcing COVID-19 restrictions, developing creative ways to continue collecting extortion payments from businesses. ##&& The two main groups involved in commodity trafficking, the Texis Cartel and Los Perrones, have seen their membership dismantled and replaced by loose criminal networks, which appear to avoid violence and largely succeed in operating outside the public eye. The Texis Cartel was made up of Salvadorans well established in politics and business who worked with international drug cartels in Colombia and Mexico to transit cocaine and other narcotics through El Salvador. Los Perrones were predominantly contraband transporters (transportistas) working with Colombian, Mexican and Guatemalan groups to traffic drugs and other products, such as contraband clothing, through Central America to the eastern front of El Salvador. Networks of transportistas (freight companies, hoteliers, human smugglers and contraband sellers) also operate along smuggling routes going north from El Salvador, cooperating with transnational groups smuggling people and contraband. ##&& Although Salvadoran criminal actors involved in drug trafficking, human trafficking and human smuggling cooperate with transnational groups (such as Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa Cartel), foreign groups do not have a significant presence within El Salvador. Furthermore, nothing suggests that state-embedded criminal groups exert control over any criminal market. There are, however, state actors who have facilitated criminal acts, protected criminal actors, obstructed criminal investigations, and sold weapons and ammunition to criminals on a regular basis. There is an indication that police systematically execute suspected gang members extrajudicially and share information on how to cover up these actions and obstruct investigations.v","text - leadership and governance":"El Salvador is a moderately stable country. Upon entering office in 2019, President Bukele enjoyed high levels of electoral supportwith an anti-corruption and security platform. Nonetheless, there is a general lack of confidence in political leadership, and government efforts to combat organized crime are largely ineffective, due in part to high-level corruption and collusion with criminal groups. In 2020, allegations were made \u2013 which have been denied by the president \u2013 that an informal non-aggression pact had been established between the government and El Salvador\u2019s major gangs. ##&& On the international stage, El Salvador has ratified all the relevant treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, but impunity and high-level corruption hinder the country\u2019s ability to comply with international standards.

MS-13 and Barrio18 members are sometimes held in the same cells, resulting in the prison system being largely overtaken by gangs. Organized-crime groups maintain widespread territorial control and enjoy high levels of impunity, with limited resources, low public trust in law enforcement, and violence perpetrated by state actors hindering advancements. While raids by special forces have crippled the operational capacity of some gangs, they have also undermined the collection of vital intelligence. El Salvador is home to land and maritime smuggling routes for illicit drugs, humans, weapons and contraband. Its borders are porous, a situation exacerbated by limited resources, infrastructure and corruption. ","text - economic and financial environment":"El Salvador is at considerable risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. The veto of legislative reform, which would have given autonomy to the principal anti-money-laundering investigative body (Unidad de Investigaci\u00f3n de Delitos Financieros), resulted in the country\u2019s suspension from the Egmont Group \u2013 an international organization of finance intelligence units \u2013 and severely tarnished the legitimacy and effectiveness of the country\u2019s anti-money-laundering capacity. Crime, insecurity and \u2018burdensome\u2019 regulations also hinder economic growth (the country has consistently the lowest growth rate in Central America). The government\u2019s inability to protect legitimate businesses from criminal activity, notably extortion, may partly explain the widespread reliance on informal practices.","text - civil society and social protection":"More can be done in El Salvador to identify victims of modern slavery and to support their exit. Government services for identifying and supporting organized-crime victims are often inadequate, with particularly limited services for women, children and LGBTI victims of human trafficking. There has been continued reliance on civil society organizations, which play the leading role in victim support and fill gaps left by the state, often cooperating with international organizations. Churches, in particular, fill a fundamental gap when it comes to attempts to demobilize gang members. The media is relatively free of political interference and is the main source of independent reporting on organized crime and state corruption, despite frequent harassment of the press by state actors. Legislation provides little protection, with journalists who try to investigate corruption or government finances being threatened or harassed.

There are believed to be many more illicit arms than registered ones in Guatemala, partly as a consequence of the country\u2019s internal armed conflict. Arms trafficking is facilitated by a lack of control and understaffing at the country's border posts, and contributes to violence across the country, with more than 80% of homicides being committed with firearms.","text - environment":"Guatemala is a source country for illicit flora trafficking, with Rosewood, a rare species that is present only in a small number of areas across the world, constituting a large part of the market. The Rosewood-trafficking market is controlled by large criminal organizations who work in cooperation with local farmers and criminals from China, where demand for this particular woodis high. Rosewood traffickers also transport scarlet macaws, monkeys and reptilesillegally along similar routes,with many of the animals ultimately being sold to foreign buyers.The unclear demarcation of the Guatemala-Belize border, limited cross-border cooperation, and the low priority given to flora-and-fauna trafficking hinders the Guatemalan security forces' ability to carry out activities against these crimes. ##&& While non-renewable resource crimes are comparably limited, electricity theft and illegal mining are the two main non-renewable-resource crimes that take place in Guatemala.Local communities are largely responsible for the former, and foreign mining multinationals for the latter.

Its heroin trade has grown in recent years and is concentrated along the Guatemalan-Mexican border, at the hands of Mexican cartels and local criminals. The cocaine trade however, is Guatemala\u2019s main illicit-drug market. The country is a major transit point for cocaine produced in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. It arrives by sea, land and air on its way to the United States. As much as 90% of cocaine trafficked into the US passes through Guatemala. Local criminal organizations also produce cocaine, as well as synthetic drugs. The domestic cultivation of coca is reportedly on the rise, but local consumption is minimal. Guatemala is a source, transit and destination country for cannabis, mainly for domestic and regional consumption, although the market is relatively small when compared to other drug types. Synthetic drugs are sourced and transited through the country on their way to Mexico and the United States.","text - criminal actors":"Guatemala is home to a number of relatively sophisticated mafia-style groups \u2013most notably, international gangs such as Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18 \u2013who operate mostly in drug-trafficking markets, but also take part in arms trafficking, human trafficking and smuggling, transporting contraband into and out of the country, and extortion. There are both foreign and local gangs in Guatemala, operating predominantly in its main cities. The drug-trafficking groups tend to be organized around a single leader and have moderate membership; whereas those that focus their activities on extortion, money lending and drug peddling are organized in vertical hierarchies, with multiple leaders and large memberships. Some estimates suggest there are between 10000 and 20000 gang members in the country. ##&& While territorial disputes still occur between Guatemala's mafia-style groups, these have been on a downward trend in the past few years, due mainly to a clearer demarcation of their territories and the detention of the most aggressive drug leaders. The more minor gangs in Guatemala are known to be extremely violent, engaging in torture and using small weapons to carry out selective killings or intimidate their extortion victims. The drug cartels are generally less violent, but use more brutal force and high-powered weapons. ##&& Drug trafficking in Guatemala is controlled largely by Mexican drug cartels \u2013for example, the Cartel de Sinaloa, the Cartel del Golfo and Los Zetas \u2013 particularly in border regions such as Zacapa, Alta Verapaz and Pet\u00e9n. Because Guatemala is predominantly a transit country for drug trafficking, most of the local gangs and other criminal actors collaborate with the larger international criminal groups that dominate the market. ##&& Guatemala\u2019s criminal markets are all supported by corrupt state-embedded actors, who either facilitate or engage directly in criminal operations. Low- and medium-level law-enforcement entitiesare often associated with gangs, while the drug cartels are reportedly connected across all levels of the state apparatus. ","text - leadership and governance":"Although the issue of organized crime features in most political campaigns in Guatemala, efforts to fight it have been largely ineffective. Most anti-organized-crime and anti-corruption initiatives have been unsuccessful due to a lack of political support, funding and continuity. In 2019, the Guatemalan authorities ended the mandate ofaUN-backed special anti-impunity commission, which had, since 2007, assisted in the high-level investigation and prosecution of key figures (including former presidents and other high-ranking officials) on corruption charges, as well as trained the prosecutor\u2019s office on how to handle complex crimes. ##&& Despite the existence of anti-corruption and pro-transparency laws, and Guatemala's participation in international treaties and cooperation agreements, organized crime continues to penetrate the country's political system, particularly via links between drug cartels and members of congress, the army and law-enforcement authorities. Collusion between local-level politicians, security forces and criminal organizations is widespread along Guatemala's drug-trafficking routes. These challenges are reflected in the low rate of public trust in Guatemala's authorities.","text - criminal justice and security":"Guatemala\u2019s does not have robust judicial mechanisms, and its judiciary is therefore not able to deal with a large number of complex cases. Its courts are overloaded, understaffed and limited by lagging bureaucratic procedures and delays, particularly since the departure of the UN's anti-impunity commission. The state lacks control over its 22 prisons, which suffer from extreme violence, poor living conditions and severe overcrowding, mostly due to rampant corruption and understaffing. Because of these poor conditions, organized crime has flourished inside the prisons, which have become operation centres for the country\u2019s most prominent gangs. Guatemala has a number of law-enforcement units, including within the national police force, that specialize in tackling organized crime, drug trafficking, extortion and kidnapping. Although some of these units have had limited success, their work continues to be negatively affected by corruption, understaffing, inadequate resources, a lack of trust and poor coordination with the public ministry's investigators. ##&& Guatemala\u2019s strategic location in a major trafficking corridor between South and North America makes it an important location for criminal operations. In spite of some government programmes that have tried to tackle the issue, its borders are porous and consist of hundreds of blind spots without a state presence. The government also faces serious challenges when it comes to exerting its authority in areas controlled by gangs. ","text - economic and financial environment":"Guatemala\u2019s laws, norms and institutional capacity to combat money laundering are extensive and at least nominally fulfil most international obligations, which makes the country fairly resilient to this activity, as well as to terrorist financing. Legitimate businesses are able to operate relatively freely and to expand, despite restrictive regulations. However, extortion remains widespread in Guatemala, with victims ranging from small to medium businesses (including transport companies, cattle farms, small financial companies and private-security companies), to large multinationals, particularly in the telecommunications sector.","text - civil society and social protection":"Guatemala has a special unit for crime victims, as well as a witness-protection programme. However, these services tend to be limited in practice and are in many cases provided by civil-society organizations. Crime prevention is a relatively new concept in Guatemala. Until fairly recently, the authorities focused on hard-line strategies designed to punish rather than prevent problems \u2013 for example, drug consumption was perceived as a criminal issue rather than a health one. However, there are now some interventions that focus on community services, vulnerable groups and behavioural change. ##&& Civil society and the media play an important role in fighting organized crime in Guatemala. They keep the public informed and promote solutions, despite working in hostile environments. Guatemala is considered one of the most dangerous countries in the Americas for journalists, with many of them being attacked or even killed for their work.

A large quantity of gold is trafficked every month and then moved into the international licit supply chain, where it is presented as Guyanese gold. Guyana is one of the few countries in Latin America that still grants mercury-import licenses, even though the chemical, which is still used in small-scale mining, is known to pose a significant threat to human health and the environment.

Similarly, with regard to flora crimes, birds, reptiles (including iguanas, turtles and vipers) and jaguars are among the most-trafficked species for consumption, ownership as exotic pets, and animal parts. ##&& A minimal market for non-renewable-resource crimes exists in Honduras, mainly in the form of small-scale illicit gold mining, which is managed by local individuals with little apparent involvement from large crime organizations.The theft of oil, which is then smuggled into the country, particularly from Mexico, reportedly takes place at the hands of powerful local gangs. ","text - drugs":"Honduras\u2019s location in the centre of one of the main drug-trafficking corridors in the region \u2013 coupled with signs of increasing production in the country and evidence of senior government officials being involved in the trade \u2013 puts the country at the centre of the region\u2019s criminal map. Large organizations work as the middlemen between Colombian cocaine producers and Mexican traffickers. They transport the drug through Honduras by land, sea and air from Mexico, El Salvador and Guatemala to the United States. Local organizations are reported to be behind the new plantations and laboratories that have sprung up in a bid to control more elements of the supply chain than just transport. ##&& Cannabis is believed to be one of the most sold drugs locally. Due to criminal groups looking to increase their profits, both consumption and cultivation have increased in recent years, as has the sale of krispy, a chemically laced cannabis derivative. Honduras\u2019s heroin trade appears to be relatively insignificant, with sporadic reports of opioid trafficking to and from the country over the past decade. Although the use of synthetic drugs is very low, precursor chemicals have reportedly been seized. These chemicals are believed to be mainly for the production of methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs, which are then supplied to criminal organizations in Mexico.","text - criminal actors":"In recent years, international gangs such as MS-13 and Barrio 18 have come to dominate Honduras\u2019s criminal landscape. Both these organizations have hierarchical structures, exert considerable control over the areas in which they operate, use extreme violence and draw much of their power from the prison system. MS-13 has developed a more business-oriented and discrete profile, with a relatively large membership and deep collective identity, while Barrio 18 still takes a more traditional approach. These mafia-style groups work alongside other criminal networks to dominate the cocaine-trafficking and distribution markets. They are also involved in other criminal activities such as car theft and the extortion of large businesses.The more traditional drug-trafficking organizations engage in activities such as timber trafficking, mainly for money-laundering proposes. ##&& Honduras is home to many family-based transportista groups, who transport illegal goods, provide security for illicit cargo and carry out other logistics-related tasks. It also has a number of loose criminal networks that are involved in a widerange of criminal markets, including drugs, arms and human trafficking; human smuggling; and flora-and-fauna and non-renewable-resource crimes. Honduras's organized-crime groups are believed to operate in collusion with the authorities at all levels \u2013 including law enforcement, ministers, majors, members of congress and even presidents. Foreign criminal organizations, mainly from Colombia and Mexico but also from El Salvador, are active in Honduras. They tend to focus on drug processing and trafficking, among other criminal activities.","text - leadership and governance":"Corruption has severely damaged governance in Honduras, with high-level government officials accused of colluding with criminal organizations despite public promises to tackle gangs. While some measures have been taken, including a purge of the police and the extradition of some criminal suspects to the United States, entrenched corruption has undermined these efforts and led to high levels of public distrust in politicians and institutions, including the executive, congress, judiciary and security forces. ##&& Honduras has signed a number of international treaties on organized crime. It also has a range of national laws to fight the problem, as well as to punish corruption and ensure transparency. However, it has faced serious challenges regarding their effective implementation, including suggestions that they protect the interests of powerful elites. The country has benefited from international cooperation initiatives with the United States, most notably in relation to intelligence and anti-gang measures, community-policing strategies and extradition arrangements.The Organization of American States is credited with the establishment of the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras \u2013which, among other things, helped pass a campaign-finance law, created a special prosecution unit, and drew attention to several high-profile corruption cases. The body, however, was constantly undermined by political and economic elites, which led to its end in early 2020, after the authorities failed to renew its mandate.","text - criminal justice and security":"Honduras\u2019s judiciary is considered to be extremely inefficient, corrupt, underfinanced and understaffed. It is politicized and subject to intimidation and attacks. Impunity levels run high, particularly in cases against the country\u2019s elite, which has led to very low levels of public trust. Honduras\u2019s location at the centre of a major trafficking corridor for humans, drugs and illicit goods heading from South America to the United States make law enforcement a challenging task, as do the country\u2019s thick forests and collection of islands. A severe lack of resources, including equipment and training, coupled with allegations of systemic corruption, restricts the capacity of Honduras\u2019s security agencies. The country\u2019s overcrowded, unsanitary and understaffed prisons, controlled mostly by criminal organizations, exacerbate the problem. ","text - economic and financial environment":"Honduras has been assessed as having a high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. Its capacity to fight these crimes is hindered by a lack of investigative capabilities, training, cooperation, transparency and information sharing. Another challenge is the country's economic regulatory system, which is believed to disproportionately benefit private companies, many of which are involved in corruption or owned by criminal organizations that control sectors of the economy. Honduras is home to a very large informal sector, which affects the authorities\u2019 ability to control cash flows and customs. This makes doing business in Honduras particularly difficult.","text - civil society and social protection":"Support for the victims and witnesses of crime is limited to non-existent, with a noticeable lack of resources or institutions. Although the authorities run programmes to fight drug trafficking and consumption, they tend to take a punitive rather than a preventative approach. A 2019 report stated that the police narcotics bureau's prevention unit had only two staff members with no relevant training, while other government-led prevention programmes, including those funded by the United States and aimed at tackling gang activity, suffered severe cuts or were fully terminated. Most prevention programmes are run by civil-society and foreign-aid organizations, with some faith-based organizations and NGOs allowed to operate in gang-controlled territories, where they act as mediators between criminal organizations and security institutions. ##&& Honduras is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for activists \u2013 in particular, those who work to protect the environment. They are often the targets of smear campaigns, attacks and even killings. The country is also unsafe for journalists and media workers, who are often threatened or attacked for reporting on issues related to government corruption and crime, with many self-censoring out of fear.

The market also benefits from police corruption, with officers often being implicated in the disappearance of guns from police stations.","text - environment":"While instances of illegal logging and the illicit trade of rare species have been documented, the flora- and fauna-crimes market are negligible, and there is no evidence to suggest that a market for non-renewable crimes exists in Jamaica.","text - drugs":"The reach of Jamaica\u2019s cannabis market is substantial. The country is the largest producer and supplier of cannabis in the Caribbean region. The drug is trafficked abroad to countries in Europe, as well as to Canada and the United States. In Jamaica, marijuana is legal for consumption in low quantities and for religious purposes, although permits are required to cultivate and process the crop. Evidence suggests that growth in the cannabis trade has led to an escalation in violence in Jamaica. There seems to be a connection between organizations that traffic cannabis and those that traffic arms and cocaine, a drug that is also highly prevalent in the country. ##&& In recent decades, Jamaica has become a trans-shipment and storage point for Mexican and Colombian organizations transporting cocaine to the United States and Europe. Cocaine shipments tend to be dropped offshore by ships or small planes, and then picked up by boats to be taken to their final locations by foreign tourists (not always knowingly). Heroin and synthetic drugs are also prevalent in the country, although to a much lesser extent than cocaine. They are used as commodity drugs, traded with marijuana and then shipped in small quantities to overseas markets through immigrant networks. The local market is believed to be very small.","text - criminal actors":"Dozens of criminal gangs operate across Jamaica. The larger groups are involved mostly in international drug trafficking, while the smaller, more loosely organized ones engage in more violent crimes, particularly turf wars to exert control over communities. Most of these criminal groups are believed to use extortion, particularly of informal sellers and small businesses in exchange for protection, as a form of control and a way to finance their operations. They are also believed to benefit from state collusion \u2013 there are corrupt police officers who facilitate their activities and politicians who award them contracts in exchange for support, as well as pay them to carry out crimes (including killings) for their political gain. ##&& Foreign criminal organizations, most notably from Colombia and Mexico, feature in Jamaica\u2019s underworld, using the country as a trans-shipment and storage point for drugs on their way to international markets, including the United States. Jamaican groups operate in other countries through their diasporas. Criminal networks in Jamaica tend to be loosely knit organizations made up of young people who engage predominantly in robberies and scams.","text - leadership and governance":"While Jamaica is not considered a fragile state, its overall governance, high levels of violence, low public trust in authorities, and lack of accountability and transparency remain substantial challenges. Nevertheless, compared to other smaller states in the Caribbean, Jamaica\u2019s state capacity is far greater, although so too are the threats it faces. Jamaica\u2019s legal framework on organized crime is fairly strong, especially when it comes to gang activity, although its implementation is not particularly efficient. ##&& Jamaica has ratified a number of international conventions and protocols on organized crime, including drug and people trafficking. Jamaica is also party to relevant wildlife protection agreements. It also benefits from international cooperation in the form of financial support for community programmes, as well from coordination with law-enforcement agencies in other countries, particularly the United States, to stop the transit of illegal drugs by sea.","text - criminal justice and security":"Jamaica\u2019s efforts to bring criminal networks to justice, including through the implementation of a justice-sector-reform programme, are hampered by an under-resourced and overburdened judiciary, leading to repeated trial delays; significant case backlogs; frustration among police, witnesses, jurors and the public; and impunity for many offenders. In addition, deep-rooted corruption \u2013 including allegations of police officers working directly with criminals and committing extra-judicial executions \u2013 overshadows some of the positive initiatives that have been put in place to try and tackle criminal markets involving people trafficking, gang recruitment and scamming. Nevertheless, law enforcement in Jamaica is making significant efforts to root out internal corruption, in particular through the Major Organized Crime and Anti-Corruption Agency. ##&& Jamaica's geographical location in the Caribbean, its difficult-to-patrol coastline, its status as a tourist destination, and its favourable position as a major containerized cargo trans-shipment hub have all contributed to its appeal to drug- and arms-trafficking organizations. The control local gangs have on their communities and widespread corruption among officials make an efficient state presence challenging. To try and combat these issues, the authorities recently announced a large financial investment as part of its strategy to reduce crime. It purchased two ships for the Jamaican coast guard to try and improve border security, introduced a surveillance aircraft, and increased the use of scanners to inspect cargo at ports of entry.","text - economic and financial environment":"While Jamaica engages effectively in international-cooperation initiatives, and makes use of international legal assistance and extradition mechanisms, challenges within its micro-financing and legal-marijuana sectors make it vulnerable to money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Although a number of programmes are being implemented to enhance Jamaica\u2019s economy and tackle the influence of crime organizations on small businesses, doing business in the country is still considered difficult.","text - civil society and social protection":"The protection of witnesses remains a significant challenge in Jamaica.

The National Integrity Action, for example, is an important civil society organization working to combat corruption in Jamaica, and the signing of the National Consensus on Crime Memorandum of Understanding by leaders both within the state and civil society is an illustration of the successful collaboration between state and non-state actors on the issue of organized crime. Jamaica also has among the most free press environments globally.

However, domestic restrictions have not had a significant impact on Mexico\u2019s internal market, as lockdowns were poorly observed. Instead, the pandemic exacerbated collusion between corrupt officials and traffickers preying on migrants through forced engagement in criminal economies or extortion, with officials relying less on bribery and more on organized-crimelinksfor profits. ##&& Mexico's human-smuggling market is the largest and most sophisticated in the region, as it is a large country and serves as a source and transit country, primarily to the US. Although increasingly strict US border policies reduced demand, COVID-19 lockdowns exacerbated poverty, unemployment and violence across Central America, increasing irregular migration to the US via Mexico, primarily from the Northern Triangle countries. Smugglers reportedly stopped operating along certain border areas at the start of COVID-19 but resumed activities using US partners. The market's impact remains localized along the northern border and in cities along the southern border. Smugglers from southern Mexico are often local community members, smuggling individuals in cars, buses or trailers, while those in north-eastern Mexico are often part of larger organized groups that control smuggling networks. Smugglers frequently have links to transnational criminal groups, drug cartels and corrupt officials. ","text - trade":"Mexico has a well-consolidated arms-trafficking market. High demand for firearms from the US and Central America exists among criminal groups and civilians, while well-established mechanisms enable easy reach. Firearms cannot be lawfully purchased in Mexico, but citizens and drug cartels purchase US firearms and smuggle them across the border. The immense flow of illicit weapons from the US, coupled with grenades and RPG-7s from Central America and gun leakage from corrupt domestic-security forces, exacerbates gun violence and criminal armament.","text - environment":"Flora and fauna crimes are substantial in Mexico, with traffickers often active in other criminal markets. Drug traffickers control timber trafficking in Jalisco, forcing communities to pay quotas for protection, with protesters facing kidnapping or disappearance. Mexico is a source and transit country for regional flora commodities, especially between Brazil and the US. The illicit timber market has grown in the past three decades, affecting rural communities. Most timber sold is illegally sourced, generating hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Rosewood trafficking, controlled by Chinese mafias and other groups operating locally and regionally, is significant, and dozens of shipments, primarily destined for the Chinese furniture market, are seized annually across Pacific ports and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Violence occurs between competing criminal groups, while local populations, including indigenous communities, experience violence, displacement and disappearances at the hands of armed groups or corrupt law enforcement. ##&& Fauna crime is facilitated by corrupt authorities. Although traditionally a transit hub for wildlife trafficked to the US, Europe, China and elsewhere, Mexico is also a source and destination country. The market generates significant profits, and demand for Mexican wildlife has risen. Sought-after species include jaguars, golden eagles, parrots, macaws and reptiles. Totoaba fish are primarily destined for mainland China, with Chinese mafia involvement, and violence is seen in this economy, especially along the upper Gulf of California. The trade generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually, with one pound of totoaba swim bladder more valuable than cocaine. Mexico\u2019s illicit seacucumber trade is also significant, causing violence in Yucat\u00e1n and Campeche. ##&& Oil theft is increasing in Mexico, with some groups focused exclusively on these operations. Corrupt officials in the state oil company facilitate deals between oil executives and criminal groups, enabling theft and redistributing illicit profits. There is also illegal gold and silver mining, and formal companies face armed robberies, allegedly by cartels, as well as extortion and kidnapping of mining personnel. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, mining operations became an easy target due to weakened state capacity. Moreover, Mexico is the only country that produces cinnabar, the brick-red form of mercury, and cartels trafficmercury to be used in the gold mining process to South American countries where illicit gold-mining is prevalent.","text - drugs":"Most US heroin originates in Mexico, particularly in the Golden Triangle drug-producing region. Increased demand from US drug users shifting from prescription painkiller consumption to street heroin, due to the opioid epidemic, resulted in a production surge in Mexico. However, increasing poppy cultivation and oversupply is eroding the value of poppy paste. Mexican cartels also partake in the production and transportation of methamphetamine and, increasingly, fentanyl. Both are increasingly popular in the US, where fentanyl claims tens of thousands of lives annually. Fentanyl and its precursors are predominantly produced in China, with Mexican cartels importing and trafficking the products into the US, although domestic production also occurs. Fentanyl consumption is rising in Mexico, as a significant portion of street heroin in white powder and black tar forms is combined with fentanyl for longer-lasting effects. Nonetheless, COVID-19 disrupted fentanyl supply chains, pressuring cartels to seek new revenue streams. ##&& Although cannabis trafficking between Central America and the US has declined, Mexico still serves as America's largest foreign provider. However, cannabis legalization in some US states and Canada significantly damaged the market for Mexican cartels. As it is no longer a major cash crop, many farmers are shifting towards poppy cultivation. In Mexico, there are calls for legalization amid rising domestic demand for cannabis and cannabis products. Mexico's cocaine trade is less consolidated, due to internal fragmentation, but the market is large. Mexican actors serve as key brokers and transporters, and cartels have become more active in the Colombian and Central American cocaine industries. Much of the rival cartel violence relates to control of the north bound shipment routes.","text - criminal actors":"Mexico\u2019s drug-trafficking organizations are among the most sophisticated mafia-style groups in the world. Although cartel fragmentation reduced the number of groups with large international operations, those remaining have networks spanning most of the Americas, even stretching into Europe and Asia. Although drug-trafficking organizations interact with foreign actors, these generally lack a significant foothold in Mexico and their presence usually relates to collaborative business with Mexican groups. Drug-trafficking organizations focus on international drug trafficking, generating billions of dollars in revenue annually, but numerous revenue streams, including oil theft, illegal logging, human trafficking, kidnapping and extortion, are deeply entrenched. Mexican drug cartels possess firearms, including military-grade weapons, and conflict is widespread between competing groups and state security forces, with some groups marking their territory by displaying beheaded and mutilated corpses. Drug cartels control territory in much of Mexico, co-opting the state through bribery and intimidation with the aim of facilitating illicit activity and influencing the democratic process. Politicians are frequently murdered or threatened by mafias attempting to ensure that cooperative politicians hold office. ##&& Cartel fragmentation spawned smaller, loosely networked groups that lack a permanent power structure and are harder to track, causing security concerns as turf wars become more common place and localized. These groups generally lack the resources to manage transnational drug-trafficking networks, instead partaking in activities such as extortion, kidnapping, vehicletheft, oil smuggling, human smuggling and trafficking, retail drug sales and illegal mineral mining. They play crucial roles in the drug-trafficking supply chain, providing local transportation or security within larger networks. While state-embedded actors do not control criminal markets, corruption within government and law-enforcement agencies facilitates criminal networks and influences illicit activities, providing income for high-ranking public officials. ","text - leadership and governance":"A militarized, strong-arm approach to tackling organized crime has produced mixed results in Mexico. Corruption is rife, causing collusion between law enforcement, judges and criminals. Organized-crime-related violence and criminal impunity are ata record high, with poor access to legal proceedings, while the measures adopted to curb corruption and increase transparency lack implementation. Nonetheless, access to information regarding the legal framework appears strong. The government lacks a cohesive security strategy, with attempts to address corruption and organized crime seen as highly politicized or as efforts to embarrass past governments. The president is centralizing control across national institutions and has proposed new, technically illegal policies, such as having Marines in charge of port customs activities. ##&& Structural deficiencies in Mexico\u2019s legal system hamper its ability to fight organized crime. Although the country has ratified a range of international treaties and has numerous laws pertaining to organized crime, these are not well enforced and crippled by corruption. However, there is a history of strong anti-organized-crime cooperation with the US, with mutual extradition agreements and information-sharing by intelligence agencies. While the president has been flexible on issues such as migration with the US, there is uncertainty around the approach to security and organized crime.","text - criminal justice and security":"Mexico has a law-enforcement unit and a judiciary unit specifically mandated to counter organized crime. Nonetheless, corruption, inefficiency and lack of case investigation weaken the structures for prosecuting organized crime. Despite recent judicial reform, the country struggles to investigate and prosecute most serious crimes. Cases are often over-reliant on single eyewitness testimonies, allowing prosecutors to manipulate results. Tens of thousands are in pre-trial or remand imprisonment, suggesting a significant judicial deficiency in processing cases. Nonetheless, Mexico has made financial investments and structural changes to improve law-enforcement capacity against organized crime, and significant US donations aim to improve the country\u2019s security apparatus, as well as provide training, intelligence and planning. There is, however, substantial corruption within the police and, to a lesser extent, the military, with both accused of human-rights abuses. Public confidence is low, except in the Armed Forces. When top cartel leaders have been apprehended, the ensuing fragmentation has led to violence. ##&& Mexico\u2019s proximity to the US also makes it a major transit point for illegal drugs and a hub for activities such as human smuggling and arms trafficking, which thrive despite bilateral law-enforcement efforts. Large swathes of territory and ports are controlled by organized groups who operate above, or as, the law, acting as parallel or replacement powers. The president's National Guard, created to increase national security and tackle organized crime, is more focused on policing irregular migrants.","text - economic and financial environment":"Mexico is at high risk for money laundering and terrorist financing. Although a law exists, money laundering is not proactively investigated or prosecuted, particularly in transnational cases, resulting in low conviction rates.

Organized crime boosts money laundering while corruption undermines law-enforcement capacity. With businesses targeted for extortion and kidnapping, corruption is a significant risk for companies, making it difficult to attract foreign investors. The government has attempted to reassure investors, but has not yet instilled confidence.","text - civil society and social protection":"Although some mechanisms exist to help victims exit slavery, more is needed to improve victim-support frameworks.

Hundreds of active non-profit organizations were hit by the corruption crusade of the president, which froze federal funding on accusations of corruption and abuse. The media are seen as a threat and maligned by the administration, green-lighting long-standing violence against the media and making Mexico one of the deadliest countries for journalists.

Local crime organizations tend to collaborate with nationals from Costa Rica and Honduras to transport cocaine through Nicaragua, while Mexican cartels also have a strong presence in the country. The market is believed to have grown in recent years, partly aided by official corruption and involvement at the highest state level. Cannabis is the most widely consumed drug in the country and is particularly popular among teenagers, mostly because of its low price. Local groups control production in the country, which satisfies local demand. Additional quantities of cannabis are also trafficked from Honduras and Costa Rica, but groups from Nicaragua are again the organizers of these flows. ##&& Heroin and synthetic-drug markets are limited due to the relatively high price. The legal status of ketamine in Nicaragua makes it a source country, with ketamine mostly trafficked into Costa Rica, while methamphetamine produced in Nicaragua is distributed on the country\u2019s Caribbean coast.","text - criminal actors":"Nicaragua is home to a small number of mafia-style groups. Los Tarzanes is the most notorious, specializing in logistics and transport of cocaine from Colombia, marijuana from Jamaica into Nicaragua, Honduras and Mexico, precursor chemicals for methamphetamine production, weapons and other contraband. Other types of criminal networks are particularly prevalent in drug, human, wildlife and timber trafficking and tend to work with international counterparts including from Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Mexico. In addition, the prevalence of homegrown, paramilitary-style armed groups has increased in recent years, particularly since the start of the political and human-rights crisis in April 2018. Although the nature of the groups is contentious, there is growing evidence that these pro-government armed groups are operating across the country, using violence to silence critics and operating with support from the authorities at all levels. Overall, however, Nicaragua does not experience the same levels of violence at the hands of criminal actors as do other countries in Central America. ##&& State-embedded actors, going all the way to the highest levels of power, including members of the judiciary and parliamentarians, are deeply engaged in criminal markets in Nicaragua. Furthermore, a number of foreign actors, including Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas and Colombian and Venezuelan organizations, have established a presence in Nicaragua and control the cocaine-trafficking market in the country. These actors actively collaborate with local groups that provide them with services such as transportation and contacts.","text - leadership and governance":"Although Nicaragua does experience far lower levels of violence relative to other countries across the region, the country faces serious leadership and governance challenges, with the current presidential administration accused of colluding with drug-trafficking organizations, facilitating human-rights abuses and promoting corrupt practices. Despite official promises to combat organized crime through anti-drug-trafficking programmes, aiming to secure the country\u2019s borders, high-level members of the administration have come under fire for allegedly facilitating or actively participating in these crimes. In addition, authorities have been accused of grave human-rights violations after violently responding to a wave of protests that began in April 2018 in opposition to proposed changes to the social-security system. In the aftermath of the protests, more than 320 people died thousands of people were injured and hundreds were arbitrarily detained. Most of those who died were killed by agents of the state or members of armed groups aligned to the government. Furthermore, Nicaragua has transitioned further and further towards authoritarianism under President Ortega and governance has been affected by a lack of transparency across government institutions, a lack of integrity in public officials and the government\u2019s increased barriers to the access of public information, with official figures in areas including health, employment and gender equity either manipulated or simply not published since 2016. ##&& Although the country is party to most relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime and has extradition agreements with specific countries, Nicaraguan nationals cannot be extradited. This has helped high-profile individuals accused of crimes including corruption and money laundering to escape justice. While the country is working with international partners, including Honduras, to reduce illicit activities at the border, and Russia, on capacity-building for law enforcement, a number of international actors have severely criticized the country\u2019s human-rights and corruption record, including by threatening or imposing sanctions. At the national level, Nicaragua\u2019s legal framework includes some laws aimed at tackling organized crime, but these fail to include crimes against natural resources, such as illegal gold-mining, timber trafficking and wildlife trafficking. Meanwhile, some recently approved laws severely limit the work of human-rights and political organizations.","text - criminal justice and security":"Nicaragua\u2019s judiciary is extremely corrupt and ineffective, with its members appointed by Congress, which is controlled by the governing party. While there are no specialized anti-organized-crime units in the judiciary, the courts are prone to corruption and manipulation by criminal groups, drug cartels and politicians. Furthermore, the state of the penitentiary system is very poor, with severe overcrowding and inhumane conditions persisting, including the lack of fresh water. All this contributes to prisons becoming breeding grounds for crime organizations and fuelling corruption. Nicaragua\u2019s navy has been described as effective with regards to drug seizures, while the country\u2019s police force has a less positive reputation. Members of the police have been accused of working alongside paramilitary groups to commit arbitrary arrests, torture and extrajudicial killings, although some argue that the police were successful in reducing levels of violence in poorer urban neighbourhoods through running drug-awareness and -prevention programmes. As with the most other countries in the region, drug traffickers benefit from Nicaragua\u2019s strategic location, extensive coastline and corrupt officials to move drugs through the country.","text - economic and financial environment":"Nicaragua is believed to have one of the highest risks of money laundering and terrorist financing in the world and has been on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list since February 2020. Efforts to tackle these crimes, including through the country\u2019s regulatory framework, seemingly only target people who are seen as opposed to the government, while high-profile figures have only been investigated for these crimes abroad. In addition, although Nicaragua\u2019s anti-corruption legislation is robust on paper, covering bribery, abuse of office and gifts to public officials, among others, it is not enforced effectively. Thus, rampant corruption within the country\u2019s political elites is a major impediment to the functioning of state institutions. This also creates a challenging business environment for foreign companies, which might explain the fact that many companies have left the country in recent years, contributing to increased unemployment and poverty.","text - civil society and social protection":"Even though the government developed a National Strategy for the Comprehensive Attention to Victims of Trafficking in Persons, it does not seem to be offering much real support in practice. Notably, there are very few, if any, human-trafficking investigations that lead to prosecutions, very few victims of trafficking are identified by the state, access to support is all but impossible and there is little to no cooperation on the part of the state with civil society on the issue of human trafficking. Although an agreement is purportedly in place between the government and several thousand businesses to monitor and report child sexual exploitation in the tourism sector, in practice no activity has been carried out. Nicaragua is, however, believed to be implementing some programmes aimed at reducing drug demand, including in areas such as prevention, treatment and social integration. ##&& Although press freedom is guaranteed by the country\u2019s constitution, the government has sought to limit it through various administrative and judicial mechanisms. The vast majority of media outlets are owned and controlled by the government or its allies, and media freedom is restricted through the persecution of journalists, the abuse of libel and defamation laws and judicial harassment. The persecution of social activists and people seen as political opponents is severe, with scores reporting attacks, torture and unfair imprisonment, and a number of iconic human-rights organisations have lost their legal status, which has led to many leaving the country out of fear.","Number of pages":"3","Capital":"Managua","GDP (current $US million)":"12520.92","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"6545502","Land Area (sq. km)":"130370","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"77.1","Freedom in the World Index":"30","Human Development Index":"0.66","Global Peace Index":"2.55","Democracy Index":"3.60","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"22","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1913","1":"6.07","1.1":"5.50","1.2":"6.63","2":"2.46"},{"Corresp":"134","ISO-3":"PAN","Country":"Panama","ISO-2":"PA","Continent":"Americas","Region":"Central America","Flag file":"pa.png","1.

Most trafficking victims are sexually exploited or forced to work in abusive conditions, primarily in the construction sector, although the country has made some progress in tackling child exploitation. Organizations behind human trafficking are known to work in collusion with law enforcement, with police officers accused of extorting victims of sexual exploitation, taking advantage of the fact that the decriminalization of sex work in Panama has blurred the line between legal and illegal activities and that authorities tend to overlook these types of abuses. ##&& Panama is also a transit country for human smuggling, with crime organizations taking advantage of the country\u2019s strategic location, including the Darien Gap, a lawless swathe of jungle on the border with Colombia. Smuggling rings transport migrants from countries such as Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, Ecuador, Pakistan, Ghana, Ethiopia, India and Bangladesh to the United States, with the help of corrupt police officers and other officials.","text - trade":"Panama\u2019s status as a free port and its strategic location have made it the main point of entry for illicit firearms from the United States and central America in transit to South America, particularly Colombia. The country\u2019s ban on arms imports, which was in force between 2011 and 2019, is believed to have helped the development of a black market controlled by high-ranking government officials from the security sector. Although the market is allegedly of a considerable size, most of the weapons only transit Panama to reach their destinations. Notably, the said ban was not renewed in 2020, which is quite likely to lead to a decrease in the cost of arms locally, their increased availability and a potential rise in local violence.","text - environment":"Illegal logging and the trafficking of wood, particularly cocobolo, which is highly valuable in the United States, Europe and China, are the main flora crimes taking place in Panama.These are arguably on the rise, with the increased intensity fuelled by corruption and illegal concessions of protected areas. The illicit traffic of animals, both within the country and internationally, is also a concern in Panama. Species including turtles, monkeys, exotic birds, frogs, reptiles, deer and jaguars are particularly affected by the illegal market that continues to grow despite official efforts to increase public awareness. ##&& Furthermore, Panama is a destination and transit point for minerals, particularly illegal gold coming from Colombia, since the financers of illegal mining tend to set up base in the country as a result of its lax tax laws. Additionally, there is considerable local demand in Panama for luxury items made of minerals, which also contributes to the illegal market. Other minerals such as mercury mined in Mexico tend to be transported through Guatemalan ports to Panama. Mercury in particular is then smuggled into Colombia and Venezuela, where it is used in gold mining.","text - drugs":"Panama\u2019s strategic location connecting North and South America has historically made the country a key transit and storage point for the vast majority of drugs and contraband travelling from Colombia to the United States.The country\u2019s lax financial regulations and strong bank-secrecy laws have in turn contributed to Panama becoming a tax haven for criminals and an attractive base for their logistics and financial operations. Cocaine trafficking, involving transnational organizations aided by local groups and state-embedded actors, is the largest criminal market in Panama and poses a significant security risk in the country. Cannabis is the second-largest drug market in Panama, with the country being a transit and storage point for the drug, which is usually trafficked alongside cocaine. Cannabis is also cultivated locally in remote regions of the country and it is the main criminal activity of some local gangs. Groups that engage in cannabis cultivation are looking to meet limited local demand. Domestic heroin and synthetic drug markets are limited. Nevertheless, it is very likely that Panama is also a transit point for synthetic drugs, such as Ecstasy, ketamine and new psychoactive substances.","text - criminal actors":"Hundreds of mafia-style crime organizations operate across Panama, with the two most prominent groups being Bagdad and CalorCalor. These two are reportedly made up of smaller youth gangs andhave hundreds of members. These groups are mainly involved in drug logistics and guarding shipments, contract killings, kidnapping, extortion and controlling territory for the movement and sale of drugs. Bagdad controls the vast majority of the drug salesin Panama, while CalorCalor focuses on transporting drugs for more sophisticated criminal organizations, particularly from Colombia and Mexico. Both groups have strong territorial control, particularly in strategic areas such as Col\u00f3n, home to the Col\u00f3n Free Trade Zone, the second-largest free-trade zone in the world, and within the country\u2019s prison system, from which their leaders operate. Panama also has a serious corruption issue, although it remains under the radar as a result of an apparent unwillingness of authorities to investigate and prosecute offenders. Arguably, however, local political figures, as well as members of the country\u2019s security forces, are involved in corruption as well as drug trafficking, among other types of criminal offences. Notably, port officers (hired by private companies) are accused of aiding drug cartels to conceal drugs in containers and ships. ##&& In addition, loose criminal networks specialize in money laundering, which is one of the most important criminal markets in the country. In general, criminal networks in Panama use low levels of violence since most of them commit white-collar crimes. Along with loose networks, a number of foreign actors are involved in Panama\u2019s illicit markets, particularly drug trafficking. Mexican groups, including the Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas, and Colombian crime groups, known as BACRIM, were identified as operating in the country.The 57th Front of the now largely demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) was known to be a key actorindrug trafficking in the Darien Gapbut, since its demobilization, the Urabe\u00f1os seem to have taken over. ","text - leadership and governance":"Panama is home to weak political institutions and lacks effective mechanisms to tackle corruption and money laundering, most demonstratively illustrated by the Panama Papers and Odebrecht cases, and compounded by the lack of an independent institution devoted to tackling these illegal markets. In spite of that and the decline in the public\u2019s trust in institutions, the country is considered to berelatively stable. ##&& Internationally, Panama has signed and ratified a number of conventions and treaties to counter drug trafficking and organized crime more generally.The country also has cooperation agreements with a range of partner states, most notably the United States, an important ally in the fight against money laundering. In addition, although Panama has a number of laws targeting organized crime, their scope seems rather broad and, in certain cases, such as environmental crimes, the penalties provided are very low. Financial regulations aimed at curbing money laundering and tax evasion are still considered lax, as are regulations on curbing the establishment of facade companies.","text - criminal justice and security":"Panama\u2019s judiciary faces several challenges when it comes to investigating and prosecuting complex financial crimes, particularly the lack of resources and the fact that cases are never taken as part of wider patterns. The country\u2019s prison system is in crisis, with overcrowded jails housing a large number of individuals on pre-trial detention managed by corrupt officials who fail to tackle violence arising from confrontations among rival gangs. The institutions in charge of security \u2013 the National Police and the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office \u2013 are also regarded as inefficient, mainly as a result of a lack of resources as well as corruption. Meanwhile, Panama\u2019s strategic geographic location has turned the country into one of the main transit points for drug shipments travelling from South America to central America and the US, a warehouse for drugs and a meeting point for criminals. While the state has good reach across the country, control of the Darien Gap between Panama and Colombia has been especially challenging.","text - economic and financial environment":"Panama is an international hub for money laundering, with heads of government, political leaders, and personalities in finance, business, sports and the arts accused of using the country\u2019s lax regulations to conceal corporate property, assets and profits and to evade tax. Despite some advances, legislation is insufficient to tackle this market. Bank-secrecy laws continue to protect anonymous companies and prevention and investigation frameworks, as well as financial intelligence-gathering, remain weak.

The market is led by independent criminals with ties to networks in other Latin American countries and Europe. Trafficked women are also often used to smuggle drugs into Europe and Africa. Internal trafficking, although accounting for only a small proportion of all trafficking cases, is nevertheless problematic. Child labour where marginalized families send their children to work for wealthier households, is a widespread practice in the country and one of the most visible and common forms of human trafficking. ##&& Paraguay is also a transit country for human smuggling, particularly due to the largely unregulated borders it shares with Brazil and Argentina as well as the state-embedded criminal actors that facilitate the criminal market. Most recently, the country has become a transit point for Venezuelans seeking to enter Chile and Argentina, although border closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are believed to have had an impact on these dynamics.","text - trade":"Contraband in legal and illegal products is one of Paraguay\u2019s largest criminal economies. The country\u2019s illicit arms trade remains among the largest in the world, as a result of lax import laws, widespread corruption at various levels of the government, the private sector and the military, the lack of an appropriate records system and the influence of powerful criminal organizations, predominantly from Brazil. Considerable black markets for weapons in neighbouring countries has allowed Paraguay\u2019s role as a transit country in the arms-trafficking market to expand significantly. As Paraguay does not manufacture weapons, a significant number of the weapons that ended up on the grey market before 2018 had been legally imported from the US through legitimate companies, some of which had also been deeply involved in the illegal trade. In 2018, however, the US put a hold on the export of weapons to Paraguay and local authorities announced the creation of a registry, although the impact of these measures is yet to be fully assessed.","text - environment":"Paraguay\u2019s flora crimes market, largely centred on wood trafficking, is expanding. Brazilian crime groups benefit from the largest profits, including by directly financing logging operations in Paraguay, and independent criminal structures operate with the help of corrupt officials, who turn a blind eye to these crimes, accepting bribes and providing documents to facilitate the movement of illicit products. Fauna crimes, although largely led by low-scale criminal networks, have a significant impact. The actors involved commercialize birds and other endangered animals such as monkeys, using social media applications or informal selling points in cities\u2019 central markets, again with the support of corrupt officials. There are also some cases of endangered animals being illegally exported to other countries. Finally, Paraguay\u2019s expanding gold-mining industry suggests the value and impact of illicit trade in this precious metal could also be high.","text - drugs":"Cannabis remains the most important criminal economy in Paraguay, which is the main producer of marijuana in the region. The market is run by local elites with the support of state actors at all levels, although foreign mafia-style structures, such as the First Capital Command (PCC) and Red Command (CV) from Brazil, have also expanded their control in this area, with reports of indigenous communities renting land to them to grow the illegal crop. Authorities reported an increase in marijuana crop-eradication and seizures over recent years and, without a considerable domestic consumption market, most of it is exported to neighbouring countries in South America, including Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay. ##&& Paraguay is also a transit country for cocaine: airstrips are found in most departments and the tri-border area the country shares with Brazil and Argentina is a key point for cocaine destined for local and transatlantic markets. Furthermore, the increase in seizures of coca paste and record amounts of hydrochloric acid and acetone \u2013 chemicals linked to cocaine hydrochloride crystallization \u2013 indicates a growth in cocaine processing, although there are no records of coca plantations in the country. This is also particularly linked to the increased presence of powerful Brazilian crime groups and, to a lesser extent, Colombian cocaine-trafficking networks. Lastly, while heroin does not appear to be either consumed or trafficked through Paraguay, synthetic drugs are gaining ground with local consumers, with evidence of some production within the country. Paraguay also serves as a transit point for Ecstasy and other synthetic drugs originating from European countries and destined for the large markets in Brazil and Argentina.","text - criminal actors":"A number of mafia-style groups operate in Paraguay, with several having developed within the country\u2019s abusive and violent prison system. One of the most powerful groups is the Clan Rotela, a family-based organization that controls a significant percentage of the drug trade in the country and has a strong presence in most of the country\u2019s departments. The Paraguayan People\u2019s Party (EPP), a guerrilla movement that was believed to have fewer than thirty members and little financial and military capacity, has in recent years managed to carry out some impactful operations, including the kidnapping of a former vice president. Furthermore, a number of foreign criminal actors operate across Paraguay. The PCC and the CV from Brazil are among the most powerful foreign actors in Paraguay, operating extensively across the country in criminal markets including the cocaine, marijuana and arms trades, and have recently become involved in cigarette contraband. Moreover, mafia-like organizations from China, which are involved in criminal economies such as people-trafficking and -smuggling and money laundering, and Hezbollah-linked actors are reported to operate in Paraguay. ##&& Criminal networks that focus on illicit markets such as goods smuggling and contraband, including clothes, electronics, cigarettes and fuel, are also very active in Paraguay, particularly in the tri-border area, and are believed to operate with the knowledge or participation of high-profile government officials. There is extensive evidence of state participation in all aspects of the functioning of all criminal markets. Low-level security officials from the police, military and the penitentiary system are known to facilitate criminal activities. Mid-level officials, including local police and penitentiary directors, have been prosecuted for corruption and facilitating criminal activity. Moreover, elite-level officials such as ministers, members of Congress and even presidents have facilitated criminal activity, and at times have taken a more direct role in illicit operations.","text - leadership and governance":"Political leadership and governance are major issues of concern in Paraguay, with state officials at all levels actively participating in all criminal markets, including contraband and drug trafficking. While the country is party to both the UN Convention against Corruption and the Inter-American Convention against Corruption, corruption remains widespread in Paraguay, with scandals involving high-level officials from the Executive and the Treasury, among others. In an effort to adapt to international standards after a decade of pressure by civil society, Paraguay passed a Transparency Law in 2015 and is in an ongoing process to improve access to public information such as budgets, contracts and foreign aid. Furthermore, in 2019, a new Public Contracts Law to improve accountability and make the bidding process more effective and transparent was signed. Despite improvements in recent years, the legal framework pertaining to access to information in the country remains weak. Although accountability in relation to election financing is set in law, no monitoring mechanisms to reduce the risk of financing political campaigns with criminal assets have been developed. ##&& Paraguay is a party to all relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime and has signed a number of cooperation agreements with neighbouring countries, including Argentina and Brazil to fight organized crime in the tri-border region. In addition, the Paraguayan government\u2019s arms-import ban came in the context of cooperation between Brazil and the US to reduce illicit arms imports. Since 2019, the government has expanded its anti-drug-trafficking cooperation with Argentina and has signed an agreement with both Argentina and Brazil, forming the Nueva Alianza Siglo XIX to fight organized crime in the tri-border region. Despite having extradition treaties with almost every country in the Americas, Paraguay has failed to comply with a high-profile extradition request against a former president. Although a number of anti-organized crime laws exist, they are not properly implemented as a result of the poor political leadership and governance in the country.","text - criminal justice and security":"Paraguay has passed a number of laws to tackle organized crime, drugs- and arms-trafficking and money laundering, with Congress considering a series of bills aimed at further fighting money laundering as well as other initiatives such as the creation of specialized units to investigate organized-crime-related activities and a project to expand the military\u2019s capacity to tackle these organizations. The laws, however, are not effectively implemented, mainly due to the country\u2019s weak institutions and a judiciary that lacks resources and coordination among its departments and is deeply corrupt, which has allowed state actors to operate with impunity. In addition, corruption within the country\u2019s law-enforcement agencies, which are allegedly engaged in drug trafficking, cigarette smuggling and illegal lodging among others, has greatly compromised the effectiveness of government strategies and security operations in both rural and urban areas, while Paraguay\u2019s overcrowded and abusive prisons have facilitated the development of crime organizations. ##&& Issues around territorial integrity are at the core of many of Paraguay\u2019s organized-crime challenges, with authorities struggling to control vast areas of the country that have a strong criminal presence. Also, the country\u2019s extensive and porous borders are used by foreign and national criminal organizations to transit in and out of Paraguay, activities that are also facilitated by corrupt customs authorities and other officials. Finally, although recent international cooperation agreements are expected to increase the government\u2019s capacities, it is still too early to assess whether access to better intelligence and equipment will translate into security improvements beyond seizure, eradication and arrest operations.","text - economic and financial environment":"Paraguay is assessed as having one of the highest risks of money laundering and terrorist financing in the region, with criminal operators using legitimate businesses such as casinos, wheel service centres and money-exchange houses as fronts for money laundering and other illegal activities, including drug trafficking and arms trafficking. Nevertheless, the government has made positive steps in recent years. In 2019, the country\u2019s financial intelligence unit approved a new set of regulations that target money-laundering, among others, focussed primarily on improving risk-management systems for banks, financial institutions and insurance companies, which bring Paraguay further in line with international standards. Furthermore, the historic fine imposed by Paraguayan authorities on a Brazilian bank in 2020 for failure to comply with anti-money-laundering regulations suggests some progress and increased political will to tackle money laundering and illicit financial flows. ##&& Despite some advances, mainly by agencies in charge of economic regulatory measures, the changes made have not yet been effective in improving Paraguay\u2019s economic regulatory capacity. Deep-seated corruption is part of the reason for this, with a catalogue of high-profile scandals involving officials, including those in charge of the anti-money-laundering agency, ministers and even presidents. Doing business in Paraguay is reportedly difficult due to low access to credit, weak protections, heightened tax and tax-related administrative burdens. Informality is a common feature in the country\u2019s labour market, which disproportionately affects workers in rural areas of Paraguay, but levels of informality are slowly declining.","text - civil society and social protection":"While Paraguay has a witness protection law, it has faced severe challenges in implementation, particularly around cases involving criminal organizations.

The majority of victims are Peruvian nationals trafficked abroad and foreign citizens, particularly from Venezuela and Colombia, trafficked to the country with false employment offers. Human trafficking, including in the form of labour exploitation, also takes place around illegal mining operations, because the areas tend to be isolated and lack government presence. The market is led by local crime organizations working in collusion with corrupt government officials and, in some cases, in partnership with foreign actors. ##&& Peru is also a transit point for human smuggling, including migrants from Haiti and Senegal travelling to Brazil and people from the Dominican Republic trying to reach Chile. The influx of Venezuelan migrants, which had been rising in recent years, has dwindled since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Smuggling is largely carried out by individuals linked to land transport companies.","text - trade":"Peru is a transit point for illegal weapons from the US and Mexico to Colombia, and the market is closely linked to drug production and trade. The country is also home to a grey market in small firearms, ammunition and projectiles, mostly stolen or bought from corrupt law enforcement. This illicit market is also the source of weapons for terrorist groups operating in the country.","text - environment":"A very substantial portion of Peru\u2019s timber trade is illegal and accounts for much of the country\u2019s flora-crimes market, with both illegally harvested local wood and timber from Colombia, Brazil and Ecuador sent to the Amazon region for transport to countries including Mexico and the United States. Rising official corruption and the lack of effective controls, regulations and government capacity to enforce laws facilitate this illegal market. Fauna trafficking is also substantial in Peru, with most species meeting both local and foreign demand, and the market controlled by a mix of national and international crime networks aided by lenient policies. Trafficked species include birds such as the white-winged parakeet and green macaw, which are sold as pets; larger animals such as Andean bears, vicu\u00f1as, monkeys and various cats, which are sold for meat; and other species, including reptiles and amphibians sold for medicinal purposes or to the fashion industry. Furthermore, there is considerable illegal fishing. ##&& As the top gold producer in the region, illegal gold mining is a key criminal market in Peru, particularly in the regions bordering Brazil, Bolivia and Ecuador, with exports mainly flowing in the direction of the United States and Europe. The illegal gold-mining sector is controlled by a mix of local miners, middlemen, powerful family-based networks, foreign armed groups, and politicians.","text - drugs":"Authorities have reported the existence of some poppy plantations in remote areas of Peru, with opium mainly exported to Ecuador and Colombia for conversion into heroin. The local heroin market is very limited. Conversely, Peru is the second-largest producer of cocaine in the world, with local family clans managing logistics, working alongside Serbian, Mexican and Colombian mafias, and aided by corrupt officials, mainly to serve the international trade as domestic consumption is very limited. Some of the main routes go through Mexico for the US market and Brazil for the European market, with some shipments sent directly to Oceania and Japan. Authorities allow for the controlled cultivation of coca leaves in some areas of the country and, while they are making efforts to manually eradicate illegal coca plantations, they do not seem to be tackling the extent of the market. ##&& Regarding cannabis, the cultivation, transport and sale of medicinal marijuana is legal in the country, and small criminal networks serve the local illegal market. The government is also focusing on eradicating illegal crops across the country. Peru is a transit point for synthetic drugs, with the market run by loose criminal networks and the product destined mainly for Chile as well as a small local consumption market.","text - criminal actors":"Crime organizations in Peru tend to be relatively small, operate locally and sit somewhere between mafia-style groups and criminal networks, with the most active being Shining Path, an armed organization with significant access to weapons and linked to drug trafficking and other criminal activities. Other similar organizations tend to specialize in specific criminal markets, such as timber and drug trafficking, and have a strong presence and control in criminally strategic areas with limited government reach. The country is also home to loose criminal networks that control specific markets in coordination with hired individuals and powerful international groups. ##&& Crime organizations are deeply embedded in Peruvian institutions, with scores of officials, including members of law-enforcement agencies, parliamentarians and even judges, under investigation for providing security for the transport of illicit goods or protection of criminals. Furthermore, a number of prominent international crime groups operate in Peru, with Colombian and Mexican mafias historically controlling the cocaine-trafficking market and actors from countries including Brazil, Ecuador, Venezuela, Serbia and Italy involved in an array of criminal activities. ","text - leadership and governance":"Peru suffers high levels of corruption, reaching the highest levels of government and seriously affecting governance. This is reflected in the ongoing changes in the executive branch over the last two years, with several presidents having faced charges related to the administration of state contracts, bribery and money laundering, and either under investigation, behind bars or on the run from justice. Authorities at the regional level, including provincial mayors, have also been accused of crimes including collusion with drug traffickers and illegal loggers. Although, on paper, good public policies and a budget increase to strengthen law-enforcement and judicial capacity would seem to reflect an official interest in tackling organized crime, corruption is still a major concern. ##&& The country appears to have a relatively robust legal framework to tackle organized crime, including asset seizure, although not covering illegal wildlife trade. Peru has signed the majority of relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime and has extradition agreements with a number of countries in the region. Although these have been tested in several high-level cases, some of the other laws are not as effectively implemented and the judiciary seems to be overly focused on high-level cases alone.","text - criminal justice and security":"Peru\u2019s judiciary is made up of a network of courts, including one specialized in organized crime and corruption at the hands of government officials. While the Peruvian judicial system has been relatively successful in dealing with high-level cases, it has been rather slow and ineffective when dealing with lower-profile ones. Law-enforcement agencies also have bodies specialized in complex crimes, as does the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which has had some success, particularly in cases involving top government officials. The prison system suffers from some of the challenges that are common to the rest of the region, with overcrowding being one main issue. ##&& Territorially, Peru\u2019s suitability for coca leaf cultivation and vast ungoverned areas make the country a strategic hub for the international cocaine trade, enabling a criminal landscape to develop and flourish. Its location bordering Brazil\u2019s large domestic market and international routes also make it a particularly useful location for crime organizations.","text - economic and financial environment":"Peru has made important improvements over recent years when it comes to the institutions, laws, cooperation, credibility of operators and others related to the fight against money laundering, including the establishment of a national plan to tackle it. The country\u2019s financial intelligence unit is also reported to have frozen millions of dollars in suspicious funds. Despite this, such funds continue to flow through local banks and the country is still believed to be at high risk for money laundering and terrorism financing. The activities of crime groups, particularly in the north of the country, have helped the local economy grow but also opened the door for crimes including extortion to develop, which make many areas of the country not particularly friendly for business.","text - civil society and social protection":"Over recent years, authorities in Peru have increased their efforts to identify and protect victims of human trafficking, including the provision of assistance to victims and protection to witnesses through national legislation and a network of shelters. However, issues still persist, particularly when it comes to resource availability. Peru is also home to vibrant civil society organizations, although, in some areas, the lack of protection has put the lives of many activists, particularly those working to protect the environment, at very high risk. Furthermore, despite the existence of a wide range of independent investigative outlets, journalists who cover social or environmental conflicts, expose cases of corruption or investigate drug traffickers' influence on state institutions, risk legal dissuasion or harsher crackdowns.","Number of pages":"3","Capital":"Lima","GDP (current $US million)":"226848.05","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"32510453","Land Area (sq. km)":"1285220","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"71.4","Freedom in the World Index":"71","Human Development Index":"0.78","Global Peace Index":"2.07","Democracy Index":"6.53","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"38","GDP per capita (current US$)":"6978","1":"6.35","1.1":"6.20","1.2":"6.50","2":"4.58"},{"Corresp":"162","ISO-3":"KNA","Country":"St. Kitts and Nevis","ISO-2":"KN","Continent":"Americas","Region":"Caribbean","Flag file":"kn.png","1.

In addition, some foreign nationals who choose St. Kitts and Nevis as a holiday or residential destination are involved in drug trafficking, with Venezuelans known to be overseeing cocaine shipments.","text - leadership and governance":"Although authorities in St. Kitts and Nevis have been somewhat successful in curbing violence, the use of the country as a safe haven for money laundering is still considered a considerable challenge to governance, particularly due to the country\u2019s strong bank-secrecy laws and lack of transparency when it comes to legal entities. In addition, the country\u2019s Citizen by Investment Programme, which allows travel to 140 countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union, without a visa, is believed to facilitate systematic corruption and fraud. Nevertheless, St. Kitts and Nevis has a set of anti-corruption laws in place, which for the most part appear to be enforced adequately. Assessments also point to fair transparency in governance. Although legislation on freedom of information has been passed rather recently in the country, in 2018, it is still to be institutionalized. ##&& St. Kitts and Nevis has signed and ratified a number of international treaties pertaining to organized crime. The country is also open to international cooperation, as illustrated by the programmes currently in place, funded by the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union, to improve law-enforcement and intelligence-gathering and -analysis capacities. National laws also cover crimes related to organized crime, although many pieces of legislation need revising.","text - criminal justice and security":"St. Kitts and Nevis\u2019s justice system seems to be independent and not affected by high levels of corruption, although investigations and successful prosecutions against organized crime groups are still rare. The penitentiary system, however, suffers a number of challenges, including overcrowding, mainly due to high numbers of inmates in pre-trial detention. Although St. Kitts and Nevis has no anti-organized-crime unit, with the exception of one for narcotics, the police boast good levels of public trust. Nevertheless, there are indications of law enforcement in the country being influenced by the political class.

Despite the laws and procedures in place, not a single charge related to money laundering has been brought up in the country since 2015. The country is also vulnerable to money laundering because of the lack of transparency regarding the beneficial ownership of legal entities and its strict secrecy laws. Thus, the overall risk of money laundering is very high. In addition, doing business in St. Kitts and Nevis is considered to be very difficult due to challenges in registering property, low access to credit and high taxes.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim and witness protection in St. Kitts and Nevis is minimal, although these are both considered essential due to the relatively high number of murders of witnesses. The country has, however, several prevention programmes aimed at tackling the root causes of crime, including the social environment in which the perpetrators live, which have yielded positive results in reducing the homicide rate over time. Civil society organizations also play a key role in crime prevention, particularly in areas including human trafficking, drug consumption, arms trading and law-enforcement training. Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, the state owns the only television channel in the country and the opposition is said to face some restrictions to its access.

Nevertheless, it often sees people being forced into sexual and labour exploitation. Victims are both St. Lucia nationals as well as regular and irregular migrants from other Caribbean nations (Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic) as well as Guyana and South Asia. In addition, foreign women working in strip clubs are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Local children, especially those of economically disadvantaged families, are particularly vulnerable to victimization in sex trafficking. They are often encouraged or forced by parents and caretakers to enter exploitation. Reportedly, women or older teenagers are active in recruiting younger adolescents and the perpetrators are often entrepreneurs from St. Lucia, India, China, Cuba and Russia. ##&& Given that it is accepted that sex workers travel to St. Lucia from poorer neighbouring island and other regions, there may be an element of smuggling, albeit on a small scale.","text - trade":"St. Lucia's proximity to Martinique ensures that strong illicit trade routes are established between the two. These routes are well documented as part of the cocaine trade and suspected as facilitating arms trafficking as well. Allegedly, Venezuelan drug networks smuggle firearms into St. Lucia along with cocaine. The weapons are then used by local crime groups to secure their drug stockpiles. Alternatively, illegal arms shipments coming into St. Lucia from the US are exported to Martinique for onward transportation to mainland France.","text - environment":"While an illicit market for orchids that are exported to France does exist, it does not appear to be a significant one. Similarly, there are indications to suggest that either fauna or non-renewable resources crimes markets exist in St. Lucia.","text - drugs":"There is no evidence to suggest that an illicit heroin market exists, as there are no reported cases of heroin use or instances of seized heroin shipments coming into or through St. Lucia. The country is a key Caribbean transit hub for cocaine shipments bound mainly for the US, Europe or Canada. Crucial to St. Lucia's role in the cocaine trade is its proximity to Martinique (France), which has drawn Venezuelan crime groups. The latter usually deliver cocaine via fishing boats and offload the drugs at sea off the west coast of St. Lucia. Other groups may prefer offshore airdrops, but in both cases, local traffickers collect the goods in small boats and stockpile them along the island's coastline. Such shipments have recently decreased in frequency, but increased in quantity. Subsequently, cocaine is trafficked to Martinique or loaded on yachts destined directly for Europe. Notably, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Venezuelan cocaine traffickers have favoured St. Vincent and the Grenadines, displacing cocaine flows to these locations, likely in an effort to avoid interception. This is expected to be temporary throughout the pandemic. Cocaine is consumed locally, but its prevalence is not large and is arguably a by-product of cocaine transiting through the country, as is violence and murder. ##&& Cannabis is produced and consumed on the island and is therefore a highly prevalent narcotic. In addition, cannabis smuggled from St. Vincent and the Grenadines on fishing vessels or inter-island freight vessels moves through St. Lucian territorial waters as well. With a third of the homicides in the country being drug-related, it is likely that the cannabis market contributes to that at least in part. Reports have noted sporadic seizures of Ecstasy coming from the UK in St. Lucia, but domestic use is likely very limited.","text - criminal actors":"Mafia-style groups appear to be the most prevalent criminal actor type in St. Lucia. While international traffickers control drug routes, local gangs often provide services such as security and transport, for which they are paid in cash, arms or drugs. The latter feed domestic demand and contribute to increasing competition between different entities, which leads to violence, including homicide. Besides drug distribution, gangs are involved in robberies and extortion, and operate primarily in Castries, Gros Islet and Vieux Fort. Less organized gangs resembling criminal networks also feature heavily in the country. Similar to mafia-style structures in St. Lucia, criminal networks also engage in the drug trade, providing assistance to foreign traffickers. ##&& Although there are strong indications that corrupt officials facilitate criminal operations (including, for example some customs officers at the Castries port allegedly facilitating the import of cocaine and firearms on a semi-regular basis), there is no evidence of state-embedded actors working with crime organizations. St. Lucia is a transit country for drug trafficking, and as already emphasized, foreign actors control the drug routes, but collaborate with local criminal networks.","text - leadership and governance":"The government holds a firm stance on serious crime, evident in the country\u2019s development plan, spanning 2019\u20132022 as well as in the anti-gang legislation, passed in 2014. The democratic process is independent and protected from criminal influence, although corruption and inadequate transparency are recognized as problematic. International observers report corruption perceptions in St. Lucia to be low to moderate, in spite of allegations of corruption against some high-profile political figures in the country. Several national bodies are tasked with anti-corruption, however, they are somewhat constrained due to inadequate funding. ##&& St. Lucia is party to a number of international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime and corruption. The country cooperates effectively with partners, albeit mainly on areas related to drug trafficking, including through membership in the Regional Security System. St. Lucia has a fairly strong and up-to-date legal framework, influenced by the UK legal system. St. Lucia\u2019s legislation focuses mostly on drug trafficking and gang-related activity, but although there are anti-corruption laws in place, the latter are rarely enforced.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judiciary is generally independent and corruption in the judicial system has not been identified as a major obstacle. The right to a fair trial in St. Lucia is also guaranteed but the legal system is notorious for its slow delivery of justice, which results in a growing backlog of cases and long stays of pre-trial detention. The prison system is also under pressure, with overcrowding reportedly being an issue. In spite of some instances of guards abusing inmates, the country's only prison meets international prison standards. The Royal St. Lucia Police Force (RSLPF) is the main agency responsible for maintaining law and order in the country. The force, unlike St. Lucia's customs, enjoys high levels of public trust, although police brutality and excessive use of force have damaged its reputation in recent years. Additionally, reports of a degree of political influence over law enforcement also persist. There are two specialized units within the RSLPF \u2013 the Drug Squad and the Marine Unit, which, along with Customs and Ports Police are responsible for curbing trafficking flows to and through St. Lucia. Allegedly, however, law enforcement agencies were under-resourced and lacked enough officers to keep up with the caseload. Additionally, the country faces the threat of porous borders and lack of intelligence, which prove to be the main issues related to the country's territorial integrity. St. Lucia's vulnerability to trafficking flows is all the more apparent in the country's proximity to Martinique \u2013 a direct path for drugs to Europe.","text - economic and financial environment":"St. Lucia is for the most part in technical compliance with international anti-money laundering (AML) standards. The country has also made some progress in strengthening its AML regime and has an operational financial intelligence unit that is responsible for money laundering prevention. Nevertheless, the risk of money laundering is present. Money laundering that takes place in the country is mostly related to the drugs trade and the profits generated by domestic and foreign criminals. It is also alleged that financial institutions in the country are inadvertently involved in currency transactions that move proceeds from the international drug trade. St. Lucia has in place adequate policies and laws to promote fair competition, while setting a clear framework for both foreign and domestic investors. Thus, the economic regulatory environment is conducive to doing business, which is why St. Lucia has managed to draw foreign direct investment in a number of economic sectors, including offshore banking, transhipment and tourism.","text - civil society and social protection":"There is no official register, operating standards or monitoring system for specialized facilities that provide treatment services for people with problems associated with drug use. Drug-related issues are addressed by the country's primary health care facilities. Support mechanisms for victims of trafficking are not well established either. There is no government shelter to provide assistance to victims, but NGOs shelter victims when need arises. Conversely, the country's anti-human trafficking legislation provides for victim protection when testifying against traffickers. The country also has a dedicated police unit \u2013 the Vulnerable Persons Unit (or Vulnerable Persons Teams), which deals with cases related to domestic violence. Prevention efforts, on the other hand, have been stepped up in recent years. A task force comprised of NGOs and relevant agencies was established and mandated to work on capacity building and awareness raising, particularly targeting vulnerable age groups. Civil society is also involved in interruption work with gang leaders in hotspots, working as intermediaries to reduce retaliation and use of violence. Reportedly, while labour laws are comprehensive enough, enforcing them is an issue, with few trained labour inspectors available to monitor the different sectors. Reportedly, no steps were taken on the part of authorities to reduce the demand for commercial sex. Drug abuse prevention programmes have also been undertaken by the government, targeting key populations. In addition, authorities have offered training on drug abuse prevention, treatment and research to police officers, counsellors, prison guards and other professionals. In general, however, NGO involvement in issues pertaining to organized crime is rather limited. NGOs that focus on crime-related issues tend to work mostly on drug-related issues. Freedom of the press is guaranteed by law and upheld in practice.

St. Vincent and the Grenadines is another waypoint for cocaine coming from South America and bound for Europe, the US and other parts of the Caribbean. The Grenadine islands continue to be a stronghold for Venezuelan crime groups, with cocaine shipments from Venezuela to the Grenadines (and Grenada) increasing at the expense of shipments to St. Lucia, likely due to groups trying to minimize the risk of interception. For the most part, crime groups organize Venezuelan fishing vessels to offload bulk quantities of cocaine in coastal waters. The drugs are then collected and stockpiled for onward loading onto pleasure crafts that are predominantly destined for Europe. The frequency of these smuggling attempts has reportedly reduced in recent years, but the quantities of cocaine trafficked have grown four\/five-fold. The country is also a transhipment point of South American cannabis to the US, Europe and other parts of the Caribbean. This specifically relates to specialist high-grade South American cannabis known as \u2018Creepy\u2019 only. In addition, St. Vincent and the Grenadines maintains cannabis cultivation for traditional, medicinal and religious purposes, which was regulated in 2018. It is also the largest cannabis producer in the Caribbean, after Jamaica.

Domestic networks are also involved in criminal markets. Reportedly, around 200 gangs with loose membership exist in the country. Prior to the 2018 reforms, criminal networks were linked to trafficking of cannabis, but this has changed since then. Currently, networks mainly based on family and cultural connections operating predominately on the Grenadine islands are engaged in human and drug trafficking. ##&& While many gangs operate in the country, very few could be classified as mafia-style structures. High-level corruption in St. Vincent and the Grenadines appears to be very low, if present at all, and there is no evidence to suggest that state-embedded actors are directly involved in criminal markets or organized crime more generally.","text - leadership and governance":"The international community has at times accused St. Vincent and the Grenadines of not doing enough to combat organized crime \u2013 allegations which have been vehemently denied by authorities. Nevertheless, while the government has introduced significant reforms in cannabis legislation and focused on youth policies as well as environmental issues, certain aspects, such as firearm trafficking, remain unaddressed. As emphasized earlier, corruption in the country is low. In terms of transparency, the government is perceived as open and transparent with leadership holding sessions with citizens on matters of concern. Nevertheless, access to information is rather poor as legislation on freedom of information is yet to be fully implemented despite being passed in 2003. Notably, there is no active legal mechanism that requires public officials to declare income, assets or gifts. ##&& St. Vincent and the Grenadines is party to a number of key international conventions and treaties pertaining to organized crime, with the exception of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Nevertheless, the country has ratified the Inter-American Convention against Corruption. The country is open to international cooperation and is currently working towards improving intelligence sharing with counterparts. Furthermore, the country is a member of the Regional Security System, under the framework of which Caribbean partner states work together in the fields of prevention of smuggling, immigration control, fishery protection, pollution control and prevention of threats to national security. In spite of being party to most organized crime-related conventions, St. Vincent and the Grenadines\u2019 legislation on human, drugs and arms trafficking face criticism for not complying with international standards and for allowing inadequate sentencing. In one of the most notable recent developments, the country passed legislation regarding cannabis production and consumption. Overall, however, legislation is adequate in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, compared to the threats the country faces.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judicial system in St. Vincent and the Grenadines builds on UK law but is antiquated and in need of reform. Limited financial resources and institutional weakness put a strain on the system\u2019s capacity, including law enforcement, to effectively counter organized crime. Reportedly, a large percentage of those awaiting trial were gang-related, while the slowness of the judicial process is believed to have allowed some criminals to reoffend whilst on bail awaiting trial. Nevertheless, there have been some improvements. The country managed to secure international funding for maritime intelligence and search units. There is an anti-human trafficking unit as well. Monitoring the country's borders is the responsibility of the Special Services Unit, which is the paramilitary arm of the police force. The task is not an easy one as the geography and topography of St. Vincent and the Grenadines make it vulnerable and its borders difficult to monitor and police. Overall, however, the measures seem adequate and proportionate to the low threat organized crime poses to the country.","text - economic and financial environment":"Substantial efforts have been made on the part of authorities to tackle money laundering. Arguably, the country has a comprehensive anti-money laundering legislation and the risk of money laundering is medium. Conversely, doing business in the country is very difficult, with trade and customs regulations being the biggest constraints to the country's ability to integrate the global market chain.","text - civil society and social protection":"The country has taken criticism for the lack of victim and witness protection programmes, although some improvement was registered in that respect. The government does operate a shelter in collaboration with NGOs to provide financial, social, medical and psychological assistance to victims of trafficking and domestic violence. No such facility exists for male victims. Another development in witness and victim support has been the increased training of law enforcement on human trafficking as well as deepening collaboration with international partners on planning operations against child sex trafficking. Additionally, there is legislation to guarantee protection to victims before, during and after a trial. Crime prevention programmes exist in the country, with several developed and implemented with the assistance of civil society and communities to help crime victims and which focus on drug prevention. The government also works on the prevention of human trafficking, with the prime minister being responsible for coordinating the efforts across different government agencies. In addition to that, the national anti-human trafficking action plan was extended to 2020 with some improvements. Importantly, there is a National Commission on Crime Prevention that specifically tackles organized crime related issues. St. Vincent and the Grenadines\u2019 constitution guarantees press freedom, which is generally upheld in practice. While the state owns the primary broadcaster in the country, there are a number of other media outlets functioning in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Nevertheless, journalists remain vulnerable to vaguely worded criminal and civil defamation laws, which stipulate for a significant fine and prison time for those who are found guilty.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Kingstown","GDP (current $US million)":"824.72","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"110589","Land Area (sq. km)":"390","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"","Freedom in the World Index":"91","Human Development Index":"0.74","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"","Regime Type":"","Corruption Perceptions Index":"59","GDP per capita (current US$)":"7458","1":"3.30","1.1":"2.85","1.2":"3.75","2":"5.46"},{"Corresp":"166","ISO-3":"SUR","Country":"Suriname","ISO-2":"SR","Continent":"Americas","Region":"South America","Flag file":"sr.png","1.

The increasing influx of irregular migrants, especially from the Caribbean and Brazil\u2019s poor northern regions, Haiti and Venezuela, yields a steady supply of potential victims. The latter are mostly recruited in clubs in the capital, Paramaribo. Once sold to a club owner, victims struggle to pay \u2018debts\u2019 (for example, for food and lodging), and are subjected to forced labour and prostitution \u2013 often in remote parts of the jungle, including in illegal gold-mining camps. Children are also vulnerable to labour trafficking, especially in small-scale gold mines, with some being trafficked to informal mining camps and sexually exploited there. Human-trafficking networks are believed to be international, working through local, small ethnic groups. There have also been reports of Chinese and Hong Kong-based groups trafficking migrant workers to Suriname for forced labour in gold mines, as well as in service-based professions. ##&& The country\u2019s human-smuggling market is often intertwined with the human-trafficking market because irregular migrants are more vulnerable to trafficking. As Chinese investments in Suriname have largely faded and migrant workers have left the country, the human-smuggling channels from Hong Kong and China have dissipated, giving way to Dutch Caribbean criminal actors. There is limited data, however it is believed that officials are facilitating human smuggling.","text - trade":"Suriname is a transit hub for arms trafficking, with the trade mostly being controlled by Brazilian organized groups: Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC) and Comando Vermelho (CV), among others. Reportedly, criminal actors involved in arms trafficking are likely to be part of international networks, relying on local connections and corrupt government officials. Notably, arms smuggling is closely related to drug trafficking, and is likely to be enabled by the same actors, including members of the now former government. Weapons from Venezuela are also known to end up in Suriname through intermediaries involved in cocaine and gold trafficking.","text - environment":"Illicit logging appears to be a significant issue in Suriname. It is largely perpetrated by tribal communities rather than organized-crime groups, and is, for the most part, motivated by poverty. Multinational and medium-sized domestic companies that are not part of organized-crime structures have also been known to fell timber illegally and harvest protected flora species for export to China and Hong Kong. Much of the illicit logging was reportedly controlled by the former government, more specifically the inner circle of former president D\u00e9si Bouterse, who granted concessions to corporations at the expense of indigenous tribes. People are rarely dependent on animals as a source of revenue or food, but they kill them opportunistically because, due to habitat loss, animals are forced to come into contact with humans. Nevertheless, Suriname appears to be a source, destination and transit country for fauna-related crimes, especially jaguar poaching and trading in jaguar parts, but also poaching of songbirds and turtle eggs. Allegedly, international networks (mostly Chinese) work with tribal populations on a kill-to-order basis, or purchase jaguars already killed by locals. In addition, hunters from Brazil and Guyana cross into Suriname to poach jaguars. Suriname is also an entrep\u00f4t for illegal wildlife from the Guianas. ##&& Suriname is mainly a source country for illegally mined gold. In general, there are two types of operations \u2013 informal, small-scale operations often facilitated by state actors, and larger, formal actors that subcontract artisanal miners to work on legal concessions. For the most part, miners are of Brazilian origin, although local tribes are known to participate as well. Moreover, a significant percentage of artisanal gold from nearby countries is trafficked and sold in Suriname, laundered and then exported abroad, mainly because Surinamese traders require no paperwork but also because tax\/royalties in the country are lower than elsewhere. Since 2020, however, foreign currencies in Suriname have been sold at controlled and expensive exchange rates, which has prompted traders to sell gold in Guyana. Violence is not uncommon in the sector, as miners working illegally often clash with workers from larger companies. The environmental effect of illegal gold-mining operations is severe as it leads to deforestation and pollution caused by mercury used in artisanal mining. Importantly, mercury is trafficked from Guyana to Suriname, or in containers with mining equipment, most likely from China. ","text - drugs":"Heroin makes up a small percentage of the drugs consumed in Suriname, which indicates that the domestic market for heroin is small or non-existent. There is no evidence of heroin transiting Suriname either. Conversely, while cocaine use in the country is low, Suriname is among the preferred transit points for cocaine shipped from Latin America to Europe, and allegedly serves as a distribution hub. Although airways are still used, most cocaine is trafficked via maritime routes, going out of the port of Paramaribo. Actors involved in the cocaine trade are believed to be highly organized mafia-style groups, operating as part of larger international networks and involving high levels of government corruption. Most cocaine comes from Brazil, although Colombian actors \u2013 the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) \u2013 are involved as well. In addition, Surinamese groups are alleged to collaborate with counterparts in the Guianas, trafficking drugs to France and the UK. The cocaine trade also has underprivileged local populations from poorer border regions involved, looking for ways to earn a living. ##&& Suriname is a country of origin as well as a key transhipment point for cannabis, which is trafficked to Europe. Estimates point to 80% of domestic cannabis production being smuggled into French Guiana, while the remainder is consumed locally. Notably, although cannabis is illegal, authorities do not generally enforce regulations against its use in public. In a similar fashion, the country is a transit point for MDMA (Ecstasy) produced in the Netherlands and destined for the US, the Dutch Antilles, Aruba and French Guiana. Arguably, however, Suriname is not believed to be a particularly attractive synthetic-drug transit point or to hold a competitive advantage over other Caribbean countries in that respect.","text - criminal actors":"Given the involvement of former president Bouterse and his inner circle in organized crime, their support for terrorism as well as their alleged provision of multiple avenues for the political, economic and military elites to access profits obtained illegally, the degree to which the Surinamese state has patronage and control over criminal markets is assessed as high. Evidence suggests corruption permeates all levels of government, up to the highest echelons of the Bouterse administration before it was replaced in July 2020, allowing gangs to collaborate closely with the state. In addition, the previous administration was, to a large extent, able to exert its criminal influence over the democratic process. It is yet to be determined whether the new administration will be able to change that perception. As a major drug hub, Suriname is a place of convergence for foreign criminal organizations, including those originating in the Guianas, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru and Brazil. While foreign actors do not exert complete control over any criminal markets, they are an important part of the drug and human trades, as well as environmental crime, all of which maintain their presence in Suriname. Among the foreign groups active in Suriname are demobilized FARC elements, the Brazilian PCC and CV groups, as well as the growing Chinese diaspora, members of which are predominately involved in fauna-related crime. The borderlands and the surrounding towns are among the hotspots where such groups are concentrated, as are the port areas of Paramaribo. ##&& Arguably two types of domestic criminal networks operate in Suriname: groups built on connections between smaller groups who collaborate as part of a larger illicit supply chain, and networks characterized by friend-to-friend relations. The former might operate abroad or collaborate with counterparts in Brazil or the Guianas, while the latter smuggle illegal commodities out of Suriname on a small scale in order to sell them. There are not any significant, well-structured mafia-style groups dominating over large areas in Suriname. Insofar as such structures exist, they are small and hierarchical, but controlled by government, military and police leaders.","text - leadership and governance":"Following the decade-long Bouterse rule that was characterized by rampant corruption and state involvement in organized-crime activities, Chan Santokhi took over the presidency in July 2020. While Santokhi helped disrupt cocaine flows and highlighted the importance of tackling corruption, he is likely to face considerable challenges in implementing policy changes. These include entrenched state corruption, limited coalition support, as well as a vice president who is a convicted drug trafficker and a fugitive, wanted by INTERPOL. Evidently, political will to tackle corruption is lacking because the country does not have adequate anti-corruption legislation in place, nor laws that require public officials to disclose their financial state. Although the government publishes its yearly financial plans, access to information in Suriname is poor. ##&& Suriname is party to a number of treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, with the exception of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. The country has made use of significant capacity-building, financial and technical assistance, provided by international partners. Along with regional partners, it participates in counter-narcotics, rule-of-law and anti-corruption, as well as anti-financial-crime and anti-money-laundering initiatives organized by US law enforcement. In spite of that, the country is still not considered a trusted partner in the fight against organized crime because crucial mechanisms against it are lacking. Organized-crime-specific legislation is also missing from the different forms of criminality covered by the penal code. Notably, while cannabis in Suriname remains illegal, police do not generally enforce regulations against its use in public places, and reform is being undertaken towards the drug\u2019s legalization. Overall, Suriname\u2019s legal framework is outdated, largely unenforced and very weak.","text - criminal justice and security":"No significant reforms in the judicial system have occurred in the past two decades either, with the judiciary being designed to protect the Bouterse circle more than anything else. Against this backdrop, the new governing coalition has promised to reform the judiciary and strengthen its independence by, among other things, granting it its own budget, improving prosecution services and appointing special prosecutors to focus on high-level corruption cases. The enormity of the task ahead, with corruption seemingly embedded in every aspect of the country, will make this commitment challenging at best. Although prisons in Suriname are crowded due to a high rate of pre-trial incarceration, and conditions are poor, they are not controlled by criminal organizations and gangs. Law enforcement in Suriname is severely under-resourced, with a general lack of personnel, low salaries, insufficient coordination (including with the armed forces), as well as inadequate training and equipment significantly impeding their ability to undertake operations to curb organized crime. The majority of units are based in Paramaribo, which allows criminal organizations, such as traffickers, to operate undisturbed across the vast jungle that covers most of the country. Importantly, Suriname\u2019s borders are virtually non-existent as the country\u2019s thick jungle covering renders borders almost impossible to protect. Indigenous people who travel by river between villages that now cross countries, including Guyana and Brazil, without the need for identification create further vulnerabilities and provide opportunities for organized-crime groups to exploit.","text - economic and financial environment":"Suriname\u2019s financial intelligence unit works as an independent unit of the justice ministry and cooperates with the financial investigations unit of the country\u2019s police force against money laundering. Established instruments for investigating money laundering exist, but mechanisms to establish transparency in the administration of seized assets are not developed. In addition, Suriname becoming a source of illicit gold and a gold-trafficking transit hub has created opportunities for laundering of criminal proceeds, which have been protected by highly influential people, including state-embedded actors. Moreover, Suriname is among the least free economies in the region, with powerful individuals being able to influence both business and legal processes in the country, thereby undermining rule of law and enabling organized-crime-related activities. In combination with the weak protections and economic regulatory capacity of the state, doing business is difficult. Legitimate businesses are thus vulnerable to government influence and at risk of being infiltrated by organized crime.","text - civil society and social protection":"Notable efforts in victim and witness support include financing an action plan, developing victim-referral mechanisms and providing training to law enforcement. In spite of that, Suriname falls short of meeting its responsibilities to tackle human trafficking and support victims adequately. In terms of prevention, Suriname has strategies covering prevention of drug use, human trafficking, money laundering and corruption. The country is also part of regional initiatives concerning themselves with prevention. Yet, these are yielding little result, as evidenced by the rampant corruption and organized-crime activity in the country. Civil society is strong, but due to their reliance on government approval and funding, only a few NGOs work on organized-crime-related issues. Against this backdrop, the media environment is generally free of political interference, although a harsh defamation law is in effect and some journalists have exercised self-censorship, particularly on issues related to Bouterse and his inner circle.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Paramaribo","GDP (current $US million)":"3697.37","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"581363","Land Area (sq. km)":"163820","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"61.5","Freedom in the World Index":"79","Human Development Index":"0.74","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"6.82","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"38","GDP per capita (current US$)":"6360","1":"4.90","1.1":"4.55","1.2":"5.25","2":"2.25"},{"Corresp":"176","ISO-3":"TTO","Country":"Trinidad and Tobago","ISO-2":"TT","Continent":"Americas","Region":"Caribbean","Flag file":"tt.png","1.

The market is largely driven by local demand and has mostly foreign actors \u2013 Chinese groups and, since recently, Venezuelan nationals \u2013 involved in exploiting victims in private businesses. Along with Trinidadian and Tobagonian, women and girls from Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Guyana and Columbia are vulnerable to sexual exploitation in brothels and clubs in the country. Economic migrants from the Caribbean and Asia are also at risk of exploitation in domestic servitude and\/or forced labour in the retail sector. Additionally, the sheer volume of vessels going through Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s territorial waters increases the risk of forced labour in the fishing industry, and many trafficked boys are coerced into selling drugs. Corruption among police and immigration officials in relation to human trafficking exists, but its extent is unknown. ##&& There is no evidence of a significant human-smuggling market in Trinidad and Tobago. However, due to the current economic and political climate in Venezuela, thousands of Venezuelan citizens have tried to irregularly cross the border into Trinidad and Tobago. Although the country is not always the final destination for Venezuelans, the proximity and porosity of its borders make it a key transit point. Human smuggling routes are often disjointed and form part of other crime networks, including those involving vessels that cross the channel carrying both irregular Venezuelan migrants and contraband. In case irregular migrants are unable to pay smugglers, they may be pushed into forced labour and\/or sexual exploitation.","text - trade":"Trinidad and Tobago is a substantial trafficking destination for the regional arms-trafficking market, with most weapons coming from the US. Notably, the political and economic crisis in Venezuela is believed to have further exacerbated Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s arms-trafficking market. In general, illegal arms are shipped along with drugs and are often used as payment in drug deals. Illegitimate cargo is regularly concealed with the help of corrupt officials. The illicit arms market is also associated with the rising levels of gun violence in Trinidad and Tobago. Due to the evolution of gangs in the country, there has been an increase in gang-on-gang violence using sophisticated, fully automatic high-powered firearms smuggled to Trinidad and Tobago from either the US or Canada. An observed decrease in prices of some illicit firearms probably indicates an oversupply.","text - environment":"There is no indication of a flora crimes market in Trinidad and Tobago and, although parrots and monkeys are reportedly trafficked from Venezuela through Trinidad and Tobago on to Europe, there is no information to suggest the presence of a significant fauna-crimes market. Similarly, gold appears to be smuggled from Venezuela into Trinidad and Tobago, where local companies in Port of Spain offer charter flights to ship it to destination markets.","text - drugs":"The heroin trade is rather limited in Trinidad and Tobago, which serves mostly as a destination country. Nevertheless, local gangs are allegedly involved in the distribution of heroin and the country is increasingly being used as a transit point for heroin deliveries. Importantly, the presumed growth is attributed to Venezuelan migrants in Trinidad and Tobago looking to \u2018pay the bills\u2019 through engaging in the drug trade. While high levels of violence and corruption are associated with cocaine trafficking, heroin-specific data remains limited. Conversely, cocaine trafficking is quite significant in the country, with foreign actors exercising influence over the market. The country lies along one of the world\u2019s most significant cocaine corridors, which conditions Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s role as a transit country for South American cocaine bound for the US and Europe. Although to a lesser extent, a domestic cocaine market exists as well. The well-established cargo routes between Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Venezuela facilitates the cocaine trade, with drugs being concealed in legitimate cargo vessels, from where they are handed over to smaller local vessels at sea or delivered to specific drop-off locations in the region. The northern port of Chaguaramas, the largest yacht marina in the Caribbean, is an important hub for the illicit trade, as yachts there have been used to stash cocaine from Venezuela before selling and moving it to Europe via yachts or by air. Notably, Trinidad and Tobago is a significant point of transit for cocaine shipped to other eastern Caribbean islands. The country has, however, refused entry of yachts since the coronavirus pandemic began, which has reportedly displaced much of the cocaine trafficking to Grenada. ##&& While Trinidad and Tobago is mostly a waypoint for cannabis coming from South America and destined for the US and Europe, a large and increasing domestic market exists as well. Cannabis shipments primarily arrive in the country from Venezuela, St Vincent and Guyana via small boats or cargo vessels at legal ports of entry. In addition, information suggests that cargo ships are offloading cannabis to smaller vessels at sea. Gangs in the country also allegedly collaborate with counterparts from St Vincent to traffic cannabis, and are now believed to provide supplies for cannabis cultivation, while Vincentians may provide land and labour in return for shared profits of cannabis distribution. Notably, illegal importation and sale of marijuana seeds from the US and Canada, mostly via courier, have increased since 2019. Corruption is reportedly rampant, with police and customs officials often accepting bribes, while the market is observed to drive the increase in violent crime and gun culture. Consumption of synthetic drugs in Trinidad and Tobago is relatively small and limited to the Chinese community, although synthetic drug-use among students is a growing concern. The influx of Chinese nationals into the country also seems to correlate with an increase in the import and use of ketamine. Criminal gangs are believed to control the synthetic-drug market, and there has been an increase in the variety of pills available since 2018.","text - criminal actors":"Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s strategic position is believed to appeal to transnational criminal groups, especially those engaged in trafficking drugs to the US, Canada and Europe. Foreign actors, however, tend not to have a permanent presence in the country. Over recent years, many Venezuelan criminal groups have migrated to Trinidad and Tobago, with the most well-known being the Evander gang, also known as the Deltano Liberation Front. Corruption in Trinidad and Tobago is rampant and state-embedded actors reportedly facilitate organized-crime activities. Despite such allegations, however, there is no evidence of state-embedded actors being directly involved in criminality. ##&& Information suggests that there are between 95 and 102 criminal networks in Trinidad and Tobago, totalling between 1 200 and 1 300 individuals. Criminal networks tend to be small, with either no or limited links to transnational organizations or political influence. Such groups are involved primarily in drug trafficking, although it is alleged that they also engage in arms trafficking and fraud. The majority of these networks are concentrated in the Port of Spain, but a strong presence has been observed in impoverished communities in urban areas as well. Besides criminal networks, mafia-style structures also operate in the Port of Spain, especially around Laventille. The latter hold substantial control over poor and urban areas around the city. With more than 600 members, Jamaat al Muslimeen, led by Yasin Abu Bakr, is believed to be the most well-known mafia structure in the country. It is allegedly involved in drug and arms trafficking, extortion, kidnapping, money laundering and human smuggling. In general, mafia-style structures are reportedly highly violent, while some of their leaders double up as \u2018community leaders\u2019 striving towards political power, which could be perceived as a way of infiltrating legitimate state structures.","text - leadership and governance":"Despite criminal structures providing security, welfare and even education in some areas, authorities in Trinidad and Tobago have taken a strong stance against organized crime, and criminal structures do not appear to be influencing the democratic process. In addition, the country is rather stable, having made substantive progress in reducing vulnerability to conflict and collapse. The perception of corruption is relatively high and challenges with the adherence and implementation of anti-corruption measures remain. However, the legislative framework guiding access to information is well grounded. ##&& Trinidad and Tobago is party to most international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime and authorities have reportedly established proper collaboration channels with counterparts in the area of anti-organized crime, and anti-drug trafficking in particular. Cooperation occurs via the transnational organized crime unit (TOCU) within the Ministry of National Security and INTERPOL\u2019s National Central Bureau in the Port of Spain. Trinidad and Tobago has a fairly strong legal framework that addresses all forms of organized crime activities, stipulating policies for the investigation, arrest, prosecution, adjudication and punishment of criminals. The country\u2019s legislation regarding precursor chemicals for synthetic drugs, however, needs to be updated. Trinidad and Tobago made an important step in decriminalizing the cultivation and possession of small quantities of cannabis in 2019, but the impact remains to be seen.","text - criminal justice and security":"Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s judicial system is generally independent, but widely perceived as underfunded, weak and inefficient. Allegedly, the judiciary is somewhat influenced by political pressure and corruption. The prison system also faces significant challenges, including overcrowding, corruption and abuse, although there is no evidence to suggest criminal actors are able to exert control over prisons. There are organized-crime-specific law-enforcement units in the country \u2013 the TOCU, which has an excellent reputation for integrity and professionalism, and the organized crime, narcotics and firearms bureau. On the other hand, many law-enforcement officials are accused of excessive use of force and some have faced allegations of close links with gang leaders. Additionally, members of the armed forces and customs officials have been accused of facilitating trafficking and smuggling of drugs, weapons and humans. The country\u2019s highly porous borders, along with its proximity to South American drug markets and excellent transport links to other Caribbean countries and to Europe, render it very susceptible to trafficking flows. The country\u2019s border control has been further compromised by the Venezuelan crisis. Among the agencies responsible for policing Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s borders are the customs agency and the coastguard. While staffing is reportedly an issue with the former, lessening the agency\u2019s effectiveness, the coastguard is technically well equipped and has its own intelligence and analysis unit, allowing it to function accordingly.","text - economic and financial environment":"Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s relatively stable economy, developed financial system and geographic position render it vulnerable to money-laundering operations. Despite the country criminalizing money laundering and establishing a financial intelligence unit to enforce regulations for the prevention and control of money laundering, terrorism financing and the forfeiture of illicitly derived assets, Trinidad and Tobago still rates poorly by a range of standards. Thus, in 2018 the EU put Trinidad and Tobago on its money-laundering blacklist due to issues related to transparency. Since then, however, the country has made substantial efforts to address the shortfalls of its anti-money laundering regime. Businesses in the country operate largely free from criminal activities. Nevertheless, criminal organizations have been active in extortion rackets and are also known to extort contractors carrying out public works projects.","text - civil society and social protection":"Trinidad and Tobago has a fairly robust framework in place to grant support to victims of modern slavery, providing for adequate relocation and protection measures. Its witness protection programme is also excellent and has been recognized as one of the safest in the region. Non-state actors also play a significant role in victim and witness support, with several NGOs providing shelter and other social services to adult and child victims of trafficking, as well as to drug users and drug offenders set to be released from prison. A number of NGOs also work towards reducing violence and crime in vulnerable populations, while Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s Citizen Security Programme seeks to achieve that through police reform, community-based prevention strategies and strengthening the country\u2019s Ministry of National Security and police services. Media freedom is well established in the country, although certain pieces of legislation, including those pertaining to whistle-blower and data protection, as well as cybercrime, may negatively impact the media landscape.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Port of Spain","GDP (current $US million)":"24269.71","Income group":"High income","Population":"1394973","Land Area (sq. km)":"5130","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"52.9","Freedom in the World Index":"82","Human Development Index":"0.8","Global Peace Index":"2.08","Democracy Index":"7.16","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"40","GDP per capita (current US$)":"17398","1":"4.94","1.1":"4.25","1.2":"5.63","2":"5.21"},{"Corresp":"185","ISO-3":"USA","Country":"United States","ISO-2":"US","Continent":"Americas","Region":"North America","Flag file":"us.png","1.

Forced labour primarily occurs in the construction, domestic service, beauty and agricultural sectors, while sex trafficking largely applies to escort services, pornography and outdoor solicitation. Most victims are from the US, Mexico and the Philippines, and perpetrators are usually members of organized networks. The market targets vulnerable groups, including children in the child-welfare and juvenile-justice systems, homeless youth, unaccompanied non-citizen children without lawful immigration status, drug users, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer individuals, victims with disabilities, Native American women and girls, and migrant labourers. Although it may be too early to ascertain the full impact of COVID-19 on human trafficking, vulnerability to both sexual and labour exploitation increased considerably amid the pandemic as people spent more time online (in particular children unable to attend school) and as the economic damage caused by lockdown restrictions took its toll on workers in already precarious situations. ##&& Human smuggling into the US is consolidated along the south-west border, involving domestic and foreign criminal networks, as well as state-embedded actors. Individuals from Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are increasingly the focus of Mexican smuggling operations into the US, sometimes resulting in fatalities. Criminal organizations charge smuggling networks that pass through smuggling corridors. Payments are also received by corrupt low-level officials, including Mexican police, migration officers and US border-patrol agents. Notably, there is little evidence of drug-trafficking organizations engaging in human smuggling. While the COVID-19 pandemic caused some initial disruptions to smuggling networks at the Mexico border, there is little evidence to suggest a major decline in the human smuggling market throughout 2020 on the whole. On the contrary, if unemployment rates in common source countries rise due to the pandemic, it is likely that human smuggling will increase in volume in the near future.","text - trade":"The US is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of arms, and is a source and destination for difficult-to-purchase firearms, including machine guns. The civilian right to bear arms is constitutionally protected in the US and ownership is widespread. The legal purchase of guns is relatively easy in some states; these are then transported, resold or trafficked to states or countries with stricter gun-control laws. Despite the liberal gun laws that make access to firearms relatively easy, the US nevertheless hosts a significant black market for weapons. Moreover, US foreign trade and support often takes the form of military and arms-related support, furthering global dissemination. Most firearms seized and traded in Mexico are purchased in south-west US border states, and the US is also the biggest source of illegal foreign guns in Brazil. Weapons legally and illegally exported from the US are obtained by armed gangs, drug traffickers and terrorist organizations, fuelling conflict, shootings, suicides, homicides, as well as drive-by, law enforcement, unintentional and mass shootings. Growing distrust of US law enforcement has also led to increased gun violence.","text - environment":"The US is the main source, destination and transit hub for illegal flora and fauna in the region. The US exports protected species such as Pachypodium and Guaiacum, and plays a concerning role as a hub for the trading of the endangered Aquilaria tree species native to South-eastern Asia. Although illegal logging is not widespread, the US is a large importer from regions with high illegal logging rates. With regard to fauna, illegal imports include ivory, rhino horn, narwhal tusk, shark fins, turtles and reptiles. Additionally, the US is the main market for species illegally harvested in Latin America, including parrots, reptiles, molluscs, monkeys and frogs. Domestic wildlife crimes target mountain lions, bobcats, rattlesnakes and paddlefish eggs. A large percentage of wildlife products entering the US with documentation have laundered or illegal origins. The number of US Fish and Wildlife Service enforcement officers has not kept pace with trafficking, and once illegal specimens arrive, there is no comprehensive federal or state agency to supervise, inspect and stop domestic trade. ##&& Illicitly extracted gold, often transiting Miami on small planes, constitutes part of a larger illegal mining market in Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Guyana for silver, copper, coltan, iron, coal, emeralds and uranium. Illegal gold is legalized with falsified paperwork and then sold to US or international refineries selling gold bars to US-based multinational corporations. Since gold bullion is classified as a commodity, once imported, treasury department reporting requirements and customs duties do not apply, hampering anti-money laundering efforts. Lastly, as organized criminal groups in Mexico have diversified, stolen fuel has skyrocketed over the past decade, an important proportion of which is sold in the US (in addition to fuel stolen domestically by criminal gangs in the US itself).","text - drugs":"The US drug markets are all among the largest in the world. Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the US, and the country is both a source and destination for cannabis. While illegal under federal law, states have different regulations regarding possession, use and cultivation. Most cannabis is illicitly produced domestically by drug-trafficking organizations or by state-licensed growers. The illicit market is supplied by illegal, domestically produced cannabis; diverted domestic, state-approved cannabis; and foreign-produced cannabis trafficked into the US, mainly from Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Canada and the Caribbean. However, the quality of Mexican and Caribbean cannabis is considered inferior to that produced in the US and Canada. ##&& Synthetic opioids generally dominate the US market, with profits mostly being accrued by foreign actors, including Mexican mafia-style groups. Methamphetamine use has skyrocketed in the US in recent years, and primarily originates in Mexico as a low-cost, high-purity and high-potency alternative to that in the US. Synthetic cannabinoids, cathinones and precursors are mostly trafficked into the US by Chinese networks. Illicit Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are the most lethal opioids used in the US. One of the biggest market impacts is the increase in lethal overdoses involving synthetic opioids and psychostimulant drug poisoning. Although law enforcement agencies are dedicated to combating the market, dark-net Fentanyl and social media transactions are extensive. ##&& Although heroin has largely been displaced by opioids such as Fentanyl, seizures of the drug have increased, especially on the south-west border, and the mixing of heroin with Fentanyl is common. The US heroin market primarily involves Mexican heroin, and mafia-style groups control smuggling routes across the south-west border. The trade also contributes to territorial struggles between gangs. Thousands of deaths in the US are attributed annually to heroin overdoses, increasingly due to high potency and the mixing of heroin or cocaine with Fentanyl. High disease rates have also resulted from shared syringes, and there is a relationship between the opioid crisis and the rise in numbers of children in foster care. The availability of cocaine has increased in recent years due to record levels of coca cultivation and cocaine production in Colombia, the primary source of US cocaine, which mostly enters via the south-west border through Mexican networks. In the main, domestic street gangs control retail-level distribution.","text - criminal actors":"Drug trafficking groups, mainly networks and gangs, dominate the attention of US investigators and prosecutors. There are thousands of active gangs nationwide, whose activities focus on drug, arms and human trafficking. Most use violence and work alongside foreign drug trafficking networks. Despite a decrease in activity, mafia-style groups continue to operate in the US, including five major family groups descending from the Cosa Nostra Sicilian mafia, all of which exert substantial control in New York, southern New Jersey and Philadelphia. Collectively, Cosa Nostra has thousands of US-based members and associates involved in illegal markets, including heroin trafficking, money laundering and healthcare fraud targeting the Medicare programme. These groups have significant access to weapons and carry arms openly. Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs, of which there are several hundred operating across the country, are the archetypal mafia-style group in the US. The gangs are highly transnational in nature and are predominantly involved in the drug trafficking market, particular cross-border trafficking. ##&& There are many foreign actors involved in organized crime activities affecting the US. Cybercrimes \u2013particularly identity, financial and election fraud \u2013 often have their source in Eastern Europe and Asia. Latin American criminal organizations are involved in US drug markets (as conduits between source countries and the wholesalers in the US, as opposed to directly on US soil), as are African, Asian, Eurasian, and Middle Eastern criminal organizations. Asian and Balkan criminal organizations are also involved in human smuggling and trafficking. Foreign actors may exert economic and financial power in the US, attempting to influence presidential elections by focusing on so-called swing states and assisting in the production of polarizing rallies. Government corruption may also be on the rise, although investigations and prosecutions have been declining. Some in former president Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle were convicted on federal charges of money laundering and other illicit activities, and Trump himself was accused of engaging with mafia-style groups before taking office.","text - leadership and governance":"Despite presenting a strong public position against organized crime, former president Trump was impeached in 2019. Although acquitted, this was accompanied by allegations of Russian election interference, and the challenging of 2020 election results furthered political division. President Joe Biden has pledged to modernize the immigration system and tackle root causes; such policy changes could impact crime dynamics on the southern border. In the last decade, the US has been militarily involved in conflicts, including in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Libya and Niger, and tensions exist with North Korea, Iran and China. The COVID-19 pandemic has also exposed many structural failings, and public support for government has declined due to issues regarding transparency, accountability, corporate regulation, agency leadership, candidate screening and training. Oversight is at its weakest in decades. Despite the treasury department\u2019s fiscal service, access to information is considered moderate. The federal nature of the US political system is such that the quality of legislation and regulatory frameworks for transparency and disclosure differ vastly between states. ##&& The US is a signatory to international agreements related to organized crime, corruption and environmental protection. Nonetheless, the Trump administration withdrew from a number of international treaties. The US has a number of extradition and mutual legal-assistance treaties, but relations with Mexico, previously marked by relatively easy extradition processes, appear to have changed. The US legal framework criminalizes organized-criminal acts, such as human smuggling, human trafficking, goods produced through forced labour, drugs trafficking and some environmental crimes. Laws cover the investigation, arrest, prosecution, adjudication and punishment of perpetrators, especially for drug trafficking, a federal and state-level felony. However, there is no federal arms trafficking law in the US, which is the primary facilitator of gunrunning across state lines.","text - criminal justice and security":"The US has the largest reported incarcerated population globally. Concerns regarding overcrowding, basic needs, deaths in custody and the need for greater capacity in terms of medical, mental-health and substance-abuse care have been reported. Prison gangs are abundant, particularly in California but also in Texas, including the Texas Syndicate, Mexikanemi, Barrio Azteca and Tango Blast among others. The judicial system appears to be hampered by the election of many lower-level judges and the political nature of many judicial appointments. A number of agencies working within the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security focus on organized crime at the federal level. A Department of State (DoS) bureau also specifically focuses on organized crime, and the US is one of few countries in the region that has a federal agency specifically focused on guns, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The reported budget increase for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) may indicate the prioritization of fighting organized crime, and state and local-level law enforcement agencies have also been allocated increasingly high resources. Nevertheless, concerns exist about unqualified agency leadership, poor candidate screening, insufficient training and an erosion of trust in law enforcement, due in part to police killings. ##&& The US shares land borders with Canada and Mexico. Although the US\u2013Canada border is the longest international border in the world, the US\u2013Mexico border is more challenging to police. The CBP, whose mission is to prevent human smuggling and contraband, is in charge of monitoring the country entry points. However, their efforts are still circumnavigated by criminal networks and many experts argue that the strengthening of barriers at the southern border strengthens the hand of organized criminal organizations by simply making the smuggling, which does not stop as a result of enhanced border security, more expensive.","text - economic and financial environment":"The global dominance of US currency and the number of transactions through US banks creates money-laundering vulnerability, particularly in relation to fraud, drug trafficking, human smuggling, human trafficking and corruption. Despite effective measures, considerable money laundering and terrorist financing risks still exist. Towards the end of 2020, the US was on the cusp of implementing the most significant changes to its anti-money laundering framework in decades, supported by both main political parties, including, crucially, compulsory registration of beneficial owners. ##&& The regulatory framework has significant gaps related to vigilance, which changes with agency leadership and political will. US property rights are guaranteed, although protections have been uneven. The DoS is responsible for building a strong economy while considering national security regulations. Although regulatory capacity is not considered an issue, challenges persist with regard to the political will to empower and encourage adequate oversight.","text - civil society and social protection":"US victim and witness support are robust, with the contribution of thousands of non-state and government service providers, as well as the DoS Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. A robust state framework provides support to modern slavery victims, and an active national media contributes to effective victim- and witness-support efforts. Civil society organizations also provide crime-prevention strategies and environmental protection, spurred by initiatives such as the National Crime Prevention Council. Governmental drug trafficking elimination efforts recently adopted a prevention focus, investing in treatment and the provision of alternative pain medication. The US has among the most developed mass media in the world, with more than a thousand daily newspapers, four major commercial television networks, and a 24-hour rolling news service that report on state efforts to combat organized crime. The Trump administration, however, employed rhetoric attacks targeting media. Lethal attacks on journalists and media houses have also been reported. Overall, the media environment was undoubtedly rendered significantly more fragile during the course of the Trump administration.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Washington D.C.","GDP (current $US million)":"21433226.00","Income group":"High income","Population":"328239523","Land Area (sq. km)":"9831510","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"44.6","Freedom in the World Index":"83","Human Development Index":"0.93","Global Peace Index":"2.31","Democracy Index":"7.92","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"67","GDP per capita (current US$)":"65298","1":"5.50","1.1":"5.50","1.2":"5.50","2":"6.58"},{"Corresp":"186","ISO-3":"URY","Country":"Uruguay","ISO-2":"UY","Continent":"Americas","Region":"South America","Flag file":"uy.png","1.

Many of those working in legal prostitution venues are trafficking victims. Permeable borders with Argentina and Brazil facilitate trafficking, and workers are subjected to forced labour in construction, domestic and cleaning services, elderly care, wholesale stores, textile and timber industries, agriculture, and fishing. Victims are mainly from Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Argentina, and other South American countries. Impoverished Uruguayan families also abet the exploitation of children in prostitution, as well as domestic and agricultural servitude in rural areas. The majority of convicted perpetrators are Uruguayan citizens. Uruguayan women, girls, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ+) individuals are also forced into prostitution abroad, in Spain, Italy, the US, Argentina, and Brazil, among other countries. ##&& Human smuggling appears negligible, as Uruguay shares porous borders with Argentina and Brazil, and crossing without documentation is common. Nonetheless, the economic crises in Cuba and Venezuela have resulted in the proliferation of smuggling networks providing accommodation, transfers and papers in the region. Individuals smuggled from Cuba usually arrive in Uruguay via Guyana and Brazil. The smuggling of Chinese nationals into Argentina via Uruguay has also been reported.","text - trade":"Uruguay is a destination country for illegal weapons, primarily from Brazil. Arms trafficking has increased in recent decades due to high local demand, but there are few cases of reported corruption, and these usually involve the police or army. A lack of harmonized gun regulations across the various countries in the region has generated an increased demand for trafficked weapons in the country, notably from Brazil. The illicit trade in arms has resulted in an increase in the killing of Uruguayan police, who are robbed or killed by criminals trying to get their firearms.","text - environment":"Uruguay has effective state control over crimes involving non-renewable resources, and as a major exporter of agricultural products, it has comparatively strict controls on the import and export of flora and fauna. The illegal flora trade is negligible because of a lack of biodiversity, and the illegal fauna market also appears small. Nonetheless, dozens of reptile, arachnid, insect, mammal and bird species are seized monthly, including the endangered yellow cardinal. Most exotic animals enter Uruguay from Brazil and Paraguay, and there are reports of escaped jaguars being purchased on the black market. Notably, cattle, horse and sheep theft by small local criminal groups has been increasing. This is a critical issue for an economy reliant on agricultural exports as thefts effectively discourage the business, particularly those working with sheep. Additionally, widespread illegal fishing in Uruguayan waters is facilitated by the navy\u2019s lack of patrol vessels.","text - drugs":"Although there is a legal market, Uruguay is a source, transit and destination country for illegal cannabis. Consumption is high compared to other countries in the region, and it is on the rise. A large proportion of locally consumed cannabis is supplied by criminal organizations via the black market, and is associated with a rise in homicides and violence. Before legalization, the market was dominated by Paraguayan networks. Although some still buy cannabis illegally, prices have adapted to the new legal market and most consumers who illegally purchase cannabis do so through immediate social networks of home growers. There are some small-scale networks of unregistered growers; the national police are aware of these and break up any attempts to export cannabis from Uruguay. Nevertheless, due to its high quality, legally produced cannabis is still trafficked to neighbouring countries. However, since the Uruguayan market is small, it is unlikely that this will become a significant problem. ##&& While cannabis use is far more prevalent in Uruguay, cocaine and coca paste constitutes the biggest drug market with regard to seizures. Nevertheless, the domestic market for cocaine is quite small, and foreign traffickers take advantage of Uruguay\u2019s porous borders with Argentina and Brazil, often using Montevideo as a logistical hub for drug-transit activities to Europe. Moreover, criminal organizations from Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and Russia are currently operating in Uruguay. A recent rise in homicides has been connected to clashes between drug-trafficking gangs aiming to control neighbourhoods, territories and trafficking routes. ##&& By comparison the heroin trade in Uruguay is not substantial compared to the domestic market for cannabis and cocaine. However, Uruguay is a destination country for synthetic drugs, and although overall consumption is low, their use is growing. Ecstasy, primarily produced in Brazil, is considered expensive and is largely consumed by middle- to high-income individuals. ","text - criminal actors":"There is minimal evidence of mafia-style groups operating within Uruguay. Instead, organized crime is predominantly characterized by small family clans operating as loose criminal networks in the peripheries of major cities, the most well known being Los Chingas and Los Kamalas. The former is involved in drug trafficking, robberies and cattle rustling. Although comparatively rare, extortion, kidnappings, and planned attacks against government officials and property do occur, and clashes between criminals over territorial control are increasing. While organized-criminal organizations from a number of Latin American countries operate in Uruguay, it is not a hub for their operations. The main foreign actor is Primeiro Comando da Capital, which has increasingly been trafficking cocaine and cannabis. Brazilian criminal actors are prominent in border towns, where they collaborate with Uruguayan members to conduct smuggling, drug trafficking and cattle rustling. The Mexican criminal organization Los Cuinis is also active in Uruguay, concentrated primarily in Montevideo and Canelones. ##&& Although police and customs corruption exists, incidents of low-level corruption appear minimal, and the police are ranked among the most trustworthy institutions in the country. Uruguay has one of the strongest judicial systems in the hemisphere and violators are generally punished, with no evidence of state actors systematically facilitating or engaging in criminal activity. ","text - leadership and governance":"Uruguay is a democratic, constitutional republic with a relatively robust state, strong political parties, a participative citizenry and high levels of institutionalization. The democratic process and state services are largely free from criminal influence and the government has declared a strong counter-organized crime stance, with rhetoric effectively translating into policy. The ministry of the interior's budget and its personnel number have also increased substantially. Although corruption is low, party financing is insufficiently regulated. However, public-body transparency is promoted by law, and the fundamental right to access government information is guaranteed. The board of transparency and public ethics promotes public policies, regulations and actions that strengthen state transparency, advises the judiciary and public administration on corruption issues, and receives and safeguards the legal declarations of public officials. ##&& Uruguay has ratified international agreements related to organized crime, corruption, drugs, arms, and flora and fauna. The country\u2019s legalization of cannabis, however, contravenes one of these conventions. Uruguay also has domestic laws related to money laundering, drug trafficking and production, weapons, human trafficking, victim protection, and cross-border organized crime. The attorney general\u2019s office investigates and prosecutes crimes related to child trafficking and exploitation. State agencies in charge of issues related to migration and intelligence, INTERPOL, the national anti-drug brigade and the national police, as well as the ministry of interior in collaboration with the republican guard, a so-called militarized police force, are all involved in the fight against organized crime. Cooperation with INTERPOL and other law-enforcement agencies is strong, and INTERPOL\u2019s National Central Bureau in Montevideo plays an important role in countering trafficking and preserving national and regional security. Uruguay has extradition agreements with Argentina, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, the US, Mexico, Paraguay and Venezuela, and has taken steps to change its reputation as a tax haven. However, legislation regarding the trafficking of motor vehicles, a significant problem in the country, is lacking.","text - criminal justice and security":"The Uruguayan prison system suffers from overcrowding, poor living conditions, high recidivism, violence, torture and impunity. Although criminal groups do not exert significant control over prisons, criminal operations, such as drug trafficking, occur. Nonetheless, several prosecutor\u2019s offices specialize in organized crime and appear to be effective, although they lack resources. Uruguay also has strong laws and internal regulations that govern police interactions. The national police, however, face difficulties providing basic safety, in part due to lack of sufficient training. The Ministry of the Interior oversees public security, along with the republican national guard, an elite police force considered well equipped and trained. ##&& Although not a drug-producing country, foreign traffickers exploit Uruguay's porous borders with Argentina and Brazil. Drug trafficking in Uruguay has increased, perhaps due to Brazil's militarization and zero-tolerance approach. Nonetheless, little evidence suggests that criminal organizations control parts of the border. To support the police, the government has authorized military surveillance, patrolling, identification of persons, vehicle control and criminal detention in border areas, but structural challenges within the air force and navy, such as inoperable planes and a lack of radars and vessels, compromise territorial integrity. ","text - economic and financial environment":"Although traditionally considered a tax haven, Uruguay has made several regulatory advances, introducing laws addressing money laundering, terrorism financing, fiscal transparency, and financial inclusion. This forces banks to identify the final beneficiaries of funds, creates traceability for financial operations, and incorporates tax evasion as a precedent of money laundering. Additionally, the national anti-money laundering secretariat is responsible for implementing money-laundering and terrorism-financing policies. Despite high taxes, the economy is well regulated and the state is well equipped to ensure that legitimate businesses operate freely, while upholding land and property rights.","text - civil society and social protection":"The prosecutor's office oversees the protection of victims and witnesses, but although measures to support victims of organized crime have been implemented, it is hard to evaluate their efficacy. Many victims and witnesses may not go to the police for fear of retaliation, and approximately half of all homicides are never solved. More can also be done to identify and support victims of modern slavery. ##&& The government finances a number of drug-treatment centres and the national drug board has a programme called El Portal Amarillo, which tracks those receiving treatment and also attends to their families. Additionally, harm-reduction campaigns have affected the influence of the synthetic drugs market by encouraging users to get products tested for purity. Nonetheless, treatment is scarce and generally run by NGOs such as Remar and Beraca. Other well-known NGOs include the network of youth advocacy organizations, Nada Crece a la Sombra. Moreover, civil society is engaged in the debate over law enforcement and the age of criminal responsibility. With the exception of cannabis-related measures, prevention policies and initiatives in Uruguay are scarce. Although no organized-crime-prevention strategy exists, and local communities are more preoccupied with common street crime, Uruguay does participate in multilateral activities against transnational crime. Although the national police has implemented efforts to re-conceptualize the police\u2013community relationship, these have been sporadic and have not had significant results. ##&& Overall, the media environment in Uruguay is favourable, although threats, intimidation, political pressure, judicial harassment and at least one attempted murder have been recorded.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Montevideo","GDP (current $US million)":"56045.91","Income group":"High income","Population":"3461734","Land Area (sq. km)":"176220","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"35.9","Freedom in the World Index":"98","Human Development Index":"0.82","Global Peace Index":"1.70","Democracy Index":"8.61","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"71","GDP per capita (current US$)":"16190","1":"2.69","1.1":"2.75","1.2":"2.63","2":"7.75"},{"Corresp":"189","ISO-3":"VEN","Country":"Venezuela","ISO-2":"VE","Continent":"Americas","Region":"South America","Flag file":"ve.png","1.

Vulnerable children are also exploited by relatives for domestic servitude, or trafficked into armed groups operating in Colombia and on Venezuela\u2019s borders.

After the closure of the Venezuelan\u2013Colombian border in 2015, irregular crossings increased significantly, with a variety of actors, including officials from the national Venezuelan guard (GNB), Colombian mafia-style groups such as the National Liberation Army (ELN), and opportunistic Venezuelan individuals, facilitating the border crossing in exchange for payment or other forms of bribes. The fight for control over the smuggling market intensified between the ELN, dissident rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), criminal Colombian gangs (BACRIM), and Venezuelan gangs and colectivos (collectives). The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the market. The closure of the border with Colombia, together with tight restrictions in the latter, saw the price of smugglers\u2019 services increase.

The most commonly trafficked weapons are 38-calibre and 9mm semi-automatic pistols, in addition to AK-47 ammunition, often used by Colombian guerrilla groups. Criminal organizations traffic arms from Miami or between San Antonio del T\u00e1chira and C\u00facuta. In addition, Brazilian gangs, particularly Primeiro Comando da Capital, have smuggled Venezuelan military weapons into Brazil.","text - environment":"Venezuela is a source for flora and fauna crimes, including illegally extracted timber and Cucurito palm, facilitated by the lack of investigations, inventories, or government presence in national parks. Fauna crime is spurred by demand from the US, China and Europe. It mainly involves birds, turtles and snakes, and when caught, perpetrators often receive only minor penalties or fines. Criminal networks involved in wildlife trafficking include Los Depredadores, a gang dedicated to trading in dolphins; thefts from zoos have also occurred. The market is predominately run by domestic actors and is socially accepted, with food shortages resulting in the consumption of local fauna. ##&& ##&& Venezuela is also a significant source for gold trafficking, and profits are accrued by both domestic criminal groups and the government. A number of companies operate mines with government approval, but most gold is illegally exported from Venezuela via private and commercial flights to the United Arab Emirates, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, Morocco, Dubai, Turkey and the US, although the latter has imposed sanctions on Venezuelan gold. In Venezuela, top military officers allegedly receive large bribes in the state of Amazonas, where a former FARC combatant leads efforts to control illegal gold mines. Members of the national guard use the agency\u2019s influence to levy informal tax on gold production and routes leading from the mines, and a state mining company also reportedly obtains its gold from illegal mining projects. Furthermore, the military facilitates clandestine flights to transport the gold to the Caribbean. ##&& Venezuela has the biggest reserves of oil in the world and smuggles gasoline, also used for cocaine production, to neighbouring countries. Gasoline smuggling involves the national guard and national oil company; however, due to recent fuel scarcities, fuel is now also smuggled from Colombia into Venezuela.","text - drugs":"The synthetic drug and heroin markets appear minor in Venezuela, although heroin trafficking routes do exist between Venezuela and Puerto Rico. Cocaine, produced in neighbouring Colombia, is Venezuela\u2019s biggest criminal market. Government involvement is rife, with corrupt security forces participating in the market via the Cartel of the Suns (C\u00e1rtel de los Soles). Once cocaine is imported from Colombia, clandestine flights depart daily for the US and Europe via Central America. Criminal organizations also use boats to transport the drug to the Netherlands Antilles, St Martin, the British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Cannabis is the most commonly seized drug in Venezuela, and it may follow the same routes as cocaine. The ELN is believed to have cannabis plantations on both sides of the Serran\u00eda de Perij\u00e1, and domestic criminal and prison networks are in charge of local distribution.","text - criminal actors":"Venezuelan mafia-style groups are violent and have substantial territorial control and weapons access. Megabandas, a new type of criminal organization originating in prisons, have developed control over territories, and are involved in arms, cocaine and non-renewable resource trafficking. The most notorious include El Juvenal, El tren del Norte, El tren del Llano, Los Capracio, El Tot\u00f3, El tren de Aragua and El Coqui. Criminal structures known as pranes also control illegal weapon and drug markets within prisons, engaging in violence and instigating deadly prison riots and attacks against state security officials. COVID-19 restrictions resulted in an increase in both the demand for contraband goods and in the power of the mafia. The colectivos are armed, unregulated groups financed by the government and, although their initial aim was to protect communities, many are accused of drug trafficking and violence against anti-government protestors. The most influential are Los Tupamaros, Alexis Vive, La Piedrita, Colectivo Montaraz, and Colectivo Tres Raices in Caracas. Another group with mafia characteristics is the Patriotic Forces of National Liberation, previously known as the Bolivarian Liberation Forces, a pro-government guerrilla group that split in 2008. Other criminal actors include Colombian criminal groups, primarily FARC dissidents and ELN, who use Venezuela as a base for cocaine, gas, gold and human smuggling. FARC groups move drugs to Mexico and Brazil in return for high-grade weaponry and are also involved in gold and coltan extraction and smuggling. The ELN is involved in cocaine, arms and human smuggling and is tolerated by Venezuelan authorities and security forces who are accused of aiding its expansion. BACRIM groups are also involved in cocaine and human smuggling. ##&& Loosely organized criminal networks may use violence to commit theft, contract killing, extortion and the street sale of drugs. Their increasing membership may be ascribed to the current economic and humanitarian crises. The cocaine trade is reportedly aided by state actors and armed forces; many officials are accused of facilitating drug trafficking through airports and via connections with Colombian guerrilla groups as members of the loosely knit C\u00e1rtel de los Soles. In addition, the GNB has allegedly collaborated with Colombian drug traffickers, and political elites have also been accused of cocaine trafficking and of using the state-owned oil company for money laundering.","text - leadership and governance":"The Venezuelan state is accused of involvement in contraband, cocaine smuggling, money laundering, patronage, the illegal exploitation of natural resources, exchange-rate manipulation, and corruption schemes related to the distribution of food and medicine. Many officials, including President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, are under investigation or have been indicted. The regime\u2019s credibility suffers due to mass emigration and a humanitarian crisis caused by the socio-economic meltdown and political instability. Venezuela\u2019s democratic institutions are weak, with power concentrated in the executive branch, and the government has closed avenues for political dissent, restricted the media, voters and civil liberties, and prosecuted perceived opponents. Maduro\u2019s re-election was widely condemned as illegitimate, resulting in opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 proclaiming himself president, a claim supported by several dozen countries around the world, including the US. ##&& Organized criminal groups have contributed to a rise in homicides, kidnappings, extortion and violence, and the government often blames Colombian criminals as the only source of violence and crime. Venezuela has failed to comprehensively criminalize corruption, money laundering and human trafficking, and instead of solving deep-rooted problems national institutions have been used to increase the power of the executive branch. There is also a lack of public information with regard to corruption, crime and violence, and Venezuela is considered to have among the highest levels of corruption within government and wider society in the world. ##&& Venezuela is party to international agreements on organized crime, human trafficking, corruption, drugs and wildlife protection, and has extradition treaties with Spain, Italy, Australia, Uruguay, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia and Chile. Nonetheless, Venezuela fails to adhere to its international obligations with regard to narcotics, and repressive measures and military tactics in response to crime have led to human-rights violations. National drug and arms legislation have had minimum results, and anti-human-trafficking measures are lacking. Venezuelan law covers organized crime and terrorist financing, but important mechanisms to combat domestic criminal organizations are absent.","text - criminal justice and security":"Venezuela\u2019s judicial system lacks impartiality, does not operate independently from the executive branch, and is particularly vulnerable to corrupt practices. Most judges hold provisional appointments, leading to judicial paralysis. The prison system also suffers from corruption, weak security, poor infrastructure, overcrowding, insufficient staffing, and poorly trained guards, allowing for the rise of armed gangs. Conditions are aggravated by inefficient judicial procedures resulting in high pre-trial detention rates, and by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, despite reforms, the police agency responsible for the forensic investigation and crime statistics is accused of human-rights violations, including extrajudicial killings. Its hard-line approach, and the lack of sanctions over misconduct, has compounded distrust within communities towards security forces. ##&& Crime and human-rights violations, perpetrated by criminal groups and law enforcement, is rife along Venezuela\u2019s borders, particularly with Colombia. The closure of the border contributed to the growth of transnational organized crime and exacerbated corruption in the armed forces. The lack of national, state and municipal authorities, paired with local authorities\u2019 willingness to accept bribes, further complicate the situation, and local police and collectives often wield territorial control outside of the rule of law.","text - economic and financial environment":"Venezuela is at high risk for money laundering and terrorism financing due to a lack of political will, an unstable economy, limited bilateral cooperation, and weak anti-money laundering supervision and enforcement. The largest proportion of money laundering is generated by drug trafficking, as well as corruption and smuggling. Price controls and the foreign-exchange system is a source for currency manipulation and goods arbitrage, while the main law aimed at bribery, abuse of office, extortion, and money laundering is not considered effective. ##&& International sanctions have resulted in the country increasingly selling oil via grey markets abroad. Venezuela remains dependent on oil revenues, and declining oil production and prices caused inflation to skyrocket. The state subsequently tightened its control over the economy and placed blame on the private sector for shortages. The cutting of three zeros off the value of the bol\u00edvar was followed by promises of increases in the minimum wage and the use of a non-existent state-backed cryptocurrency. Strong state intervention, political instability and foreign sanctions have also inhibited foreign investment, and private firms are competitively disadvantaged compared to public enterprises, particularly in terms of gaining access to foreign currency at the official exchange rate. The economic crisis has caused citizens to struggle to meet basic needs, with most now living below the poverty line.","text - civil society and social protection":"Government institutions do not offer adequate protection for victims and witnesses of human-rights violations and modern slavery. Distrust in authorities is heightened by the deaths during government raids, and witnesses and victims\u2019 families refute claims that victims were armed. Many victims fear retaliation and do not trust authorities to conduct investigations. Initiatives to prevent organized crime are lacking, and national law does not address prevention, nor the protection of vulnerable groups. Actions perpetrated by security forces to fight criminal organizations have increased violence and amplified social exclusion, and the Venezuelan observatory of violence has pushed for the creation of programmes to dissuade young people from joining organized-criminal groups. ##&& The relationship between the government and non-state actors is weak because the regime limits criticism, particularly by civil-society organizations and journalists. There have been accusations against the government for trying to control media coverage and of silencing independent outlets, and journalists are subject to intensifying harassment, arrests, and violence by police and intelligence agencies. As a result, numerous reporters have fled in fear of violence or arrest. Foreign journalists are also subject to arrest, persecution and cancelled visas.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Caracas","GDP (current $US million)":"482359.32","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"28515829","Land Area (sq. km)":"912050","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"92.6","Freedom in the World Index":"14","Human Development Index":"0.71","Global Peace Index":"2.94","Democracy Index":"2.76","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"15","GDP per capita (current US$)":"16054","1":"6.64","1.1":"5.65","1.2":"7.63","2":"1.92"}],"1":"5.07","1.1":"4.70","1.1.1":"5.19","1.1.2":"4.47","1.1.3":"5.40","1.1.4":"3.94","1.1.5":"4.21","1.1.6":"4.37","1.1.7":"2.97","1.1.8":"7.14","1.1.9":"5.81","1.1.10":"3.46","1.2":"5.43","1.2.1":"5.40","1.2.2":"5.46","1.2.3":"5.61","1.2.4":"5.24","2":"4.83","2.1":"4.76","2.2":"4.54","2.3":"5.80","2.4":"5.37","2.5":"4.31","2.6":"4.87","2.7":"4.93","2.8":"4.57","2.9":"4.49","2.10":"4.30","2.11":"4.71","2.12":"5.31"},"asia":{"Continent":"Asia","Population":4528374775,"Land Area (sq. km)":31983394,"GDP (current $US million)":31768158.27,"children":[{"Corresp":"1","ISO-3":"AFG","Country":"Afghanistan","ISO-2":"AF","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Southern Asia","Flag file":"af.png","1.

Most victims are subjected to sexual exploitation, forced labour, forced begging and forced recruitment into armed groups. However, human trafficking for the purposes of forced marriage and organ smuggling are also known to occur. An important driver of many of the most prevalent forms of human trafficking is debt bondage. Child trafficking is particularly rampant, with victims being sold to traffickers by their families or organized criminal groups. The trafficking of children is largely driven by a practice of sexual abuse of young boys known as Bacha Bazi. State and non-state armed forces also exploit children in combat, and many victims have been deployed abroad in conflicts across the Middle East, or forced to participate in terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda or ISIL-Khorasan. Foreign victims from neighbouring countries and elsewhere in Asia are trafficked into Afghanistan primarily for sexual exploitation or participation in war. Corrupt government officials play a significant role in facilitating Afghanistan\u2019s human trafficking market. ##&& Due to widespread insecurity and the scarcity of economic opportunity, Afghanistan is the second-largest source country of refugees globally. Since NATO\u2019s 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, the country\u2019s human smuggling market has grown consistently, resulting in more and more organized-criminal groups engaging in human smuggling in recent years. The escalation of conflict and insecurity in 2020 is the primary driver of the outflow of migrants and consequent reliance on human smuggling networks. It is often difficult to distinguish between Afghanistan\u2019s human trafficking and human smuggling markets because many people smuggled to neighbouring countries subsequently fall prey to human trafficking. Some regions of Afghanistan are highly dependent on the human smuggling economy. Human smuggling to Iran in particular is a major industry that generates significant profits and is linked to various other illicit smuggling enterprises. Smugglers often move individuals into the Balochistan province of Pakistan first and then across the border into Iranian Sistan and Balochistan Province, highlighting the porosity at the convergence point of the three international borders.As with the human trafficking market, corrupt government officials facilitate the human smuggling market, often through the black-market sale of foreign visas.","text - trade":"More than four decades of conflict have resulted in arms trafficking becoming a serious problem in Afghanistan. High levels of insecurity engender great demand for weapons and create easy access to black-market weapons for militias, insurgents and civilians. While older weapons from previous conflicts remain in circulation, the oversupply of foreign weapons to Afghan security forces in recent years, mainly from Western countries, has contributed greatly to arms proliferation. Another major issue is the diversion, through raids and the infiltration of military barracks, of high-quality foreign weapons to insurgent and terrorist groups. On top of this, low wages act as an incentive for corrupt military officials to sell weapons to insurgents and locals. The arms trade is also fed from beyond Afghanistan\u2019s borders, with weapons being trafficked into the country from elsewhere in Central Asia. The widespread negative influence yielded by the illicit arms trade on nearly all parts of society is evident in the use of trafficked weapons by insurgents in continuous and ongoing attacks on domestic targets, including civilians, government, and international organizations.","text - environment":"Illicit logging and mining are large contributors to Afghanistan\u2019s illicit economy. As key sources of profit for insurgent and terrorist groups such as the Taliban and ISIL-Khorasan, these commodities also fuel the country\u2019s war economy. The lack of effective mining regulation in Afghanistan renders most mining operations artisanal, and enables the smuggling of minerals to neighbouring countries. Mineral exports are significantly under-reported in official government export data, which fuels significant corruption within the Afghan government while also enriching insurgents (e.g. Taliban), crime groups and other illicit actors and extremists. Simultaneously, proceeds of illicit mining are distributed along patronage networks and are a lifeline for many rural communities. ##&& Afghanistan\u2019s illicit logging market is similarly pervasive, as many locals rely on it to generate income. Due to lack of electricity in parts of Afghanistan, the market is driven in considerable part by demand for firewood as a heating source. High-value illicit timber, such as Afghan cedar, is smuggled into neighbouring Pakistan for rebranding and international export. This also occurs with Afghan talc, the trade of which is largely controlled by the Taliban and ISIL-Khorasan. Although not on a widespread scale, market-related violence surrounding high-value timber species occurs. The illicit logging market has accelerated deforestation, with an estimated half of Afghanistan\u2019s forest cover having been destroyed in recent years. Corrupt Afghan officials facilitate both the illicit logging and illicit mining markets. ##&& While Afghanistan\u2019s fauna crimes market is far less pervasive than the logging or mining markets, poaching remains an important feature of Afghanistan\u2019s illicit economy. The Asiatic cheetah and the snow leopard are among the country\u2019s most endangered species. Rare birds, including various falcon species, are also smuggled out of Afghanistan to Central Asian and Middle Eastern countries. Locals and organized criminal groups engage in the market, and corrupt government officials facilitate hunting trips for foreign visitors targeting rare and endangered species.","text - drugs":"The heroin and synthetic drug trades are by far the most pervasive drug markets in Afghanistan, and both are to a large extent facilitated by corrupt government officials. Afghanistan\u2019s heroin market is the largest worldwide: almost all global production of opium occurs in the country. Afghan heroin is exported to every regionin the world except Latin America. New transport routes have also opened in recent years to better serve various Asian, Middle Eastern and African, and to a lesser extent Nordic, markets. Opium production expanded dramatically after NATO\u2019s 2001 invasion, making the heroin trade a key source of income for many Afghans; poppy cultivation is particularly prominent in southern Afghanistan in regions such as Helmand. Various criminal and insurgent groups, and warlords engage in and profit from the heroin trade, making the opiate economy a significant driver of conflict across the country, and a potential threat to peace negotiations. ##&& As with the heroin trade, Afghanistan\u2019s synthetic drug trade generates revenue for various organized-criminal groups. However, insurgent and terrorist groups, such as the Taliban and ISIL-Khorasan, are not significantly involved. New synthetic street drugs have emerged in recent years and have become popular among the Afghan middle and upper classes \u2013 in particular the widely available \u2018tablet K\u2019, favoured by younger generations, which enters Afghanistan from abroad, primarily from neighbouring countries and elsewhere in Central Asia. Afghanistan is also becoming a major methamphetamine production hub, largely due to the discovery that wild ephedra plants, widespread across the country, provide the key ingredient for the drug ephedrine. Afghan methamphetamine is produced mainly in the western province of Herat and trafficked out of Afghanistan to neighbouring countries and elsewhere in Central Asia. As with heroin, many poor Afghans rely on methamphetamine production to generate income, especially in Ghourian, where nearly all households are involved in the trade. Emerging evidence indicates that Afghan methamphetamine is also supplied around the world, suggesting that, with continued growth, the market has the potential to rival the country\u2019s heroin trade. ##&& The cocaine market in Afghanistan is almost non-existent, but the illicit cannabis trade, an important source of income for Afghan farmers, remains highly pervasive. A significant proportion of the cannabis produced in Afghanistan is consumed domestically, sold most in the form of garda power. However, considerable volumes reach other external markets, including European markets. Huge volumes of hashish are also trafficked into Pakistan and Iran, often shipped alongside opium or, occasionally, heroin.","text - criminal actors":"Loose and decentralized criminal networks operate in all Afghanistan\u2019s criminal markets. Many of these networks have links to corrupt state-embedded actors and other high-level political figures, as well as to warlords, insurgent groups, terrorist groups and foreign criminals. Corrupt state-embedded actors thus facilitate elite involvement in organized crime, also wielding much influence over Afghanistan\u2019s democratic process. Almost half of all parliamentarians are thought to have connections to the illicit drug trade and other smuggling industries. Criminal networks are the main (non-state) drivers of organized crime in Afghanistan, controlling markets for arms and human trafficking. Although they also operate across the country, due to links with counterparts in neighbouring countries these networks are most active along the Afghan borderlands. ##&& Many politically motivated actors in Afghanistan, including various warlords, the Taliban and ISIL-Khorasan, exhibit characteristics of mafia-style groups. While mafia-style players such as the Taliban dominate Afghanistan\u2019s heroin and illicit mining markets, the extent of their involvement in other criminal markets remains unknown. Mafia-style groups tend to be self-financed through taxation, have access to sophisticated weaponry, wield substantial control over territory, and cause high levels of violence. Many state-embedded actors also exhibit mafia-style tendencies. With the exception of Iranian participants in the methamphetamine market in Herat province, foreign actors do not control any of Afghanistan\u2019s criminal markets. However, foreign criminal influence in some regions and markets is, nonetheless, substantial.","text - leadership and governance":"Afghanistan has an adequate legal framework covering a number of forms of organized crime, including human trafficking, drug trafficking and environmental crimes. Furthermore, the country has ratified all relevant treaties and conventions related to organized crime, with the exception of the Arms Trade Treaty. However, lack of political will means that enforcement is a significant challenge. Rampant corruption severely restricts the rule of law, making Afghanistan one of the world\u2019s most fragile states. Despite expressed intentions to combat organized crime and terrorism, the efficacy of the Afghan government\u2019s response has been limited, not least because certain warlords involved in organized crime and human-rights abuses have been appointed to key government positions. As a result, the state is largely captured by organized criminals involved in patronage networks that control and abuse state resources, and many government officials simply lack the political will to crack down on their own criminal enterprises. Anti-corruption institutions are also inefficient, hindered by internal corruption and lack of capacity and political independence, with many anti-corruption officials themselves being involved in Afghanistan\u2019s criminal markets. While the legal framework for public access to information is robust, it is not implemented, and most government institutions lack transparency. ##&& Nevertheless, the Afghan government maintains positive diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries and various international partners, participating in international coalitions such as INTERPOL. Afghanistan has also signed extradition treaties with a number of countries and has, in the past, extradited drug traffickers and warlords. The country is a major recipient of technical assistance and intelligence sharing, and is one of the largest recipient states of development assistance worldwide. Most of this aid is directed at enhancing the Afghan security sector and strengthening law-enforcement capacity. However, much of this aid has been diverted from its original purpose, instead benefiting power brokers, non-state militias, organized criminals and even the Taliban.","text - criminal justice and security":"Corruption runs rampant in Afghanistan\u2019s judicial and law-enforcement systems, and judges are influenced by bribery. Since state-controlled courts are lacking in some regions, many Afghans rely on local dispute-settlement mechanisms such as the shura (consultation). Moreover, a higher level of trust in Taliban-controlled, rather than state-controlled, courts has been reported. Afghan police also lack adequate training and have poor salaries, relying on international donors for funding. Throughout 2020, but in particular in the final few months of the year, lethal attacks on police officers increased, further damaging the already low morale across the Afghan police force. Although special law-enforcement units focused on combating organized crime exist, corruption and lack of political will hinder their efficacy. In addition, public trust in the police is low, and only an estimated half the population perceives the police as acting according to the law. As a result, local counter-insurgent militias play a key role in international stabilization strategies in Afghanistan. However, even these groups are corrupt, and have been accused of involvement in both illegal taxation and local conflict. Against this backdrop, in recent years the Afghan government has increased its efforts to improve its law enforcement capacity, strengthen ties between Afghan police and locals, and cooperate with community-based justice providers. ##&& Prison conditions in the country are poor, with torture, violence, overcrowding, lack of sanitation, food shortages and power cuts all being significant issues. Corrupt prison officials have even been known to embezzle funds intended for improving prison conditions. The Afghan government controls just over half the country\u2019s districts, which leaves the rest either contested or under the control of non-state actors such as the Taliban. In addition, armed opposition and foreign interference from neighbouring countries prevent government efforts at regaining control over all corners of the country. This lack of territorial control is a major impediment to countering organized crime.","text - economic and financial environment":"Afghanistan\u2019s economy significantly expanded after the 2001 NATO invasion, growing nearly five times in size. However, this has done little to improve life for Afghans, with more than half the population living under the national poverty line. The economy\u2019s performance is one of the worst worldwide, with foreign development aid being its main driver of growth. This makes Afghanistan one of the most difficult countries globally in which to do business, and most businesses operate informally. Despite recent government efforts to boost the private sector, the implementation of such programmes has done little to improve the economic environment. ##&& Afghanistan also has among the highest risks of money laundering and terrorist financing worldwide. The country\u2019s anti-money-laundering framework is inefficient, and the national economy is largely cash-based, reliant on criminal markets and driven by corruption. However, Afghanistan\u2019s anti-money-laundering efforts have improved slightly in recent years through the introduction of cash-carrying limits on international flights, as well as more documentation requirements for large bank deposits and wire transfers. Nevertheless, due to the massive size of Afghanistan\u2019s illicit economy, money laundering and reliance on the hawala (money broker) system for regional financial transfers persist.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Afghan government seems to focus on reactive rather than preventative approaches to combating organized crime. Prevention activities in the country concentrate on violent extremism, although this may indirectly extend to various forms of organized crime. Victim-support services are also severely lacking and most existing services are provided by NGOs. State-controlled drug-rehabilitation services are found across the country but most victims treated in these facilities have fallen into relapse. Private rehabilitation centres also treat a limited number of people who use drugs. Afghanistan recently joined the Global Action against Trafficking in Persons and the Smuggling of Migrants initiative, which is expected to result in an increase in support services for human-trafficking victims. However, to date, implementation of the programme remains weak. ##&& Local peace councils established by NGOs have proven successful in reducing local conflict and creating channels for dialogue between local communities, militias and insurgents, alleviating some of the impacts of organized crime. However, formal institutional processes are lacking and the activity of non-state actors in peacebuilding initiatives has been criticized for limiting the government\u2019s capacity to intervene. Afghanistan has one of the worst media environments worldwide and media freedom is severely limited. Attacks on, and assassinations of, journalists \u2013 especially women journalists \u2013 have risen in recent years. Furthermore, human rights defenders are extremely vulnerable to attacks, at least 17 of whom were killed in 2020. Many, if not the majority, of lethal attacks of journalists and human rights defenders are thought to have been carried out by the Taliban.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Kabul","GDP (current $US million)":"19291.10","Income group":"Low income","Population":"38041754","Land Area (sq. km)":"652860","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"102.1","Freedom in the World Index":"27","Human Development Index":"0.51","Global Peace Index":"3.64","Democracy Index":"2.85","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"19","GDP per capita (current US$)":"507","1":"7.08","1.1":"6.90","1.2":"7.25","2":"2.67"},{"Corresp":"8","ISO-3":"ARM","Country":"Armenia","ISO-2":"AM","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Central Asia and the Caucasus","Flag file":"am.png","1.

Allegedly, the ring organizing the trafficking has been operational for at least two decades, involving high-ranking public officials, medical professionals and orphanages. ##&& Compared to global trends, human smuggling is fairly limited in Armenia. On the one hand, foreign nationals may be smuggled into Armenia, where they become vulnerable to trafficking. On the other, Armenian nationals may seek the help of smuggling rings to get out of the country in pursuit of employment elsewhere, mainly in Russia, Turkey and the UAE.

Most arms trafficking incidents in the country are isolated and occurred before the 2018 Velvet Revolution. The long territorial dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region was a reason for increased legal arms imports, especially during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. Many of the arms and aid could potentially be diverted into the illegal arena, as has happened before, or nurture an illicit arms market in the region, where governmental control is weak. Currently, however, domestic demand is limited.","text - environment":"Illicit logging in Armenia is prevalent along the border with Azerbaijan, where heightened insecurity lowers investment prospects. Locally, illicitly harvested timber is used as firewood and in furniture manufacturing. Organized-crime groups are known to export timber, mainly to Russia. Despite overall corruption levels falling since 2018, corruption in the logging sector is still problematic. Allegedly, organized crime groups pay off officials to allow loggers to work undisturbed. Deforestation is already having a negative impact, leading to environmental issues such as landslides, floods and destruction of ecosystems. The Armenia\u2013Azerbaijan border regions are also well-known poaching grounds. Although there is an indication that poaching is becoming more organized, there is no information on the types of actors involved. Armenia is, however, known to be a transit country for wildlife trafficked between Asia, Africa and Europe. The country is also part of a caviar-smuggling corridor, running from Azerbaijan through Armenia into Russia and the EU. In addition to facilitating illicit logging, corruption is central to a number of other illicit activities that affect the environment, among them wildlife trafficking and mining. Officials reportedly use fraudulent Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) permits to import rare animal species to keep as pets, and high-ranking officials have allegedly abused state-issued permits and conspired with foreign companies to benefit from mining activities in the country. After decades of entrenched corruption, however, vested interests in the sector have been overcome. Following the revolution, the government came down on companies involved in illicit gold extraction and the criminal market for non-renewable resources in the country has subsequently shrunk.","text - drugs":"Armenia is predominately a transit country for the heroin trade, forming part of the northern route linking Afghanistan, Iran, the Caucasus and Europe. Armenian organized crime groups are involved in the trade, but mostly Russian and Iranian actors organize the supply and cross-border transit. Evidence indicates that the Meghri crossing on the Armenia\u2013Iran border is where most of the heroin supply enters the country; it is subsequently transported to the Armenia\u2013Georgia border. However, domestic heroin consumption in Armenia remains limited, as prices have allegedly risen in recent years. Armenia is also a transit point for cocaine trafficking operations between Latin America, Turkey and Europe, as well as Iran, the UAE and Malaysia. However, cocaine trafficking through Armenia, which mostly involves foreign actors, is believed to have been on the decline in recent years, and domestic demand is low. ##&& Indoor cannabis production seems widely prevalent in Armenia, with organized-crime networks involved in distributing cannabis in the country and trafficking it abroad. While Armenian groups are known to be involved in the production and export of methamphetamine to larger markets, such as Australia, Armenia is mostly a transit country for synthetic drugs. Predominantly Iranian groups are involved in the trade, with synthetic drugs destined for larger markets coming in from Iran.","text - criminal actors":"State-embedded actors seem to be the most influential criminal type in Armenia, but their overall influence is limited. For the most part, due to the inability of state actors to monopolize specific markets, they tend to collude with criminal actors and facilitate organized crime. Additionally, corruption levels and the involvement of state-embedded actors in criminality have decreased following the revolution. Foreign players are also engaged in criminal activities in Armenia. For the most part, these are Iranian groups involved in the trafficking of heroin, synthetic drugs and, to a lesser extent, cocaine, and Russian companies working with state-embedded actors to exploit non-renewable resources. ##&& There are indications of mafia-style groups divided into clans or brotherhoods (akhperutyuns), controlling parts of the capital, Yerevan. In the post-revolution period, however, membership has significantly declined and clan leaders have either reduced their criminal activities or fled to Russia. Historically, thieves in law (vory v zakone) have been active in Armenia, although their influence has declined since the early 2000s and experts no longer consider them mafia-style groups but rather criminal networks. Instead, mafia groups are more active outside the country, primarily in Russia. A small number of thieves in law remain in Armenia but they maintain connections with Georgian and Russian networks as well as with former members in Turkey and the UAE. They exert some influence over the prison population in Armenia. They were allegedly linked to high-ranking state officials but it is believed that these ties were severed in the post-revolution period. It is likely that other organized-criminal networks also operate in Armenia, but their influence over criminal markets is not considerable.","text - leadership and governance":"Before the revolution, Armenia resembled a semi-dictatorship; it has since made considerable progress. The new government adopted an ambitious programme of reforms, prioritizing rule of law and anti-corruption, among other key areas. It established the Anti-Corruption Policy Council and, in addition to an anti-corruption drive, it stepped up its anti-drug-trafficking efforts. These reforms have resulted in increased transparency and public trust in institutions and have been recognized by the international community as positive developments. In spite of the progress made, the country still lacks effective anti-corruption measures. As a result, state-embedded corruption and organized crime remain problematic. In addition, the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute has created tension between Armenia and Azerbaijan, with the latest conflict turning into a full-scale war. The region is also a reason for the long-term fragility and vulnerability of the country \u2013 politically, economically and in terms of security. ##&& Armenia is party to most relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, with the exception of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, and the Arms Trade Treaty. The country collaborates closely on matters of justice and security with a number of state and non-state actors, including Russia and other former Soviet republics, EU member states, Georgia, Iran, the US and China. Although Armenia\u2019s legal framework covers most criminal markets of interest to this Index, further efforts are necessary to strengthen the country\u2019s relevant legislation. The anti-corruption reforms and the legislation criminalizing criminal subcultures and their leaders are all positive steps, although some political resistance has been encountered.","text - criminal justice and security":"The government that came after the 2018 revolution has recognized that a transparent and independent judicial system is a critical element of governance. In an attempt to overhaul the judicial branch, a new strategy for judicial and legal reform was drafted in jointly with civil society and international organizations. The top-to-bottom reforms and their implementation, although not complete, have generally received positive assessment, but courts reportedly still lack independence and institutions are weakened by corruption. To rectify that, there is a significant focus on anti-corruption, with Armenia announcing plans to establish three anti-corruption investigative bodies by 2021. Problems in the prison system, on the other hand, persist. Allegedly, criminal subcultures rule prisons; following the introduction of the bill criminalizing criminal subcultures, riots broke out in many prisons across the country. Reports also indicate prisoner abuse and poor living conditions in the penitentiary system, including understaffed and poorly equipped medical facilities. Measures to strengthen healthcare and human rights in prisons have been taken in collaboration with the EU. Historically, law enforcement agencies have not been among the most trusted institutions in the country. Limited state funding and low salaries have made bribes more tempting. However, with the new government coming into power, reforms were implemented in law enforcement as well. Anti-organized crime units were restructured and high-profile arrests were made, including of local crime bosses. Nevertheless, as it is at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, Armenia remains an important hub for transnational organized crime activities. Although Armenia\u2019s borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan have been closed since 1993, the borders with Georgia and Iran are exposed and vulnerable to drug trafficking operations. The Nagorno-Karabakh region was another source of territorial vulnerability in 2020. While Armenia maintains domestic control of its law enforcement operations, there are Russian border guards along the country's borders with Turkey and Iran, as well as Russian immigration staff at international airports in Yerevan and Gyumri.","text - economic and financial environment":"Armenia has improved its anti-money laundering (AML) framework over recent years and has made progress in money-laundering risk and threat assessment. There is a financial intelligence unit within Armenia\u2019s Central Bank, the Financial Monitoring Centre, which is tasked with the implementation and enforcement of the AML mechanism. In spite of the improvements, especially following the revolution, Armenia does not meet international standards, and risk of money laundering and terrorist financing is still considered high. Despite the government adopting an ambitious programme focusing on economic reforms, in 2019 half the workforce in Armenia was employed in the informal sector and is at risk of abuse and\/or exploitation. Nevertheless, the programme aims to improve transparency in business, increase investments and develop tourism, as well as exports. Currently, the economic regulatory environment is conducive to doing business in the country.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Armenian government has increased its protection efforts for victims of human trafficking and forced labour but there is no witness protection programme. Arguably, since 2018, the government has not paid attention to improving victim and witness support, and law enforcement officials reportedly lack the training and sensitivity needed to assist victims. There is an NGO-run victim protection shelter that offers victims of organized crime legal, medical and psychological assistance. Other NGOs in Armenia also give legal assistance to victims, and the government provides free healthcare. In terms of prevention, Armenia has approved a national action plan to reduce the trafficking of human beings. Armenia also ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse in 2020. The country developed strategies against corruption and money laundering, including launching an online whistle-blower protection platform where individuals can report crime and\/or corruption. In spite of lack of funding for NGOs, Armenia has a vibrant civil society sector. NGOs were part of the revolution and have subsequently been more involved in discussion and decision making. The media landscape improved considerably in the wake of the revolution, but independence of journalists and transparency in media ownership are still major issues in the country. Throughout the 2018 protests, small media outlets not affiliated with political or corporate entities provided counternarratives to the discourse proposed by mainstream state-sponsored outlets. However, to this day, independent journalists report that they employ self-censorship as a means of avoiding harassment.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Yerevan","GDP (current $US million)":"13672.80","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"2957731","Land Area (sq. km)":"29740","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"69.8","Freedom in the World Index":"55","Human Development Index":"0.78","Global Peace Index":"2.14","Democracy Index":"5.35","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"49","GDP per capita (current US$)":"4623","1":"3.27","1.1":"3.40","1.2":"3.13","2":"5.71"},{"Corresp":"11","ISO-3":"AZE","Country":"Azerbaijan","ISO-2":"AZ","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Central Asia and the Caucasus","Flag file":"az.png","1.

Women are particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation, while men are most likely to be victimized in forced labour. Both male and female victims are trafficked domestically and abroad, usually to Russia, Turkey and the UAE. Although to a lesser extent, children are also victimized, predominately through forced labour and begging. The Azerbaijani government apparently has some established practices that resemble exploitation, such as civil servants being forced to participate in the cotton harvest under threat of their jobs \u2013 as well as those of their families \u2013 being terminated. Foreign nationals from China, Russia and other former Soviet republics are also victims of trafficking in Azerbaijan and are, in most cases, exploited sexually and through forced labour. Filipino women are reportedly vulnerable to domestic servitude. ##&& Human smuggling dynamics in Azerbaijan are such that the country is mostly a source and transit point for irregular migration. Azerbaijani nationals often use the services of human smugglers to make their way to the EU. Foreign nationals from across the Middle East, Central and South-eastern Asia, on the other hand, are smuggled through Azerbaijan on their way to Russia, Georgia and Turkey, or onward to Europe. Reports also indicate that Azerbaijan is a transit country on a less common smuggling route between south-west Asia and the EU, along which irregular migrants, mostly Afghani nationals, use fraudulent documents rather than clandestine border-crossing strategies.","text - trade":"For the past three decades, the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region was a source of tension between Armenia and Azerbaijan, a situation that escalated into full-scale war in 2020. Although arms trafficking is reportedly extremely limited in Azerbaijan, increased legal arms imports to both countries could possibly nurture an illicit market.","text - environment":"Flora crimes are, for the most part, not an issue in Azerbaijan, although illicit logging does occur. Notably, mostly locals, rather than organized crime groups, are involved. Azerbaijan hosts a large illicit caviar trade. Caviar sourced in the country is smuggled through Georgia and Turkey into the EU, mainly by land borders, and sold as counterfeit Russian caviar. Most of Azerbaijani revenue comes from oil and gas extraction, a sector riddled with corruption. Along with enabling the bribery of officials, the sector has allowed Azerbaijani heads of state to sustain patronage networks, which in turn uphold the regime. Many organized crime groups in Azerbaijan take advantage of the lax commercial transportation system in the region and engage in oil theft, subsequently smuggling oil to neighbouring countries.","text - drugs":"Azerbaijan appears to be the main transit point for heroin and opium trafficked from Iran and Afghanistan to Russia and the EU. Opium enters Azerbaijan primarily through the country\u2019s southern border with Iran and some of it is processed for domestic and regional consumption. A significant domestic demand exists in Azerbaijan. Beyond news of sporadic seizures of cocaine, little information is available on trafficking, which suggests that the cocaine trade in the country is very limited. ##&& Cannabis is grown locally to supply the domestic demand, but the drug has been exported abroad as well. The most likely destinations for Azerbaijani cannabis are Eastern and Central Europe. Since 2013, however, larger quantities of Azerbaijani cannabis have been seized across the southern Caucasus, indicating a possible overall escalation of cannabis originating in Azerbaijan. Similar to its role in the heroin trade, the country is a major transit country for synthetic drugs, especially methamphetamine, coming from Iran and destined for Russia. In recent years, a significant increase in trafficking of synthetic drugs from Iran into Azerbaijan has been observed.","text - criminal actors":"The repressive and authoritarian government of Azerbaijan, along with the unaccountable, resource-based economy, has contributed to high levels of corruption, which permeates state institutions and obstructs reform. The dominant network, controlled by President Ilham Aliyev and his family, is engaged in political corruption and organized crime to such an extent that the lines between the two are blurred. This network provides patronage to businesses in return for economic gain. Given the overreliance of the Azerbaijani economy on oil and gas extraction, state-embedded actors are for the most part active in that sector. Corrupt officials allegedly influence the democratic processes through pervasive ideological reinforcement, severely restricting the civil and political rights of Azerbaijanis. Stemming from the prominence of state-embedded actors in Azerbaijan and the control they exert, the influence of mafia-style groups in Azerbaijan is, arguably, fairly modest. Limited information points towards the existence of a single mafia-style group, Cig\u00e1nska mafia, which allegedly has a large membership but whose structure is unknown. The group is supposedly engaged in heroin trafficking and caviar smuggling as well as extortion, arms trafficking and human trafficking. In spite of open-source information on the organization, further research is needed to corroborate the group\u2019s existence. ##&& There is little evidence to indicate that any foreign diaspora in Azerbaijan solely exert control specific criminal market in the country, as most criminally active foreign nationals are members of larger local organized crime groups. Foreign actors, on the other hand, play a large role in Azerbaijan\u2019s organized crime markets, with reports of involvement in sex, labour and drug trafficking operations. Azerbaijani criminal networks also engage in a range of criminal operations, mostly on a domestic level. These groups are also known to participate in cross-border heroin and opiate trafficking with Russian groups, their joint operations running from the southern to the northern Caucasus. Domestic networks are likely to have ties to other groups in Turkey, Iran and the EU as well. Besides heroin, Azerbaijani criminal networks increasingly traffic cannabis across the southern Caucasus.","text - leadership and governance":"Azerbaijan\u2019s mountainous terrain and strategic positioning at the crossroads of continents make it a prime location for transnational organized crime operations. In particular, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict makes the Azerbaijan\u2013Armenia borderlands an international hub for various forms of trafficking and smuggling. Yet, political leadership does not demonstrate a real will to combat organized crime. On the contrary, clientelism and patronage persist and are the power base of the authoritarian regime of the Aliyev family and their close circle. Reports suggest that a vertical integration of corruption networks exists in Azerbaijan, where bribes collected as fake fines at the street level are sent upward, pooled together and then distributed down the chain as \u2018envelope salaries\u2019, as they are commonly known. Although the legal framework guiding public access to information is sound, there are apparent transparency issues, with actual access to information being highly restricted. ##&& Azerbaijan is party to all relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, with the exception of the Arms Trade Treaty. In addition, it has signed several extradition treaties, as well as a collaborative agreement with Iran to enhance border security and intelligence sharing in an effort to combat drug smuggling along the Azerbaijan\u2013Iran border. Overall, there has been an increased cooperation between law enforcement agencies in Azerbaijan and their Western counterparts, especially in the field of counter narcotics. National policies and laws are also adequately equipped to tackle cross-border offences. Although it lacks provisions on whistle-blowing, the anti-corruption framework is adequate. Implementation is, however, lacking.","text - criminal justice and security":"Given the ubiquity of corruption across the state apparatus, the judicial system in Azerbaijan is also highly prone to corruption, with low salaries being a major driver. The executive branch controls promotions and appointments in the judicial system, undermining its work, and uses it to persecute defenders of human rights. As a result, a number of international organizations have condemned the judicial system as corrupt and unwilling to implement meaningful reforms aimed at breaking the status quo. An assessment of treatment of people in custody and conditions of detention has implicated Azerbaijan\u2019s temporary detention centre for combating organized crime in potential illegal activities or abuse. The country has functioning anti-organized crime units: the main directorate for combatting organized crime, the main drug enforcement department and the main department on the fight against human trafficking. Nevertheless, lack of sufficient knowledge and training to tackle organized crime, particularly human trafficking, has been identified as an issue in law enforcement, especially outside the capital. First responders fail to follow standard operating procedures or to identify victims of trafficking, thereby limiting their own investigative capacities and their ability to assist victims. Yet, Azerbaijan\u2019s geographical positioning at the crossroads of Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East, and its shared borders with Iran \u2013 one of the world\u2019s major drug transit routes \u2013 renders the country highly vulnerable to trafficking. Moreover, disputes with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region complicate territorial sovereignty and limit Azerbaijan\u2019s capacity to secure its borders against organized crime.","text - economic and financial environment":"Azerbaijan\u2019s weak currency and poorly monitored financial sector, as well as its close proximity to organized crime operations in Afghanistan, Iran and Russia, create a fertile environment for money laundering operations. While some improvements were made to the anti-money laundering framework, the government has failed to implement the measures. Thus, risk of money laundering and terrorist financing in Azerbaijan is relatively high. Due to the prevalence of bribery, costs to businesses continue to skyrocket. Issues of monopoly cartels, questionable state tenders and procurement fraud as well as poor enforcement of market competition regulations have all posted setbacks for the country\u2019s regulatory environment. The business climate in the country, however, is somewhat conducive to doing business because of recent economic achievements and efforts to ease administrative procedures.","text - civil society and social protection":"In spite of a number of positive developments in victim support, Azerbaijan has not increased overall protection efforts. This is evident in the lack of proactive victim identification, and the failure of the government to approve the 2019\u20132023 national action plan. The ministry of internal affairs has established shelters to assist trafficking victims, providing accommodation as well as financial, legal, medical and psychosocial assistance. Two operational victim assistance centres \u2013 in Baku and Goychay \u2013 also provide support and employment assistance to officially identified and potential victims of organized crime, with reports boasting efficient reintegration services and cooperation with civil society. On a range of organized crime issues, prevention has been limited to seminars and campaigns to raise awareness. The media situation in the country is dire. The state closely monitors the work of media outlets and subjects journalists and\/or bloggers who are critical of the government to harassment, extortion and physical attacks, as well as to detention. Regardless of that sort of treatment, journalists have successfully shed light on illicit activities. NGOs also face considerable obstacles in registering and functioning in Azerbaijan, and allegedly fail to create impact without government cooperation. Critical foreign and domestic NGOs have reportedly had their assets frozen and their offices raided, with pressure coming from repressive laws enacted by the authoritarian government. Similar to journalists, activists are also harassed, intimidated and detained.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Baku","GDP (current $US million)":"48047.65","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"10024283","Land Area (sq. km)":"86600","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"75.1","Freedom in the World Index":"10","Human Development Index":"0.76","Global Peace Index":"2.30","Democracy Index":"2.68","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"30","GDP per capita (current US$)":"4793","1":"5.08","1.1":"4.15","1.2":"6.00","2":"4.08"},{"Corresp":"13","ISO-3":"BHR","Country":"Bahrain","ISO-2":"BH","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Western Asia","Flag file":"bh.png","1.

This, coupled with the lack of minimum wage regulations, makes the country a primary destination for human trafficking and forced labour in particular. Other forms of exploitation, such as forced prostitution, sexual abuse, non-payment of wages and restrictions on freedom of movement, also occur. Migrants, predominately from Southern and South-eastern Asia as well as Africa, typically enter Bahrain legally in search of high-paying jobs, but subsequently fall into modern slavery. The Kafala system \u2013 tying migrant workers to their employers (sponsors) \u2013 further exacerbates the risk of migrant workers falling victim to modern slavery. Most of the foreign workers in Bahrain are Bangladeshis, but the number of workers from African countries is on the rise. African nations do not for the most part have a diplomatic presence in Bahrain, which further increases the risk of trafficking for their citizens. ##&& The smuggling of migrants into Bahrain is not as salient an issue as in other countries in the Gulf, largely due to the country\u2019s location near more prominent smuggling destinations like Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as well as the fact that it incentivizes migrant labour and has naturalization policies. But instances of such smuggling do occur. Human traffickers use big events in Bahrain, such as Formula 1 races \u2013 for which travellers holding race tickets are granted two-week tourist visas \u2013 to allegedly smuggle people into the country and then exploit them. Additionally, there have been a few incidents of young Saudi men entering Bahrain irregularly with their female partners, but these are likely individual attempts rather than any form of organized smuggling networks.","text - trade":"Trafficking of arms is reportedly an issue, although its extent is unknown. Allegedly, foreign actors sponsored by the Iranian Quds Force traffic weapons into Bahrain. Experts, however, believe that this has not been a pressing security issue since the mid-1990s, but rather a pretext for the government to suppress political unrest in Bahrain. In recent years, reports of arms trafficking into Bahrain have decreased, but it is arguable whether this reflects a genuine decrease in trafficking, or the displacement of activity to less detectable routes. Bahrain exempts all military procurement from public tender and does not in any way regulate the use of intermediaries in procurement, which is a prerequisite for defence corruption.","text - environment":"There have been occasional reports of the smuggling of flora products into Bahrain, such as agarwood and bacteria-infected olive trees, but overall, Bahrain\u2019s role in the transnational flora-related criminal market is limited. Conversely, Bahrain is both a destination and, to a lesser extent, transit country for illegal wildlife products. In fact, the country is one of the largest destination markets for illegally trafficked African grey parrots. Instances of the smuggling of animals from abandoned zoos and breeding stations in Syria into Bahrain have also been documented. While Bahrain is not an oil-rich nation, oil theft does occur in the country. Reports describe a network of thieves, comprising both domestic and foreign actors, stealing oil from company trucks and then smuggling it to countries where prices are higher. However, the volume of oil theft remains fairly low. In 2018 Bahrain made its largest hydrocarbon discovery to date, which might increase oil theft, smuggling and bunkering. Smuggling of small quantities of gold and diamonds has also been reported, but there is no indication of the involvement of organized crime groups.","text - drugs":"The domestic heroin market is small, primarily due the stigmatization of heroin use. Based on seizure reports, however, Bahrain appears to be a prominent transit country for heroin. There is little information available about the cocaine market in Bahrain, where cocaine consumption and trade appear to be considerably less significant than cannabis and synthetic drugs. Most likely, high prices limit cocaine availability to more well-off parts of society. ##&& Bahrain is a destination country for cannabis, but also plays a role as a transit state, albeit to a lesser extent. The primary source countries for cannabis are Saudi Arabia and Iran, but the region is also supplied by North African countries like Egypt. Although domestic cannabis consumption is low, cannabis trade is among the largest drug markets in Bahrain. The country is also popular with Saudi nationals wishing to experiment with alcohol and drugs, including cannabis. It is reasonable to suggest that most cannabis comes into Bahrain via the King Fahd Causeway, and it is also smuggled from Iran across the Gulf by boat. The synthetic drug trade is considerable, with Bahrain being a destination for methamphetamine, Captagon and other synthetic drugs. Methamphetamine is largely imported through Bahrain International Airport and comes from South-eastern Asia, Malaysia and Thailand in particular. Meanwhile, Captagon enters Bahrain through Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. While the use of methamphetamine seems to be increasing throughout the region, it is arguably the highest in Bahrain, especially among young people.","text - criminal actors":"There are no indications of the existence of domestic mafia-style groups in Bahrain. Foreign criminal groups, however, do appear to operate on Bahraini territory and are particularly influential in methamphetamine and synthetic-drug trafficking in general. These actors are mainly from other Asian countries and smuggle drugs into Bahrain through foreign actors who live in the country. Whereas cannabis arriving from Saudi Arabia is usually smuggled by Saudi or Bahraini individuals in small networks of two to three people, cannabis coming from Iran tends to be sourced from larger, professionalized and more organized foreign networks. Iranian groups are allegedly smuggling arms for opposition groups in Bahrain. Furthermore, Bahrain has recently become a popular place to settle for individuals with links to organized crime, with notable cases including alleged organized criminal actors from the Republic of Ireland and India, among others. ##&& Many criminal networks in Bahrain reportedly have a mixed membership of both Bahraini and foreign nationals. They are active primarily in the distribution of drugs in Bahrain, having ties to foreign actors. Small groups are also involved in the theft and smuggling of oil from Bahrain to neighbouring states. Criminal networks are seldom armed and rarely, if ever, engage in violence. Very limited evidence suggests state involvement in organized crime activity in Bahrain. Although organized crime actors are unlikely to have infiltrated the state apparatus, the monarchy provides patronage to a small group of supporters, particularly within the security sector, in order to protect its authority. Perceived corruption among the elite in Bahrain was one of the main drivers of the popular uprising in 2011 and in the following decade the late Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa cracked down on opposition and removed many oversight mechanisms, allowing corruption to thrive. While improvements have been made over the past few years, corruption remains a pertinent issue.","text - leadership and governance":"Levels of organized crime in Bahrain are fairly low, which partly explains why the issue of organized crime does not feature strongly on the country\u2019s political agenda. Nevertheless, the government continues to make efforts to combat organized crime, particularly in the area of human trafficking. However, Bahrain has experienced considerable instability since the 2011 anti-government protests. The country is an authoritarian state, with the royal family maintaining absolute control. An anti-corruption framework does exist, but it is poorly enforced and reports suggest that the situation has deteriorated over the past decade (although improvements have seemingly been made in the last few years). Access to information is not guaranteed by law, which makes transparency an issue, especially as far as the work of high-level officials is concerned. ##&& Bahrain is party to most relevant international treaties pertaining to organized crime, with the exception of the United Nations Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition. Bahrain also works within and hosts many international anti-organized crime bodies and forums. Most recently, the kingdom signed an agreement with the UNODC to establish a regional centre of excellence for capacity building in the area of combating trafficking in people. In line with the country\u2019s international anti-organized crime commitments, Bahrain has a robust legislative framework, especially compared to some of its Gulf counterparts. A national anti-trafficking action plan was approved for the 2019\u20132023 period, but the Kafala system continues to attract international criticism. In an effort to reduce labour crimes, Bahrain became the first Gulf Cooperation Council country to pass legislation for a flexible work permit, aiming to reduce the vulnerability of migrant workers to trafficking. Moreover, in 2020, the government introduced new legislation criminalizing the trade in protected animal and plant species.","text - criminal justice and security":"There are no specialized anti-organized crime units within the judicial system. Instead, such cases are handled by either civil law courts or the Court of Cassation. Decisions are rarely swayed by bribes or other forms of payment, but political pressure puts court independence into question. The judicial system is under the control of a member of the royal family \u2013 a fact that is often used to either manipulate or intimidate the opposition. Prison conditions have been deteriorating since 2011, when military trials for civilians and the revoking of Bahraini citizenship were introduced. As overcrowding, torture, abuse and medical negligence persist, security officers commit human rights violations with impunity. The situation has become of great concern for the international community. Bahrain is one of the most heavily policed states in the world. There are anti-organized crime units that predominately target drug trafficking. Potential indicators that may signal human trafficking, however, are handled administratively, as are labour violations. While there is nothing to suggest that law enforcement officers engage in organized crime, they are known to carry out systemic human rights abuses with impunity. Overwhelming evidence suggests that members of law enforcement have committed torture, arbitrary detention, sexual assault and other human rights violations. As an island nation, Bahrain is less vulnerable to organized crime activities.","text - economic and financial environment":"Bahraini authorities recognize the money laundering and terrorist financing risks the country faces and have made efforts to bolster their resilience against the threat of money laundering. There is a financial intelligence unit in the country that is reportedly effective in its work, as well as a strong anti-money laundering framework in place. Nevertheless, further legislative improvements are needed and the risk of money laundering in the country remains moderate. The Bahraini economic environment is conducive to doing business while providing safeguards against the risks of illegal business penetrating the legal economy. However, a significant proportion of the labour force operates informally.","text - civil society and social protection":"Bahrain is the first country in the Middle East and North Africa region to establish an assistance fund for the victims of human trafficking, which pays for essential services for victims and supports them financially in reintegrating themselves into their home countries or while they are seeking employment in Bahrain. Additionally, there is a government-operated protection centre, which shelters vulnerable workers and victims of trafficking, offering medical, security and legal services, as well as counselling. Despite the Kafala system being recognized as a risk factor in pushing migrant workers into modern slavery, it is illegal for migrants to flee abusive employers. In terms of prevention, Bahrain introduced legislation for a flexible work permit in an attempt to reduce the vulnerability of migrant workers to modern slavery. There are a number of drug rehabilitation centres in the country, run by NGOs. The primary focus of NGOs in Bahrain appears to be corruption and human rights. Although civil society is subject to heavy regulations and intimidation in some instances, the sector is active, largely due to the dramatic deterioration in the human rights situation in the country. The media in Bahrain is also heavily constrained. All broadcast media outlets are government owned, while the country\u2019s main newspapers are owned by individuals with ties to the state. Following the 2011 Arab Spring, drastic censorship measures were taken and since then many journalists have been jailed.

Human trafficking is driven primarily by the exploitation of children for sexual purposes, domestic servitude and labour exploitation. Brothel owners use phantom debt schemes to tie victims into prostitution and maintain control over them. Complicit law-enforcement officials are paid to produce legitimate prostitution licences indicating the victim\u2019s willingness to engage in sex work. Victims are lured abroad with false promises of high-paying work, and are subsequently kidnapped, drugged and sold into prostitution. Besides sex and labour trafficking, organ trafficking is widespread in Bangladesh. ##&& Bangladesh\u2019s human smuggling market runs parallel to its human trafficking market, with significant numbers of Bangladeshi nationals moving within the region and to Gulf countries. The practice, which mainly targets women, children and vulnerable Rohingya refugees, is run by organized criminal groups and state-embedded actors. Rohingya refugees are particularly vulnerable due to lack of education, employment and resources. Organized criminal networks have been established between Bangladesh, Thailand and Myanmar, and there are highly efficient systems for smuggling people across the border into India using fraudulently obtained identity documents. Human smuggling leads to significant local violence, and mass grave sites have been found along the borders of Bangladesh and across South and South-eastern Asia. Corruption among local authorities and ruling-party leaders is significant in enabling the smuggling market to operate.","text - trade":"Bangladesh is a transit country for illicit weapons, with its own domestic market. The market is particularly concentrated in Cox\u2019s Bazar, which is a strategic location for arms smugglers to reach India and Nepal. Numerous mafia-style groups in neighbouring countries utilize Bangladesh as a transit point for arms trafficking, and the trade is heavily linked with armed operations in India, Nepal and Myanmar. Left- and right-wing extremists, Islamist terrorist organizations and criminal organizations fuel significant market demand. Arms shipments in and out of Chittagong and Cox\u2019s Bazar are enabled by corruption in the form of payments to the Bangladeshi coastguard. The local trade caters for individuals looking for protection against mistrusted local authorities, with clandestine shops on Moheshkhali Island existing solely for this purpose. Local trade also serves members of the political elite within mainstream parties to maintain their armed cadres.","text - environment":"It is difficult to measure the extent of the illicit flora market in Bangladesh, but it is thought to be heavily driven by local demand for resources. Categories of the major flora crimes present in Bangladesh include illegal felling, forestland encroachment and deliberate fire setting. Timber smuggling appears to be the most profitable illicit trade, with trees felled illegally in the forests near Khulna and Chittagong, and smuggled to India and Myanmar. ##&& ##&& Bangladesh is increasingly functioning as a transit country for illegal fauna, especially from India\u2019s growing fauna-crimes market moving contraband through Bangladesh to richer economies, with criminal rackets near the border in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh dominating the trade. Bangladesh is also a transit country for exotic animals destined for China and Thailand. Tiger poaching isa concern, as Bangladesh is home to 2.7% of the global tiger population. Despite conflicting reports from forest officials and conservationists, tiger-poaching numbers appear to below. Finally, Bangladesh hosts a significant fisheries-crime market, fuelled in part by the fear of imminent extinction of fish species that the poorest in Bangladesh rely on for their livelihoods. The fact that Bangladesh produces more than 2.8 million tonnes of fish annually raises concerns about the likelihood of illegal fishing, which seems to be significantly greater in Bangladesh than in neighbouring countries. ##&& ##&& Although Bangladesh is known to poorly manage its non-renewable natural resources \u2013 including rich reserves of coal, gas, oil and minerals \u2013 there is little evidence to suggest an organized criminal market. However, illicit sand mining is widespread, especially at Tangail near the Dhaleswari River, where it has proved very difficult for local officials to disrupt this activity owing to the high-level contacts the miners rely on. The degradation of land, biodiversity, and especially natural gas, is concerning, especially as many poor rural Bangladeshis' livelihoods depend on natural resources.","text - drugs":"Close to the Golden Crescent \u2013 where most of the world\u2019s heroin is produced \u2013 Bangladesh is a well-placed conduit for the heroin trade. India is the primary producer of the heroin transported through Bangladesh, with criminal networks cooperating across its porous border and Chittagong as the primary departure point for heroin on its way to key markets in Southern Asia and the UK. The heroin trade is a large criminal market in Bangladesh and is facilitated by loose criminal and mafia-style groups, often taking advantage of poor children, who are used as drug dealers and runners. There is an alarming amount of sophistication in the heroin trade, as export companies transporting it appear to have legitimate licences and tax-identification numbers issued by Bangladeshi authorities. While the trade fuels conflict and violence, it stays primarily within rival crime gangs and networks. ##&& The synthetic-drug trade is one of Bangladesh's largest criminal and local markets, with most profits being accrued domestically. The smuggling of precursor drugs and chemicals is primarily across the border from India, and Myanmar has increasingly been using Bangladesh as a transit and destination country, primarily smuggling yaba (a methamphetamine-based stimulant) through Teknaf, assisted by paid-off junior members of Border Guards Bangladesh. The displaced Rohingya refugees are increasingly recruited as drug mules, and despite the government\u2019s zero-tolerance policy towards yaba, the market has grown alarmingly, as evidenced by the monumental increase in seizures in recent years. ##&& Bangladesh is believed to have the largest cannabis trade in Southern Asia after India, acting primarily as a transit route. Cannabis often enters the country from India at Comilla, though it is also widely cultivated across Bangladesh, with the railways being the favoured mode of domestic transport. Vulnerable children are often forced to become drug dealers due to their desperate financial circumstances. Demand stems primarily from foreign economies, and recreational cannabis use within Bangladesh remains low compared to neighbouring countries. Bangladesh is primarily a transit route for the larger regional cocaine trade, with international cartels seeing the country\u2019s ports as a \u2018safe route\u2019 for smuggling into Europe and South-eastern Asia, due to Bangladesh\u2019s lack of detention facilities and outdated detection equipment.","text - criminal actors":"The mafia-style groups prevalent across Bangladesh are known as mastan, and are deeply embedded in the political and social infrastructure of the country, having authority over large areas and controlling public services and employment opportunities. They operate across numerous criminal markets, and often use street children as \u2018illicit labourers\u2019 to commit crime and violence. However, there are reports that the role of mastan groups is in decline, with gang activities falling under the control of the ruling party. Criminal networks in Bangladesh are large and ambiguous. While the mastan groups have created criminal networks of gangs to conduct their activities at local level, there are other gangs with international criminal linkages from Southern Asia and in Pacific countries. Alliances have also been formed between criminal networks and extremist groups, and there is widespread concern about youth involvement in gangs across Bangladesh due to lack of social infrastructure and opportunities. Poverty and a lack of employment opportunity, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, allows criminal gangs to flourish, in particular by recruiting young children to their ranks. ##&& Corruption is widespread in Bangladesh, with poor levels of government transparency and accountability. Political actors collude with criminal actors. Criminal actors are known to influence democratic processes through state corruption, and some gangs are under the patronage of the two rival parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh National Party. However, aside from Rohingya refugees being coerced into participating in organized criminal activity, there is little evidence of foreign actors' involvement in Bangladeshi criminal markets.","text - leadership and governance":"The Bangladeshi government is severely lacking in accountability and transparency, with politicians and law-enforcement officials being closely linked to criminal actors. Human rights violations remain at a high level, and the government has ignored pressure to legislate in this area, instead enacting legislation to prevent criticism of the government and restricting freedom of speech. Since the government announced a war on drugs in 2018, there have been allegations of extrajudicial killings, but security forces have remained protected from prosecution, claiming that these deaths were legitimate, resulting from crossfire. Security forces also employ mass arrests in order to suppress public demonstrations, especially around demands for higher wages and safer working conditions, and bitter political divisions have created space for a re-emergence of jihadist activism. ##&& Over the last decade, Bangladesh has established many anti-corruption laws that have called for greater government transparency, and in 2018 created very strict and punitive laws around the possession and selling of illegal drugs. The country has made great strides in protecting the rights of children, who are often recruited and exploited by criminal gangs; however, it still lacks legislation regarding the prevention of forced child marriage and prostitution. There are other large legislative gaps in Bangladesh in areas such as flora and fauna crime, and non-renewable-resource crime, and although there is legislation against human trafficking it has been poorly enforced. However, due to threats of US sanctions, Dhaka has indicated that it will finally impose penalties against traffickers. ##&& Bangladesh has acceded to a number of international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, including UNTOC, and participates in several international forums for law-enforcement training, alongside regional wildlife protection schemes. Furthermore, it has extradition agreements in place across the world. However, there is little evidence suggesting compliance with international human-rights standards, or the appetite to do so. ","text - criminal justice and security":"Many of the laws that underpin the criminal justice system are antiquated, and the poor and vulnerable struggle to access justice. The prison system is overcrowded, suffers from delays in judicial proceedings and poor infrastructure, and falls well short of international prison standards. Despite widespread human trafficking in Bangladesh, the conviction rate for such crimes stands is extremely low. In 2020 Bangladesh established seven specialized anti-trafficking courts in order to process human-trafficking cases more efficiently and clear the backlog. Corruption is widespread, especially in lower courts, with court officials frequently demanding bribes or making rulings based on loyalty to patronage networks. Moreover, delays in the recruitment of judges have created a significant backlog in cases, and there is political interference and weak institutional capacity. ##&& Corruption is also rampant among law-enforcement officials, often acting in accordance with political or criminal patronage. The military, its intelligence agency and police units have committed many human-rights abuses, such as carrying out extrajudicial killings, torture and unlawful detentions. However, Bangladesh commits considerable resources to participating in international forums and training aimed at equipping law-enforcement officers with measures to combat human smuggling and other crimes. Bangladesh also created programmes that have resulted in many more women joining law-enforcement teams, creating a more representative police force. While Bangladesh\u2019s borders are very difficult to monitor and police, increasing the country\u2019s vulnerability to many criminal markets such as human trafficking and migrant smuggling, its territorial integrity is good and criminal actors do not have sufficient strength or control enough territory to challenge the Bangladeshi military or its existence as a unified state. ","text - economic and financial environment":"Bangladesh is vulnerable to money-laundering practices, with alternative remittance and value-transfer systems commonly used to avoid taxes and customs duties. Reports also indicate the rising popularity of money exchange on the black market due to the limitations of Bangladesh\u2019s economy and currency. While the number of cases filed under the government\u2019s anti-money-laundering legislation remains very low, Bangladesh has recently given much more attention to the issue, and has developed a national strategy that has gained approval from international organizations set up to monitor money laundering. ##&& The Bangladeshi economy continues to be among the fastest-growing in the world; however, due to insufficient investment and lack of regulatory predictability, the private sector remains weak. As corruption levels are so high in the Bangladeshi land administration, and confidence in property rights so low, many businesses expect to pay bribes to acquire construction permits and other extrajudicial means, often mediated by mastans. State ownership and interference in the financial sector is very high. ","text - civil society and social protection":"Victims of crime in Bangladesh receive support primarily through non-governmental organizations (NGOs), mainly those helping victims of human trafficking; nevertheless, many NGOs offering victim and witness support do receive funding from the Bangladeshi government. Although small legislative steps have been taken to protect individual identities, witness protection is virtually non-existent in Bangladesh and is highly ineffective against organized crime. Prevention programmes designed to reduce participation in organized crime are severely lacking in Bangladesh, especially those focused on the recruitment of children by criminal groups. Prevention efforts are mainly informal, carried out by the community or police force rather than though any institutionalized effort. ##&& Although NGO-led community-based education and health-awareness systems have had positive impacts on poverty eradication, literacy and public health outcomes, many civil-society organizations appear to have entered powerful patronage networks. Moreover, the restriction of free speech and criticism of the government renders it difficult for civil society organizations and NGOs to voice democratic values and human rights concerns. Journalists are also targets of violence and arbitrary arrests, and certain news websites have been blocked. Many civil society organizations and media outlets have thus adopted increasing levels of self-censorship to avoid the consequences of speaking out against widespread human rights violations and the abuse of democratic values.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Dhaka","GDP (current $US million)":"302571.25","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"163046161","Land Area (sq. km)":"147570","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"85","Freedom in the World Index":"39","Human Development Index":"0.63","Global Peace Index":"2.12","Democracy Index":"5.99","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"26","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1856","1":"4.98","1.1":"4.95","1.2":"5.00","2":"4.13"},{"Corresp":"20","ISO-3":"BTN","Country":"Bhutan","ISO-2":"BT","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Southern Asia","Flag file":"bt.png","1.

Because the law allows children under the age of 14 to work, both Bhutanese and foreign children, usually from Nepal and India, are vulnerable to the practices of forced labour, sexual exploitation and domestic servitude. Bhutanese girls are allegedly trafficked by relatives to urban areas and placed into domestic servitude or forced to work as entertainers in drayangs \u2013 bars where young girls and women dance, sing and entertain customers, usually men. This occurs in relation to payment of debts, rather than as part of organized crime. Indian women and girls are also pushed into domestic servitude and prostitution, while Indian men frequently are victims of forced labour. Reports indicate that Bhutanese nationals are exploited abroad, but less frequently. ##&& Bhutan\u2019s human smuggling market is believed to run parallel to its human trafficking market and to exist primarily along its porous border with India. Possibly, human smuggling exists in another direction as well, with Chinese or Tibetan citizens moving into Bhutan or vice versa. Overall, no evidence points towards a significant human smuggling market in Bhutan.","text - trade":"Despite the large illicit arms market in north-eastern India and the potential availability of smuggling routes into Bhutan, no evidence points towards major arms-related criminal activities or the existence of a significant arms trafficking market in the country.","text - environment":"Local ethnic groups allegedly collude with Indian organized crime groups and corrupt Bhutanese officials in illegally logging and smuggling timber over Bhutan\u2019s porous southern and northern borders. The primary destination for illicit timber seems to be north-eastern India. The illicit logging industry is particularly rampant in Gelephu, Samtse and Paro, as well as the Manas National Park, where understaffing hinders law enforcement efforts. Additionally, given the extensive harvesting of caterpillar fungus taking place in India and the high prices of this commodity in China, Bhutan primarily serves as a transit zone for smuggling between the two countries. The illicit caterpillar fungus market has developed into a significant and highly lucrative economy, and the illegal market in Bhutan remains in existence even after the country legalized harvesting during specific times of the year. ##&& The market for illegal fauna-related products is also pervasive throughout the country, with the result that tiger poaching in the country has become particularly concerning. Around a fifth of the tiger population in Bhutan was poached in the course of only four years, as well as in India. Tiger parts are then smuggled from or through Bhutan into China. Other species are also traded in and through Bhutan, such as leopards, bears and deer. Bhutanese gold smugglers have also exploited the porous Bhutan\u2013India border to move gold between Tibet and India or Nepal. Reports indicate that smuggling occurs via air routes between Bangkok in Thailand and Paro in western Bhutan, as well as by land routes. ","text - drugs":"No evidence points towards the existence of a significant heroin trade in Bhutan, aside from seemingly isolated incidents of adulterated heroin being smoked in some parts of the country. There is potentially a market for heroin in urban regions of Bhutan and possibly opium in rural areas. These products would most likely enter from Myanmar, which is one of the world\u2019s largest heroin producers, through India. No evidence suggests that a cocaine market exists in Bhutan. ##&& Bhutan is primarily a transit country in the regional cannabis trade. Nevertheless, wild cannabis grows freely in Bhutan and is consumed and traded within the country along with processed cannabis (hashish). These products are likely not exported abroad. Although the domestic market is relatively small, data shows a very high rate of adolescent cannabis users. Large consignments of codeine-based cough syrups transiting through the Bhutan\u2013India border have been seized across South-eastern Asia, but Bhutan\u2019s synthetic drug trade remains quite limited. Reports indicate increased use and movement of synthetic drugs in urban areas of Bhutan, due to South-eastern Asia\u2019s oversupply of high-purity and low-cost synthetic drugs.","text - criminal actors":"While evidence of significant involvement of foreign actors in organized criminal activities in Bhutan remains limited, the frequent exchange of goods across Bhutan\u2019s southern borderlands raises the likelihood of that. While traditional mafia-style groups do not exist in Bhutan as such, elite sectors of Bhutanese nobility and the aristocracy operate with mafioso-like powers and protection. Loose criminal networks are also present in Bhutan and are involved across a spectrum of organized crime activities, including gold smuggling, flora- and fauna-related crimes, and drug and human trafficking. Most groups function domestically, but some operate across the Bhutan\u2013India border as well. Although evidence regarding state-embedded actors involved in organized crime remains limited, there have been reports of Bhutanese villagers living under a \u2018shadow of fear\u2019 due to power dynamics relating to government and other officials who wield power over village life.","text - leadership and governance":"Bhutan has failed to take a strong stance against organized crime, but overall organized crime levels are not very pronounced. There is no evidence to suggest organized crime has infiltrated the electoral system or any state services. Although corruption perception levels are fairly low, favouritism and nepotism are recognized as problematic. Thus, anti-corruption features more strongly on the government\u2019s agenda. Two separate agencies monitor state spending and a legislative framework guarantees the right to access public information. Although cronyism and oligarchy are certainly endemic in Bhutan, more decentralized and democratic governance transformations are creating more transparent and accountable state agencies and organizations. ##&& Bhutan\u2019s long-standing state policy of relative isolation appears to have hampered the development of more robust legal mechanisms and international agreements to combat transnational crime. Nevertheless, the country is becoming more engaged in international cooperation. Bhutan is a signatory party to a number of international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, with the notable exception of the UNTOC and its three protocols. As a member of the South Asian Regional Intelligence and Coordination Centre, Bhutan also cooperates with Bangladesh, the Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka and especially India to combat drug trafficking and other organized crime activity. Bhutan\u2019s legislative framework seems to adequately respond to current organized crime threats. The country is also implementing ongoing amendments to its laws, especially in relation to drugs, in order to enable a more efficient law enforcement response to drug trafficking. Human trafficking, however, is a key area where national policies seem underdeveloped, as the legal definition of trafficking victims is inconsistent with international law and excludes specific aspects of victimization.","text - criminal justice and security":"Bhutan does not allocate special courts to handle organized crime-related offences, and while no evidence suggests organized crime has infiltrated the judicial system, corruption is reportedly an issue. Inconsistent court-case management and delays in the resolution of cases are also problematic practices. Prisons and detention centres in the country reportedly meet international standards. There is also no evidence to suggest widespread corruption among Bhutanese law enforcement officials. While Bhutan\u2019s territorial integrity is relatively stable, being landlocked between India and China and with no standing army, the country is somewhat vulnerable. An issue of concern is the Bhutan\u2013India border, which allows for relatively free movement of illicit goods through Bhutan.","text - economic and financial environment":"Issues of money laundering in Bhutan are largely attributable to underdeveloped state and governance mechanisms and the relative inexperience of central authorities in combating such crimes. Although Bhutan passed legislation on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism and is a member of international initiatives pertaining to these practices, certain vulnerabilities persist that sustain the increased risk of money laundering. Bhutan\u2019s private sector remains underdeveloped and competition is particularly limited. As a result, doing business in the country is difficult. Additionally, the small size of Bhutan and its historical monarchical structure have established a business environment that is especially difficult for foreign investors to break into. It is therefore unlikely for criminal groups to have penetrated the legal economy of the country on a significant scale. Recent governmental efforts to open the economy up to foreign investors in spheres outside of tourism, however, might contribute to this changing.","text - civil society and social protection":"Although there are notable efforts on the part of the authorities to improve victim and witness support, it remains poor. The government, along with NGOs, has developed guidelines for best practices with regard to the identification and referral of trafficking victims. Investigations into labour exploitation, including that taking place abroad, have been launched, and more women and child protection units have been established in police stations. Conflicting with these efforts are the widespread denial and cover-up of human rights abuses with respect to ethnically Nepali Bhutanese citizens who have become refugees. Minimal effort has been made to address victims of Bhutan\u2019s drug epidemic. In terms of prevention, the country lacks a national action plan to prevent human trafficking, although some efforts have been made in that direction. The country is a member of international drug trafficking prevention initiatives and it benefits from support of its community awareness programmes regarding rampant drug use and human trafficking risks. ##&& NGOs reportedly collaborate with government agencies to provide awareness raising regarding human trafficking to vulnerable groups. Despite the relationship between NGOs and authorities, civil society is reportedly underdeveloped, especially in rural areas. Additionally, strict control is enforced while capacities are limited. The media environment is no different and is regulated by authorities in line with the 2018 Information, Communications and Media Act.

","text - civil society and social protection":"Although Brunei\u2019s police encourage victims to assist in investigations as witnesses and promise them protection, there is no known witness-protection programme in the country. In general, Brunei lacks the necessary mechanisms to support victims and witnesses of crime. There is no formal system of identifying victims of human trafficking, but Brunei has rehabilitation and protection centres that take in trafficked victims. ##&& While Brunei has built up and implemented its regulations on crime reduction and prevention, there is no readily available information on a national prevention strategy for transnational organized crime. According to the government, however, actions associated with its national development plan have had crime-prevention outcomes. ##&& Brunei partakes in the ASEAN 2016-2025 Plan of Action to Combat Transnational Crime. Given the country\u2019s heavily monarchical political culture, in which the sultan exercises executive power, civil-society organizations (CSOs) are scarce and operate under a strong regime of state supervision. Recently, ASEAN CSOs have issued a joint statement on the implementation of Sharia laws in Brunei, which they fear will significantly curtail their space for civic participation. Journalists in Brunei do not enjoy the freedom to cover any issue without fear of reprisal and generally operate in a restricted environment.

The country is a destination market for victims from Vietnam, and a transit point for victims trafficked to Thailand. Women and girls are the primary victim group, trafficked for prostitution, while men are sent into forced labour. Cambodia is a key destination for the sexual exploitation of children, especially in the tourism industry. As poverty is rife, most victims of trafficking are lured by false job opportunities and tied into debt bondage. Trafficking operations are run mainly by Cambodian nationals with the help of corrupt officials. ##&& Cambodia is predominantly a source country of migrant smuggling throughout the region, most commonly into Thailand, where wages are higher and the cost of smuggling is much cheaper than using legal channels. Cambodia\u2019s weak economy and lack of regular work increases the demand for smuggling services, which are facilitated by weak border control mechanisms. Smuggling is run by loose and decentralized criminal groups, and facilitated by corrupt law enforcement, immigration and government officials. Smuggling groups have been successful in evolving their practices to avoid the legal frameworks that have been put in place to prevent irregular migration. ","text - trade":"Historically a significant source country for weapons, Cambodia has evolved into a transit country for arms smuggling, primarily into Myanmar. Though international intervention has diminished the national stockpile of weapons, a significant number of arms are still being recovered within the country, with government corruption putting state-held weapons at risk of being trafficked. A small domestic market also exists, with social media being used to advertise and sell illicit arms to citizens.","text - environment":"Cambodia\u2019s forests are home to precious resources and medicinal plants that create a large market for flora crimes, especially in the form of illegal logging and timber. Up to 70% of Cambodia\u2019s timber products comprise rare and illegal species. The illegal flora trade is conducted in parallel with legal business, with the mixing of illicit and licit wood during its transportation being the most common method of concealing illegally procured timber. The illicit flora market provides lucrative income for low-paid foresters and farmers, and has a particularly close involvement with the ruling elite. The impact has been severe on Cambodian forests, which have declined significantly in the last two decades. ##&& Cambodia has a large illegal wildlife market and is a source country for many rare species. Combined with increasing consumer demand and weak law enforcement, this has created a diversified and well-consolidated market. Transnational organized crime groups are involved in fauna crimes throughout the region and benefit from Cambodia\u2019s porous borders. The market is driven primarily by local demand for wild meat and wildlife ingredients used in traditional medicines. Cambodia\u2019s fisheries were blacklisted by the EU in 2014 for illegal and unregulated fishing, and many illegal trawlers are protected by powerful criminals with political connections. Cambodia\u2019s criminal market for non-renewable resources consists mainly of sand mining and the extraction of minerals such as gold. According to the UN, Cambodia has been significantly under-reporting the amount of sand it exports to Singapore, in particular. The facilitators and beneficiaries of non-renewable crimes are thought to be members of the ruling elite. ","text - drugs":"Cambodia\u2019s synthetic drug market is well consolidated and continuously expanding due to the country\u2019s proximity to the Golden Triangle, its porous borders and corrupt and underdeveloped law enforcement structures. Cambodia is an important transit country for synthetic drugs, which are smuggled through its north-eastern borders and then trafficked into the wider region and beyond. Due to the falling prices of methamphetamine and ecstasy, the number of synthetic drug users is increasing, and larger seizures are made by Cambodia's law enforcement agencies every year. As with most forms of organized crime in the country, corrupt officials facilitate the criminal market in Cambodia. Cannabis is widely used and culturally accepted in Cambodia, and its cultivation is widespread in rural areas, which supply the domestic and regional market. Among the arrests made in 2019, the majority of traffickers were foreign nationals. ##&& Cambodia is both a destination and transit country for heroin trafficking, with the cities of Siem Reap and Phnom Penh acting as the largest transit points into neighbouring countries. However, Cambodia is not a significant player in the illicit heroin trade compared with its neighbours in the region, and the trade is run mainly by international criminal groups. Only a small number of seizures have been made, and most of the demand for heroin seems to have migrated to the synthetic drug market. ##&& Cambodia serves as a transit country for cocaine trafficking. While seizures are usually small, they increased in 2020. Nevertheless, the value of the market in Cambodia remains much lower than in neighbouring countries.","text - criminal actors":"Despite a few small gangs with hierarchical structures, there do not appear to be any significant mafia-style groups operating within Cambodia. While small, loose criminal networks exist in the country, they are not prominent and operate mainly in the human trafficking and smuggling markets. Most markets are run by international criminal groups, with varying levels of involvement from the Cambodian government and law enforcement. Organized crime is run mostly by international groups colluding with local Cambodian criminals. ##&& The majority of Cambodia\u2019s criminal markets are also run by foreign criminal groups, with Chinese groups dominating human and drug trafficking. Taiwanese groups are also involved in drug markets, as are groups from Myanmar. Many Chinese organized crime groups use Phnom Penh as a safe haven and invest heavily in legitimate businesses in the country. These international groups are usually connected with and protected by the ruling elite in Cambodia. ##&& State-embedded actors are most heavily involved in the illegal logging industry, with Prime Minister Hun Sen and his supporters reportedly running the country\u2019s most powerful logging syndicate. The ruling elite is also accused of allocating rights to oil and mineral resources without due process. Political figures at the highest levels of government, as well as law enforcement officials, appear to provide protection to criminal markets as a means to enrich themselves, with the prime minister and his allies reportedly stashing millions abroad.","text - leadership and governance":"While the Cambodian political system has not been captured by organized crime, corruption is rampant and widespread, with little accountability or transparency, allowing many figures in the ruling elite to acquire wealth from criminal markets. Public trust in government institutions is low, while calls for more accountability in the public sector have not been met with commitments from government. Cambodia has enhanced its cooperation with its international partners by joining regional initiatives to combat drug and arms trafficking and signing UN conventions against its most prolific criminal markets. However, Cambodia diverges from the UN Model Treaty on Extradition and its penal code remains silent on a number of human rights issues. In spite of being a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations, which was established to promote intergovernmental and cross-border cooperation, Cambodia remains hostile towards Thai and Vietnamese policing agencies, and border liaison still appears to grant protection to favoured organized crime groups. ##&& While Cambodia has legislation in place to combat most forms of organized crime, sufficient enforcement is lacking. Legislative processes are slow, as can be seen with the Arms Trade Treaty being implemented years after it was signed and the fact that arms brokers and intermediaries remain unregulated. In the flora and fauna criminal markets, the penalties are considered insufficient to act as deterrents and national laws do not adequately implement the regulations set up by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Corrupt practices in government and law enforcement also act to undermine any national legislation aimed at preventing organized crime.","text - criminal justice and security":"While Cambodia\u2019s Constitution guarantees an independent judiciary, the rule of law in Cambodia is extremely fragile. The criminal investigation system is ineffective and corrupt and enforcement is rudimentary, with more emphasis placed on petty crime than on high-level organized crime. Political intervention also occurs in the judicial system, with the ruling party approving appointments to judicial offices. The prison system is underfunded, and overcrowding has ballooned since the government launched an anti-drug initiative in 2017. In May 2020, the government announced plans to reform the criminal justice system to reduce the backlog in cases and prison overcrowding, which is largely due to the number of detainees being held in pre-trial detention facilities. ##&& Enhancing border security is a top priority for the government. Since 2018, Cambodia\u2019s armed forces have attempted to crack down on smuggling and trafficking across its borders. However, despite these increased efforts, border control forces are poorly resourced and have insufficient specialized knowledge and a limited budget. Cambodia therefore has porous borders that are vulnerable to the trafficking of several illicit commodities. Its border with Thailand is particularly vulnerable to human trafficking and smuggling. Each year, thousands of Cambodians illegally cross the border into Thailand, where they use false documentation and permits to secure work. Corruption is present at the border, with some Chinese groups appearing to have privileged access in and out of the country. ##&& There is no clear distinction of roles for Cambodia's law enforcement agencies, and in many rural areas the Cambodian national police are severely under-resourced and dependent on user-pay models. Patron-client networks are rife at the highest levels of law enforcement, and recruitment processes are also open to patronage, which has led to a widespread lack of trust in the police and a low reporting rate of criminal victimization.","text - economic and financial environment":"Cambodia is a member of the Asia\/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and is currently subject to increased monitoring as a result of numerous strategic deficiencies in its anti-money laundering framework. Improvements have been made in complying with international standards regarding the criminalizing of money laundering, as well as to due diligence processes and the reporting of suspicious transactions. However, the use of financial intelligence in investigating money laundering and terrorist financing is poor, and despite appearing responsive to international cooperation, Cambodia\u2019s implementation of international agreements has been lacking. ##&& Cambodia is one of the countries in South-eastern Asia most open to foreign investment, allowing foreign investment and ownership in most industries. It has also implemented notable reforms to make the trade regime more open and transparent. However, due to corruption, the perpetration of property offences and an inefficient bureaucracy, Cambodia remains a very difficult place to do business.","text - civil society and social protection":"While domestic law legislates for the protection of witnesses and whistle-blowers, the measures are insufficient and ineffective in practice. Whistle-blowers face significant risks, and defamation provisions in Cambodia\u2019s penal code limit the number of willing witnesses. The government\u2019s response to human trafficking victims falls well short of international standards. In regard to organized crime prevention measures, community policing initiatives have been encouraged by Cambodia\u2019s international partners, but implementation has been minimal and the government has no strategy for a community response to organized crime. While there are sporadic community-style policing efforts in some of the rural areas, these are undermined by poorly resourced and corrupt local policing services. ##&& In 2018 the Cambodian government took measures to shrink even further the country\u2019s already-small civic space. Civil society organizations face ongoing intimidation and threats by the government, whose cooperation with them is very limited, but some progress has been made in recent years with regard to protecting the victims of child exploitation. ##&& Cambodia\u2019s media is heavily censored. The media environment is hostile, with 30 radio stations and the Cambodian Daily newspaper being closed without explanation by the government before the last election; Cambodians now only have access to news from media outlets that are linked to Prime Minister Hun Sen. Critical journalists are regularly imprisoned, and labour unions are kept under surveillance as well as subjected to intimidation and violence.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Phnom Penh","GDP (current $US million)":"27089.39","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"16486542","Land Area (sq. km)":"181040","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"80.6","Freedom in the World Index":"24","Human Development Index":"0.59","Global Peace Index":"2.01","Democracy Index":"3.10","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"21","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1643","1":"5.83","1.1":"6.15","1.2":"5.50","2":"3.92"},{"Corresp":"36","ISO-3":"CHN","Country":"China","ISO-2":"CN","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Eastern Asia","Flag file":"cn.png","1.

Women and girls, primarily, are trafficked into forced marriage, and children are trafficked into illicit adoptions. Trafficking victims have been forced to engage in street performance, begging and theft. Organ trafficking has emerged as a lucrative source of revenue for crime groups. Crime syndicates, local gangs and independent traffickers traffic Chinese women and girls internally for sexual exploitation. Chinese traffickers subject women and children from neighbouring countries, Africa and the Americas into forced labour and sexual exploitation. Foreign trafficking victims are moved through China to elsewhere in Asia. Overall, given China\u2019s enormous population size, the country is home to among the largest number of victims of modern slavery worldwide, a notable example being the exploitation of Uyghur Muslims in state-sponsored forced labour camps in the Xinjiang region. While Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities are paid, they are nonetheless compelled to take on jobs, both in and outside Xinjiang, that they would not otherwise engage in. ##&& China\u2019s human smuggling market also poses a significant issue. Chinese migrants are smuggled to South-eastern Asia, and onwards to North America and Europe. Migrants from neighbouring countries, as well as from South-eastern Asia, are smuggled into China. The Fujian and Zhejiang provinces are major human smuggling hubs, although many other areas are now emerging as human smuggling hotspots, and Hong Kong and Macau serve as primary destination and transit points. Most smuggled individuals in China are seeking better economic opportunities abroad, including individuals who do not live in poverty. Migrants pay considerably more to be transported abroad, rendering the market a lucrative source of revenue for smugglers. The majority of smuggled migrants are adult men seeking transport to the UK or the US. Smuggled individuals are vulnerable to exploitation along the journey and are often promised fraudulent opportunities or are exploited once abroad.","text - trade":"Although the arms trafficking market in China is extremely limited, insofar as it exists, China is a source and destination country. Illicit arms manufacturing and sales occur domestically and arms are trafficked into China from other countries. However, the arms trafficking market is not associated with high levels of violence and is arguably quite small, given the country\u2019s strict gun laws. Most cases of arms trafficking involve individuals and crime gangs that operate domestically or Chinese nationals based abroad. The issue of deactivated guns being packaged and exported has arisen recently, but overall, the arms trafficking market is limited.","text - environment":"China has one of the world\u2019s largest wildlife trafficking markets. Wildlife is trafficked into China from various destinations, such as Africa, South-eastern Asia and Southern Asia. Wildlife parts and products are traded for consumption and medicinal purposes. Poachers primarily target species such as pangolins, bears, tigers, sea horses and sharks. Ivory, rhino horns, big-cat skins, claws and canines are trafficked into China for decorative purposes. Although ivory trafficking has declined significantly since the government implemented a domestic trade ban on ivory in 2017, ivory continues to be smuggled into China from South-eastern Asia, especially by tourists. Other illicit goods, such as rhino horns, are trafficked into China from African countries and sold in retail outlets or through online trading platforms. Live animals, including a number of species of birds, reptiles and mammals, are traded in exotic-pet markets. Transnational crime groups, foreign criminals and independent traffickers all engage in the wildlife-trafficking market and Chinese government officials have been implicated. Although the market is not associated with high levels of violence, it has had an extremely negative effect on biodiversity and the ecological balance. ##&& China\u2019s illicit logging and timber trafficking markets are also among the largest worldwide. Timber is smuggled into China from South-eastern Asia, Africa and Latin America, and often sourced by Chinese logging companies abroad. China plays an especially large role in the global illicit rosewood trade, accounting for the majority of global demand. Chinese crime networks abroad have bribed government officials and committed fraud and tax evasion to source and traffic illicit timber into China. The Chinese traditional medicine market generates a high demand for illicitly harvested plants, such as wild American ginseng, which are trafficked into China from the US. Criminals engage in illicit orchid harvesting in China and abroad. Although non-renewable-resource crimes are less pervasive, crime groups and independent criminals engage in the illicit extraction, theft and smuggling of minerals. Some reports suggest that minerals are trafficked into China from Africa and that gold is trafficked into China from the Philippines.","text - drugs":"China\u2019s methamphetamine market is among the world\u2019s largest, and users account for at least half of the total number of people who use drugs in the country. In recent years, methamphetamine surpassed heroin as the country\u2019s most consumed drug. Crystalline methamphetamine seizures, in particular, are on the rise, especially in Yunnan Province. Ketamine abuse is common. China has traditionally been a crucial supplier of synthetic drugs to multiple foreign markets, although many clandestine methamphetamine labs have been dismantled in recent years and the country\u2019s role in the global synthetic drug trade has diminished. However, producers in China remain a primary source of fentanyl for the US. A wide range of actors, including independent traffickers and transnational organized crime groups, are involved in China\u2019s synthetic drug trade. ##&& Heroin is among the most abused substances in the country and the heroin trade is among the largest globally, generating billions of dollars annually. Most heroin is trafficked into China from the Golden Triangle and, to a lesser extent, the Golden Crescent. Most heroin trafficked out of Myanmar in particular is destined for China. The heroin trade constitutes a major source of revenue for domestic and foreign organized criminals. Nigerian criminal groups operate in Guangzhou, and foreign engagement in the drug trade is fairly unique in the Chinese context as most criminal markets do not feature foreign organized criminal groups. ##&& Cannabis cultivation is legal for industrial use in China, although marijuana is strictly forbidden. Rising local demand for marijuana has led to an increase in cannabis trafficking between North America and China. Cannabis is trafficked into China from abroad through international delivery services and often by foreign students or Chinese citizens who have studied or worked abroad. Criminals cultivate cannabis domestically. Cannabis addiction is on the rise in China, especially among foreigners, Chinese citizens who have lived abroad and figures in the entertainment industry. Overall, however, cannabis demand is still far lower than the demand for other drugs such as heroin, and its popularity is specific to only certain segments of the wider population in China. ##&& Cocaine consumption is less pervasive, although China is becoming an increasingly important transit node for cocaine trafficking between South America and Oceania. Furthermore, there is a sizeable cocaine trade between China and Mexico, as Chinese organized criminal groups export precursor chemicals for methamphetamine to Mexico and, in return, Mexican drug cartels export cocaine to China.","text - criminal actors":"Although thousands of mafia-style groups operate across China, no large or prominent, well-known groups operate in mainland China. However, several Triad groups with defined leadership operate in Hong Kong, including notorious groups such as the 14K, Sun Yee On and Wo Shing Wo Triads. Although membership numbers are low in mafia-style groups that operate in mainland China, membership of Triad groups in Hong Kong is much higher. Hundreds of thousands of Triad members have been identified in recent years. Mafia-style groups engage in all of China\u2019s criminal markets but are especially active in drug trafficking markets. Although most mafia-style groups focus on one crime market, the Triad groups in Hong Kong engage in multiple markets. Extortion is common among mafia-style groups. Nevertheless, they exert low control over territory in China. China\u2019s mafia-style groups have limited access to weapons, such as knives and guns, and their members do not usually carry arms openly. Lethal violence is limited, although threats and soft violence occur. ##&& Although the Chinese government is rarely directly involved in carrying out illicit activity, the protective umbrella provided to mafia-style groups in mainland China (a benefit not extended to the Triads in Hong Kong) by the authorities is crucial in allowing these groups the freedom to operate with impunity. It is important to note that there has been a certain symbiosis between the interests of local authorities and those of the mafia groups for many years, with the latter being used by the former to gather information and disrupt demonstrations, most recently pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, for example. Furthermore, local politicians and police officers often turn a blind eye to various criminal markets. Corruption is key to understanding state-embedded actors in China. While most cases are relatively small-scale and involve individual actors, there are other cases where the web of corruption is extensive and extends to the upper echelons of the regional state apparatus. ##&& Transnational criminal networks operate in some regions of China in a range of crimes, from human trafficking to human smuggling, wildlife and drug trafficking. Chinese-led crime networks that participated in ivory trafficking before the 2017 ivory trade ban have shifted towards pangolin trafficking. Foreign nationals and locals cooperate in many of China\u2019s crime markets, especially in transnational markets, such as the human, wildlife and drug trafficking markets, as well as in establishing major transnational money laundering networks. Foreign actors involved in the drug trade are especially active in south-west China. However, no foreign actors exert significant control over Chinese crime markets.","text - leadership and governance":"The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) exerts strong political leadership and has exhibited determination to fight organized crime at the central government level, but at local levels political leadership is weak. Furthermore, the Chinese government exhibits strong authoritarianism and has committed numerous human rights abuses, in particular in the context of the persecution of Uyghur Muslims. Anti-organized crime legislation and regulation have been followed by effective law enforcement efforts. The government launched an ongoing three-year campaign against drug trafficking, prostitution and fraud in 2018, targeting both organized criminals and corrupt state-embedded actors. ##&& However, the massive anti-corruption drive launched by President Xi is precisely because of the extremely high levels of corruption at lower levels of government. Furthermore, the anti-corruption campaign also serves a dual purpose, as policy decisions taken by the government purportedly in the interest of tackling criminality are first and foremost made in the pursuit of political goals. Indeed, anti-corruption measures are often used to target dissidents, political opponents or businesspeople who are critical of the government. The National Supervisory Commission was created in 2018 and given the task of handling anti-corruption efforts. It also investigates government employees. Corruption still remains a concern, however, and there are no non-state or international oversight mechanisms in place to monitor Chinese governance. Although the government\u2019s budget, revenue, expenditure and procurement contracts are published on a regular basis, access to information in China is poor. ##&& China has ratified all relevant international conventions and treaties related to organized crime, with the exception of the Arms Trade Treaty. The country participates in and actively promotes international collaboration efforts against organized crime with countries in the region, namely South-eastern Asian states, but cooperation on matters pertaining to organized crime with Western countries is very limited. However, amid the controversy surrounding the Hong Kong National Security Law, many countries, including the UK, the US and Germany, suspended extradition treaties with China. Domestically, however, the government has implemented legislation related to all crime markets and Chinese laws are among the strictest worldwide. They are, however, often implemented with political objectives in mind in the interests of the Chinese government. While the COVID-19 pandemic brought about notable changes to illegal wildlife policy in China in the short term, only time will tell whether the global health crisis whose origin is thought to have links to the illegal wildlife trade (IWT) will have a lasting impact on the IWT.","text - criminal justice and security":"The Chinese judiciary is adequately resourced and has proved effective in prosecuting organized crime, but the fairness of trials is regularly questioned. Furthermore, the judiciary lacks a specific unit dedicated to organized crime. Control over the prison system, as well as legislation pertaining to the country\u2019s penitentiaries, is adequate, although no external investigations have confirmed the status of prison conditions in relation to international standards due to restricted access to foreign observers. In addition to allegations around corrupt prison personnel, several allegations have been made regarding forced organ harvesting within prisons, and the unlawful detention of Uyghurs in camps, where victims are forced into labour and women are sterilized, has led to numerous countries accusing China of committing systematic human rights violations. ##&& Law enforcement is adequately funded and highly effective against organized crime at the national level, but human rights abuses are regularly observed. An anti-organized crime unit exists and citizens are encouraged to share information about organized crime. A nationwide campaign against organized crime was launched in November 2019 and resulted in the capture of thousands of fugitives. Chinese law enforcement shares intelligence regarding organized crime with foreign governments. However, corruption within local police forces is pervasive, and police officers often turn a blind eye to a whole host of illicit economies operating throughout the country. At a local policing level, wages are low, which increases the incentives of officers to collaborate with organized criminal actors. ##&& China\u2019s border infrastructure is adequate in terms of protecting the country against organized crime. Nevertheless, its borders are long and difficult to monitor, and cross-border smuggling and trafficking continue to occur. The Yunnan and Guangxi provinces are particularly vulnerable to drug trafficking, although authorities in these regions regularly check vehicles crossing the borders. Mountainous terrain and bodies of water along China\u2019s borders with Vietnam pose a challenge to border security, and numerous paths and trails along other portions of the country\u2019s borders increase pressure on border-control officials. Overall, China\u2019s law enforcement and border control capacities remain strong and customs officials take measures to control goods at airports and ports. However, as container shipping increased as a reliable alternative to land and air routes amid the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns and other restrictive measures affected border forces\u2019 ability to implement controls, which allowed for more trafficking to go undetected.","text - economic and financial environment":"The government has increased its efforts to combat money laundering and financial terrorism. Banks are required to track capital sources and verify the background of shareholders and executives. These measures have been well enforced and fines have been administered for non-compliance. Nevertheless, China remains a major money laundering in relation to organized crime, both on the mainland and in Hong Kong. The opacity of the system undermines efforts to counter money laundering and a lack of cooperation and fragmented access to data in China\u2019s financial intelligence unit exacerbates the issue. Large scale underground banking networks also exist and, so far, the government does not have the capacity to tackle them. ##&& However, legitimate businesses are generally protected from the influence of organized crime and are able to expand under fair-market competition. Organized crime groups do not dominate any specific sector of the economy, although some crime groups are known to provide financial services.  Chinese law upholds land and property rights effectively. However, in practice, land rights are often breached by local authorities, for example by demolishing private property for the purpose of development or land speculation. Although industries and the private sector are not typically involved in reducing organized crime threats, some enterprises have been involved.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim protection and assistance is limited in China and existing services are administered arbitrarily. However, the government has shifted in recent years towards treating drug users as victims as much as they are treated as criminals. Furthermore, heroin use is no longer a primary driver of HIV infections in China, due to heavy state investment in antiretrovirals, methadone maintenance, and other forms of healthcare and harm reduction approaches. Witness protection measures are in place. The country cooperates with others to prevent organized crimes, such as human trafficking. Local communities and community policing initiatives have engaged in awareness-raising activities and other campaigns to combat various forms of crime, such as the so-called \u2018sweep away black\u2019 campaign. China\u2019s national office against organized crime has created a reporting website enabling citizens to share information and provide leads on organized crime activity. Many awareness programmes regarding the illicit wildlife trade are in place. ##&& While there a tens of thousands of civil society groups registered with the state, including several that participate in drug treatment programmes or work to combat illicit wildlife trade, state controls on civil society, and in particular on civil society organizations\u2019 ability to operate freely, are deepening. Foreign non-governmental organizations are subject to close government scrutiny, as well as stringent registration and reporting requirements. China has one of the worst environments for media freedom worldwide and the government exerts high levels of control of the media in the country. Online censorship and surveillance are widespread, although is for the most part conducted by private companies at the behest of the authorities, rather than by the state or law enforcement themselves. Many social media websites are banned and citizens could face fines, detention or prison for non-compliance with media and information laws.

Domestically, Georgian women and women from Azerbaijan and Central Asia are forced into prostitution in large cities in the country, such as Batumi and Tbilisi, as well as in the tourist destinations of the Adjara region. Women from former Soviet republics are trafficked through Georgia on their way to Turkey. Forced labour is also a common practice, with both Georgian men and women trafficked domestically and abroad. The primary trafficking destinations for forced labour are Turkey, the UAE, Egypt, Cyprus and Iraq. Street children as well as children working in agriculture and in the informal urban economy are particularly vulnerable to exploitation. Georgian, Romani and Kurdish children are coerced into begging and other criminal activities in the country. ##&& Reportedly, organized crime groups targeted the Georgian borders in late 2015, smuggling individuals coming from Asia and Africa into Turkey. Little information has been available since then, suggesting that the flow has largely decreased.","text - trade":"The tensions in the two breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have left Georgia vulnerable to arms trafficking. Before the 2008 Russo\u2013Georgian war, Russia reportedly illegally supplied the de facto states with weapons. Current, concrete information is lacking on whether illicit flows of arms to the two regions are still ongoing.","text - environment":"Both commercial entities and private citizens are involved in illegal logging in Georgia. Arguably, mostly private citizens are involved in illicit logging because more than two-thirds of households in rural areas are dependent on firewood for heating. Nevertheless, logging for commercial purposes is also problematic. Corruption in the natural-resources sector is average and most logging goes unrecorded due to the limited ability of institutions to manage sustainable resources. The increased rural dependence on natural resources has also led to unsustainable hunting of endangered wildlife. Poaching incidents are recorded, but there is no indication of organized crime involvement. On the other hand, overfishing in the Black Sea is considerable, with fishermen exceeding their legal quotas up to ten times. Additionally, Georgia is reported to be a transit country for caviar sourced in Azerbaijan and destined for the EU. Incidents of oil theft are documented, but there is no information to indicate the involvement of organized crime groups.","text - drugs":"Emerging as an additional supply route for the European and, to a lesser extent, Russian markets, Georgia functions as a transit country for opiates produced in the Golden Crescent that are trafficked into Ukraine or Moldova, likely by ferries crossing the Black Sea. Mostly Turkish groups organize and control the trafficking of heroin from source to destination countries, although reports suggest they cooperate with Georgian criminal networks. Allegedly, small heroin production laboratories have been set up in Georgia over the past few years. While a domestic heroin market does exist, it is most likely very small. Cocaine trafficking in Georgia takes place on a small scale and satisfies very low domestic demand. ##&& Georgia is not a major cannabis producing country. Local indoor and outdoor cultivation has been recorded, but takes place on a small scale and mostly for personal use. On the other hand, the country is a transit point for synthetic drugs. Judging by seized quantities, Georgia is not a major corridor for synthetic-drug smuggling operations. A domestic market exists, with MDMA and amphetamine being the most common drugs in the country after cannabis.","text - criminal actors":"Most criminal networks in Georgia consist of poorly organized young people trying to gain control over a specific territory in competition with other similar groups. They are involved in petty crime, mainly robbing cars and small shops. Reports of bank robberies by better-organized violent groups have also emerged. In addition, criminal networks are also likely involved in heroin trafficking, cooperating with foreign actors. As mostly Turkish groups control the trafficking of heroin, information suggests these have established their presence in the legal economy of key countries along the trafficking route. Thus it is possible that such groups control legal businesses in Georgia. Foreign actors may collaborate with individual facilitators in the country as well, or have Georgian nationals in their ranks. ##&& State-embedded actors were largely involved in smuggling activities and state-resource extraction in the 1990s. However, their prominence diminished in the first decade of the 21st century, following the implementation of comprehensive rule-of-law reforms. Although corruption is still an issue, especially in regions bordering South Ossetia and Abkhazia, there is no indication of the existence of pervasive corruption activities in the higher echelons of government and law enforcement. Similar to state-embedded actors, mafia-style groups known as kanonieri qurdebi or \u2018thieves-in-law\u2019 were very prominent in Georgia in the 1990s. The highly hierarchical group, with leaders of different clans equal in status, was largely dismantled in Georgia following the adoption of an anti-mafia strategy and the implementation of laws targeting the \u2018thieves-in-law\u2019. Currently, authorities believe mafia-style groups are no longer an issue in Georgia, but the elements that survived the governmental crackdown continue to operate abroad, in Russia and Western Europe. Additionally, information also suggests that criminal subculture may have again taken hold in certain prisons in the country.","text - leadership and governance":"Corruption perceptions in Georgia are low even by Western European standards, but issues exist. Oligarchs reportedly continue to hold influence over policy, political interests hinder rule of law, and tenders remain a challenge for policymakers. As mentioned above, the first decade of the 21st century saw significant anti-organized crime and anti-corruption reforms, which brought down criminality. More recently, cannabis was decriminalized and parliament considered, but did not pass, a draft law that would have allowed companies in the country to grow and export cannabis and regulated domestic consumption. While anti-corruption policies continue to be effectively enforced, nepotism persists. Local governments are often ineffective and weak, while the two breakaway regions in Georgia are sources of political fragility and vulnerability. Although the legal framework guiding public access to information is fairly coherent, there have been calls for a more robust law and greater transparency. Elections are generally fair. However, some electoral issues have been observed by the international community since 2016, which should prompt an adequate response. ##&& Georgia is party to all treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, with the exception of the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the UNTOC. International cooperation on matters of justice and law enforcement is well established in both law and practice. Most notably, the US Drug Enforcement Administration opened an office in Tbilisi, a testament to the ongoing support for Georgian law enforcement and the strong operational partnership that the country has developed with the US. The Georgian legislative framework covers all criminal markets under this Index. Recently, drug reforms have been on the policymakers\u2019 agenda.","text - criminal justice and security":"In spite of government assurances of reforms aiming to restore justice and ensure the independence of the judicial system, no meaningful and consistent changes have been implemented. A reluctance to discuss issues in the judiciary as well as closed-door decision-making without informal negotiations have put additional pressure on the judicial branch. The judiciary is also understaffed and capacity-building efforts are required, as evidenced by the backlog of cases. Despite decriminalizing cannabis and making efforts to regulate consumption, drug laws are aggressively enforced, which reportedly causes severe and unjustifiable harm. Claims of corruption in the detention system and the re-emergence of criminal subcultures in some prisons persist. There are specialized anti-organized crime units within the Georgian central criminal police department, mandated with countering human trafficking and drug-related offences. In addition, Georgia\u2019s state security service is tasked with fighting terrorism and organized crime. Major reforms have almost weeded out low-level corruption in law enforcement; however, as with the judicial system, law enforcement bodies lack independence from political interference. Reportedly, law enforcement agencies, including specialized units, are often understaffed and lack the ability and experience to effectively respond to organized crime threats. In spite of the training programmes and seminars that are implemented, other territorial challenges, such as the lack of control over the two breakaway regions, increase Georgia\u2019s vulnerability to trafficking and illicit flows.","text - economic and financial environment":"Georgia has made substantial progress in improving its anti-money laundering framework. The country has a financial intelligence unit, but limited resources and technical difficulties impede its work. Despite efforts to further strengthen its anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism framework and improve operational capabilities, the risk of money laundering in Georgia remains fair, with the country\u2019s gambling industry being most at risk. In contrast, governmental policies and the economic regulatory framework of the country are on paper supportive of and conducive to starting a business. Certain issues remain, the most serious of which are oligarchic interests preventing free competition, as well as a strong business lobby affecting major government decisions.","text - civil society and social protection":"Georgia meets the necessary minimal requirements for the elimination of human trafficking. Besides improving prosecution and law enforcement operational capabilities in relation to trafficking in persons, Georgia has enhanced victim support as well. The country financed victim assistance programmes as well as two victim shelters, staffed with medical, social and legal professionals. Furthermore, funds to NGOs for the reintegration of street children have been allocated. More mobile-identification groups were established to proactively identify victims of trafficking. In addition, over the past couple of years, more drug treatment and harm reduction programmes have been set up as well. The government continued to implement prevention efforts as well, although more inconsistently. A 2019\u20132020 national action plan was put into effect, but its implementation lacked transparency and no assessment of the results is available. Awareness raising has been a cornerstone of prevention efforts, with the government funding an NGO to raise awareness in 10 major cities, disseminating leaflets and organizing seminars. Nevertheless, some issues on victim support and human trafficking prevention remain, such as complicated procedures for obtaining official victim status and lack of resources, staff and proper training for an effective labour oversight. Conversely, drug use and drug trafficking prevention has not received as much attention on the part of the authorities. A national anti-drug action plan for 2021\u20132022 was drafted and one exists for 2019\u20132020, but reportedly no coherent prevention mechanisms are in place. Instead, efforts are for the most part either fragmented campaigns, limited to schools or media outlets, or NGO-spearheaded pilots, part of donor-funded projects. Evidently, the civil society sector has expanded over the past years, but is predominately concentrated in the capital. While some NGOs operate freely and are part of policy discussion, others report external pressures and defamation campaigns targeting them. The media landscape in Georgia is diverse, but reportedly polarized. Although transparency in media ownership improved, owners are often still in charge of produced content. Threats against journalists are not uncommon, but violence is becoming less frequent. Overall, the media environment in the country is well developed and free.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Tbilisi","GDP (current $US million)":"17477.26","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"3720161","Land Area (sq. km)":"69700","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"72.6","Freedom in the World Index":"60","Human Development Index":"0.81","Global Peace Index":"2.12","Democracy Index":"5.31","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"56","GDP per capita (current US$)":"4698","1":"2.97","1.1":"3.05","1.2":"2.88","2":"5.71"},{"Corresp":"77","ISO-3":"IND","Country":"India","ISO-2":"IN","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Southern Asia","Flag file":"in.png","1.

Trafficking in India primarily takes the form of young women and girls being trafficked to Gulf countries for the purposes of sexual exploitation, followed by men trafficked into Nepal, Bangladesh and many other destinations for forced labour. Children are also targets of trafficking, with Kolkata and Mumbai being major hubs for underage girls lured into sexual exploitation and forced marriages through false promises of employment. Human trafficking is expected to rise as a result of the mass unemployment crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic and traffickers are increasingly using social media, which makes it harder for authorities to track the practice. ##&& West Bengal and the Punjab regions have well-entrenched human-smuggling operations, largely meeting local demands for emigration. Recently, however, there have been changes in smuggling behaviour, with routes emerging to less popular countries, such as Denmark \u2013 most likely as a consequence of clampdowns on irregular movement by the more common destination countries. Ethnic and religious tensions in India suggest irregular migration may increase in the short term, with a large Indian diaspora to facilitate this irregular movement. ","text - trade":"India is a source, transit and destination country for illegal arms. Transnational arms smuggling primarily supplies international terror groups and national insurgencies with weapons smuggled through border states such as Kashmir and West Bengal. Demand for smuggled arms is especially driven by the presence of violent insurgent groups, particularly in Kashmir. They are supplied with illegal arms that come across the border from Pakistan. The porous borders, especially with Bangladesh, where smuggling methods are particularly sophisticated, as well as China and Myanmar, create ideal conditions to smuggle arms. India\u2019s states of Bihar and Madhya Pradesh serve as hotbeds of gun manufacturing. The flow, accessibility and affordability of illegal arms in India have served to normalize gun culture, and the number of crimes involving guns is increasing.","text - environment":"The domestic market for flora-related crimes is smaller compared to other environmental crime markets in the country, mostly consisting of illegal harvesting of and trade in medicinal plants or non-timber forest products. Locals in forest areas often harvest plants illegally to pay off debts to agents, who also function as moneylenders, perpetuating a cycle of debt and illegal plant collection. However, the COVID-19 lockdowns have changed the market dynamics quite a bit and resulted in a significant spike in illicit logging and increased timber-smuggling. India also plays a significant role as a destination country, and its import of illegal timber is the third largest globally, accounting for 10% of the global illegal wood trade. ##&& India is primarily a source country for illegally poached animals or animal products, especially pangolins, rhino horn and Bengali tigers, pushing them all onto the endangered species list. Nagpur is one of the main hotspots in the wildlife trade due to the city's proximity to eight wildlife reserves, and the Bahelia community from Madhya Pradesh has become famous over the past couple of decades for engaging in tiger poaching gained notoriety for tiger poaching in the past decades. Most illegal wildlife is moved by bus or train, but large numbers of Indian wildlife species and their derivatives have also been traded in online marketplaces. Similarly to the flora market, wildlife poaching in the country has expanded significantly following the COVID-19 lockdowns. ##&& Organized crime surrounding non-renewable resources, especially sand and gold, is widespread in India. Illegal sand networks \u2013 often referred to collectively as the 'sand mafia' \u2013 are made up of contractors, politicians, trade union leaders, local officials, corrupt policemen and revenue officials. The criminal networks involved are loose and decentralized, and operate throughout the country. Illegal sand mining has led to depletion of the water table, damage to crops, loss of livelihood for agricultural workers and a rise in violent crime, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. ##&& As for gold, India is one of the world\u2019s leading manufacturing centres and one of its largest smuggling hubs, with a third of the world\u2019s gold passing through its borders, amounting to more than 1000 tonnes a year. Smuggled gold originates predominantly from conflicts in Africa and South America as well as from the United Arab Emirates.","text - drugs":"The illegal cannabis market is one of India\u2019s most pervasive illicit drug markets. Cannabis cultivated in India is of high quality and enjoys worldwide demand. Domestically, cannabis has a large traditional and ceremonial role in Indian culture, and several major cities in India have among the highest cannabis consumption rates in the world. Despite its cultivation and trade being partially restricted, certain areas have legalized the cultivation of cannabis for medicinal and industrial use. ##&& Heroin is similarly highly pervasive in India, with the country playing a role as a source, transit and destination country for the drug. Despite eradication efforts, illegal poppy cultivation remains widespread in India, and the epidemic of domestic opiate addiction is growing. The north-eastern state of Manipur was the first hub for heroin to leave India through its border with Myanmar. Distribution networks in this region often enjoy the patronage of influential local politicians and corrupt policemen. The revenue is linked to funding arms trafficking along its border into Bangladesh. The western coast of India is a common entry point for heroin smugglers from Pakistan and Afghanistan moving heroin through India to Europe and North America, although the border is highly guarded and state intervention is more rigorous. Money earned from heroin trafficking in the west is reported to finance the activities of terrorist organizations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. ##&& Furthermore, India is a key production country, as well as a transit point, for synthetic drugs. Codeine-based drugs produced in India are trafficked through multiple exit points across the border and into Myanmar and Bangladesh, as are the drug yaba, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. A significant proportion of the Tramadol seized worldwide originates from India, and Tramadol addiction is spreading throughout the country. The cocaine market, on the other hand, is far smaller in scope in India. Nevertheless, cocaine smuggling has risen in recent years due to drug syndicates increasingly using the dark web and cryptocurrencies for distribution. Historically, cocaine is smuggled into the country by criminal actors from African states, but recently cocaine has been sourced from other destinations, such as Afghanistan and several countries in South America.","text - criminal actors":"A small number of mafia-style groups exist in India, the most prominent being the D-Company. This criminal group, which also engages in terrorist activity, uses Mumbai as its principal hub and operates in a number of criminal markets. In recent years, the group has diversified and expanded its international reach significantly. Furthermore, there are a number of groups in India, such as the People\u2019s Liberation Guerrilla Army and the Naxalites, that are primarily driven by ideological motives, but that systematically engage in organized criminal activity to generate income. These groups operate mainly in central and eastern areas and along the Indo-Myanmar border and Jharkhand. There are also various \u2018sand mafia\u2019 groups managing the illicit mining and trade of sand, and carrying out low-level violence against police and journalists investigating their markets. Loosely organized criminal networks feature heavily in India\u2019s organized-crime landscape. They are spread throughout the country and engage in a number of criminal markets, such as drug and human trafficking, as well as wildlife poaching. ##&& While the judiciary remains largely uncompromised and police involvement with mafia organizations is very limited, low-level state officials are more involved with poaching, trafficking and illicit mining, with participation ranging from facilitation to active management. The level of criminal activity and corruption within India\u2019s parliament is growing, and the economic damage caused by COVID-19 is likely to exacerbate this. With regard to foreign criminal actors, Nigerian nationals have a significant share of India\u2019s drug-trafficking market, particularly for heroin; Afghan nationals are also implicated. While there has been a rise in criminal activity by foreign nationals in states such as Goa, there is likely to be widespread resistance by an assertive and territorial Indian criminal underground.","text - leadership and governance":"India has a long history of the lines between organized criminal activity and politics being blurred. The high cost of running for election in India means that politicians often accept money and cede influence to criminal groups. However, criminal actors are increasingly not only financing elections, but also running for election themselves. The relationship between the Indian people, the government and law enforcement is increasingly fractured and India\u2019s central government is facing questions about its Hindu nationalist agenda. Furthermore, long-standing border disputes with Pakistan and China have created a fertile breeding ground for insurgents who engage in organized criminal activity. ##&& Corruption is widespread, especially at lower levels of government and the judiciary, where bribe payments are common, especially among the police. Attempts to improve accountability and transparency are visible in India, such as the creation of an anti-corruption watchdog agency, but criticisms have been levelled at the institution around lack of effective personnel and regulations, and an unwillingness to investigate all claims. Furthermore, despite a strong legal framework pertaining to access to information, the process is tainted by political interference. ##&& India has long focused on international cooperation to offset its limited capability to control terrorism and cross-border crime, cooperating with UN agencies as well as playing a leading role in regional groups on economic and anti-terror cooperation. India has also signed agreements with Myanmar to increase cooperation around human and drug trafficking, and extradition processes are generally effective. However, domestically federal anti-organized crime legislation is limited and piecemeal, compelling some states to implement their own legislation to bridge the gap. The lack of federal legislation means that Indian policing is reactionary rather than preventative, which leads to heavy caseloads for criminal investigators, and a slow and backlogged judiciary. ","text - criminal justice and security":"The Indian judiciary is under-resourced, which has led to an enormous backlog of cases pending. As such, prosecutions related to organized criminal activity are very limited. Similarly, Indian prisons are running at well over capacity and are constrained by lack of funding and staffing. This has led to substandard living conditions, violent clashes between inmates and guards, and corrupt practices facilitating the smuggling of contraband into prisons. India has among the lowest rates of police officers per capita of the world\u2019s major economies, and a lack of personnel afflicts many of its law enforcement agencies. Extrajudicial killings or encounter killings by the police have been a considerable issue in the country. However, the country has provided strong support to regional intelligence cooperation among South Asian countries against transnational organized crime and drug trafficking. ##&& India has long, conflicted borders, notably the highly volatile border with Pakistan, where there has been an increase of violence in recent years, as well as a long-standing border dispute with China. There are notable lacks in policy around irregular migration where the agency responsible is unable to properly check all ports and has to outsource this function to state police. The prevalence of cross-border terrorism and drug trafficking also demonstrates the lack of resources given to preventative customs units and collusion between some Border Security Force officials and transnational crime syndicates.","text - economic and financial environment":"India has considerable risk of money laundering (ML) and terror financing, in part, because money laundering only becomes an offence in association with a predicate crime. India\u2019s legislation is ineffective and has led to the country\u2019s ML watchdog convicting only 1% of cases, and the tax department convicting only 2%. Despite that, the country is taking steps to improve its legislative framework. The government is also attempting to strengthen financial surveillance and compliance in its bid to prevent capital flight. ##&& India\u2019s economic regulatory environment, on the other hand, has improved over recent years, but these improvements will have to compete with domestic protectionist impulses, which will not welcome foreign competitors at a time of rising unemployment. The intermittent reforms introduced by the government have not brought about tangible improvements to obstacles to doing business. Problem areas include tax-related administrative burdens, issues with property registrations and the low quality of the land administration system. ","text - civil society and social protection":"India boasts an active civil society, with over 3 million civil society organizations working in the country in variety of roles, including aiding marginalized groups, holding government officials and agencies accountable for their actions and advocating for human rights. However, as part of general efforts to strengthen the authority of the state, the government has been clamping down on such organizations, especially those with foreign funding, by restricting funding and official registration. ##&& Despite the Supreme Court ordering the implementation of witness protection schemes designed by the Home Ministry and devolved to each state, this has yet to be effectively actualized. Therefore, India is lacking adequate legislation around witness and victim protection, which has led to serious obstructions of justice, especially when the victims or witnesses are from socio-economically marginalized communities. India has no overarching prevention strategy against organized crime, other than the sections of its Code of Criminal Procedure that attempt to prevent crime more broadly. Insofar as prevention initiatives do exist, they are fragmented and change from state to state, and networks of NGOs have stepped in to provide training to community leaders in prevention of human-trafficking crimes. Additionally, there are awareness campaigns and community-policing initiatives in Bengali, which have proven effective in substantially reducing the number of human-trafficking crimes. ##&& Cases of attacks on journalists by police, Maoist fighters and criminal groups are significant in India. In 2018, six Indian journalists were killed because their work. In 2019, in the months leading up to the general elections, attacks by supporters of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party against journalists grew, with journalists in rural areas writing in local languages facing more danger.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"New Delhi","GDP (current $US million)":"2868929.42","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"1366417754","Land Area (sq. km)":"3287259","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"77","Freedom in the World Index":"67","Human Development Index":"0.65","Global Peace Index":"2.63","Democracy Index":"6.61","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"40","GDP per capita (current US$)":"2100","1":"5.53","1.1":"6.30","1.2":"4.75","2":"5.25"},{"Corresp":"78","ISO-3":"IDN","Country":"Indonesia","ISO-2":"ID","Continent":"Asia","Region":"South-Eastern Asia","Flag file":"id.png","1.

Smuggling flows from Indonesia have now shifted to Malaysia, with Indonesia\u2019s high rate of labour migration to Malaysia making smuggling more frequent between the two countries. Individuals who have themselves been smuggled into Indonesia work as recruiters and organizers of smuggling channels.

Illegal logging is a severe issue, with the market\u2019s grand scale being attributed to corrupt and powerful businessmen and local officials. Illegal logging often occurs in protected forest areas, access to which is made easier by the fact that logging companies legally manage adjacent forest areas. ##&& There is an enormous illegal wildlife market in Indonesia, among the largest in South-eastern Asia. The market mainly targets Sumatran tigers, cockatoos, monkeys, bats, parrots, elephants and orangutans. Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing also occurs on a significant scale in Indonesian waters. Poachers and wildlife dealers are predominantly domestic actors, while foreign fleets (Chinese, Vietnamese and Filipino) are for the most part engaged in IUU fishing in Indonesia. ##&& Illegal mining for gold and drilling for oil occur on a large scale in Indonesia. There are reportedly thousands of unlicensed mines, using mostly unlicensed equipment, which increases both safety and environmental damage risks. Indonesia suffers significant annual financial losses, estimated to be equivalent to billions of US dollars, from illegal gold mining. The market for illegal non-renewable resources is arguably among the largest in the region. Both locals and migrant workers engage in illegal mining operations in Indonesia, along with mining companies which either lack valid licences or mine resources in protected areas. Corruption plays an integral part in illegal mining, usually in the form of payments to low-level officials. There have also been serious allegations about the military failing to end illegal mining due to corruption.","text - drugs":"A heroin market exists in Indonesia, but it is comparatively small. Heroin is trafficked into the country from large regional producers such as Thailand, Laos and Myanmar. There are many reports indicating that state-embedded actors, especially in the Indonesian national narcotics agency (BNN), accept payments in return for facilitating the illicit trade in heroin and cocaine. In turn, Indonesia is a destination country for cocaine, with tourist hotspots such as Bali and Nusa Tenggara being especially prominent markets. ##&& Cannabis is prevalent in Indonesia and is used traditionally in the northern parts of Sumatra, especially in the Aceh region, where it holds religious as well as spiritual importance and is used in cooking and herbal medicine. The cannabis market in the country is operated mostly by locals and reportedly generates the equivalent of around US$1 billion each year. As with heroin and cocaine, corruption is rampant and state-embedded actors are used to facilitate trade in both cannabis and synthetic drugs. Synthetic drug use in Indonesia has been on the rise in recent years. While methamphetamine is the most popular synthetic drug in the country, there has been an increase in the use of new psychoactive substances, mostly synthetic cannabinoids.","text - criminal actors":"There is a wide spectrum of criminal networks allegedly involved in various forms of organized crime in Indonesia. For the most part, these criminal networks are involved in drug trafficking in the major cities, such as Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Yogyakarta and Medan, as well as in tourist destinations such as Bali. The latest operative information available suggests that there are 83 criminal networks engaged in drug trafficking in Indonesia. Human trafficking networks, on the other hand, are believed to exist primarily in rural areas, especially in eastern Indonesia. Terror-like operations are reportedly carried out by large criminal networks adhering to religious interests, but terrorist networks operate in Indonesia as well. Criminal networks are thought to significantly influence the democratic process in Indonesia, often through maintaining state-embedded connections, participating in political campaigns and buying votes. Corruption is rampant in the country at state and regional levels, and state-embedded actors facilitate a range of organized crime operations. In particular, prison and border control officers, as well as the BNN, aid drug trafficking. It is likely that state-embedded actors also exert control over criminal markets in the country and take an active part in them. ##&& Although the Indonesian government fails to recognise mafia-style groups, the Geng Sembilan (considered by experts to be such a group) has been present in Jakarta since the 1980s. The group, also known as Gang of Nine, 9 Naga and 9 Dragons, operates in various markets, most notably gambling, property and drugs. The group is characterized as a business racket with interests in the legal economy. While it does not control large territories and its membership is relatively small, the group has a monopoly on property and the drug trafficking market. Other mafia-style organizations are also operational in Indonesia and have ties to the police and military elite. There is anecdotal evidence of foreign involvement in certain criminal markets, such as human and drug trafficking, but foreign groups mostly collaborate with local organizations. Foreign actors operate primarily in tourist regions such as Bali and Nusa Tenggara, as well as across eastern Indonesia. Foreign motorcycle gangs have recently expanded their range and gained a foothold across the region, including in Indonesia.","text - leadership and governance":"The Indonesian government has taken a strong public stance against organized crime in national and international forums, with the issue featuring on both party and election agendas. Several internal separatist movements have threatened government resilience to organized crime, and corruption runs unchecked in the country. There is a functioning anti-corruption body \u2013 the corruption eradication commission (KPK) \u2013 which enjoys public trust; however, its ability to operate was severely curtailed by legislative amendments in 2019. In spite of the protests and rioting that ensued, the amendments were implemented. Although the government engages with civil society in anti-corruption efforts, many of its agencies lack the capacity and skills to deal with corruption. However, anti-corruption measures such as e-budgeting and procurement have been implemented, and the government is considered fairly transparent. ##&& Indonesia has signed and ratified all relevant international treaties pertaining to organized crime. Additionally, the government has stipulated international cooperation as one of its priorities in combating organized crime. In line with Indonesia\u2019s international commitments, its legal framework is able to respond adequately to current threats. Notably, however, the revision of the country\u2019s anti-corruption legislation has weakened the KPK and impeded its work. In addition, it has been recommended that Indonesia amend its conservation legislation to meet current environmental crime concerns. ","text - criminal justice and security":"There are no specialized anti-organized crime units within the judiciary, and \u2013 as in politics \u2013 corruption is pervasive in the judicial system. One consequence of this is that the judiciary\u2019s ability to pass effective sentences in cases involving organized crime may be compromised. The prison system is also plagued by issues and does not meet minimum international standards. Overcrowding and a lack of proper facilities are common, which has allowed criminal networks to organize and engage in crime, notably drug trafficking, within Indonesia\u2019s penal institutions, again collaborating with prison officers. The Indonesian national police force is tasked with countering organized crime, although a lack of training limits its anti-organized crime capacities. Indonesia both shares and receives intelligence from its partners, but corruption and political influence may have decreased trust among its partners and discouraged the practice. ##&& Apart from a forestry crimes section with dedicated investigators within the Department of Forestry, there are no specialized anti-organized crime units in Indonesia. The country lacks the necessary infrastructure to monitor its borders effectively, especially in its efforts to combat drug trafficking. In spite of the government claiming that the development of its border infrastructure has been a priority since 2014, the vast number of remote areas along Indonesia\u2019s maritime and land borders renders it particularly susceptible to transnational organized crime.","text - economic and financial environment":"Indonesia has AML\/CFT legislation in place. It has also demonstrated significant efforts to implement AML\/CFT recommendations and conduct financial investigations. Indonesia has a financial intelligence unit that is tasked with the prevention of money laundering, the analysis and investigation of financial transactions and data and information management. In spite of Indonesia\u2019s notable efforts in strengthening its AML\/CFT regulations, however, the risk of money laundering remains moderate. ##&& Significant progress in business regulation has been made, especially when compared with other countries in the region. E-commerce is growing fast in Indonesia, allowing businesses to reach larger audiences, but also presenting organized crime with more opportunities to sell drugs as well as illegal flora and fauna. There are some indications that organized crime has infiltrated the legal economy, especially in regard to gambling and real estate.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government supports victims of human trafficking and drug use, providing them with physical protection and medical, psychological and psychosocial services, as well as granting them procedural rights. Civil society has also been active in this respect, especially in assisting drug users and victims of drug-related crimes. There are witness-protection programmes, delivered by the witness and victim protection agency (LPSK). However, the LPSK is based in Jakarta and does not yet have any regional offices, which makes witness protection procedures low and access to safe houses difficult. ##&& In terms of prevention, national prevention strategies exist, with the focus being predominantly on human trafficking. While government efforts to combat human trafficking have increased, including establishing local and district-level inter-agency anti-human trafficking task forces, measures remain inadequate to address the problem fully. The government still lacks standard operating procedures for proactive victim identification and referral services. However, mechanisms are available for local communities to report organized crime through call centres, texts or online platforms. NGOs are active in supporting anti-drug and anti-human trafficking campaigns. Despite some friction between the government and the civil society sector, the former is generally supportive of non-state actors working against organized crime. ##&& Conversely, press freedom in Indonesia is poor, as evidenced by acts of violence against and the prosecution of journalists. Reportedly, journalists documenting environmental crimes are being increasingly targeted, as are foreign journalists and fixers, particularly those reporting on government or military irregularities. The cutting off of internet access has also been a tool used by the government to restrict the freedom of the press.

Iranians are trafficked abroad to the Gulf, the Caucasus and, to a lesser extent, Iraqi Kurdistan. Internal human trafficking also occurs, primarily between large cities such as Tehran, Shiraz and Tabriz. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has also allegedly forced victims to engage in combat in pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and Syria, although this remains disputed. Iran\u2019s human-trafficking market seems to have been at least partially hindered, however, by the COVID-19 pandemic. ##&& Human smuggling is also a significant issue in Iran and serves as a lucrative source of income for various criminal groups. Corrupt government officials also facilitate human smuggling. The human-trafficking and human-smuggling markets are closely intertwined, as many smuggled individuals have been exploited along their journeys. Human smuggling is especially prevalent along the Iranian\u2013Afghan and Iranian\u2013Turkish borders. Tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees and millions of Afghan refugees currently reside in Iran, and hundreds of thousands of Iranian refugees reside abroad. Widespread economic hardship and a lack of employment across the country exacerbate the human-smuggling market, especially for Afghan refugees and Iranians seeking better economic opportunities abroad. Economic hardship has been further aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and demand for the services of smugglers is expected to rise, although the pandemic also partially hindered Iran\u2019s human-smuggling market due to travel restrictions. The economies of Sistan and Urumiyeh, in particular, are largely dependent upon human smuggling.","text - trade":"Iran is one of the least transparent countries globally regarding arms exports. Due to strict gun control legislation and low rates of firearms possession, internal arms-trafficking in Iran is limited. However, regional arms-trafficking is a crucial part of the Iranian government\u2019s geopolitical strategy. Sanctions on Iran have rendered arms exports illegal, and state-embedded actors thus traffic arms across the Middle East and Southern Asia. Arms, ammunition, drones and other resources are trafficked to Iranian affiliates, allies and combat units in the Axis of Resistance. Iranian actors are also suspected of trafficking ballistic and cruise missiles across the Middle East and are known to export rifles to Syria and Gaza, as well as aiding the local production of arms in these destinations. Iranian involvement in arms trafficking has thus significantly led to the proliferation of illicit arms sales across the Middle East.","text - environment":"Iran has one of the largest oil reserves worldwide, and the country\u2019s oil exports have increased in recent years. However, due to the involvement of the IRGC in oil extraction, the US has placed sanctions on Iranian oil and the EU has also placed sanctions on Iranian oil exports to Syria. Illicit oil trading has engendered various socio-economic, geopolitical and environmental challenges both in Iran and across the region. Fuel smuggling also occurs in Iran\u2019s border regions, particularly in Baluchistan and Kurdistan. Smugglers also transport Iranian oil and subsidized fuel to neighbouring countries to be resold at higher prices. Oil smuggling often occurs alongside other cross-border crimes such as drug trafficking and human trafficking, and corrupt government officials play a significant role in facilitating the market. Not least of all, despite legislative measures taken, the illegal sale and smuggling of soil from Iran to neighbouring states is reportedly still ongoing. ##&& Since a 2017 ban on logging in the Hyrcanian forests, Iran\u2019s illicit logging market has largely diminished. Although independent loggers continue to engage in illicit logging in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, as well as in the Zagros forests, criminal groups are not believed to be involved. However, the illicit orchid-tuber market is a significant issue. Orchid tubers are smuggled out of Iran and into neighbouring countries or to Southern Asia for use in traditional drinks and medicines. Often they are smuggled alongside other products, such as nuts, or mislabelled and exported with false permits. Although less pervasive, poaching also occurs in Iran due to the presence of rare wildlife species. In particular, rare sheep and ram sub-species are poached for meat or to be used as trophies, especially in the Masjed mountain range. Wildlife smuggling is also believed to occur.","text - drugs":"Iran is a major transit country for Afghan-produced heroin. Heroin is primarily trafficked through Iran and onwards through the Balkans to Europe. However, heroin also accounts for more than half of drug consumption in Iran, and the country is one of the cheapest in which to buy heroin worldwide. Heroin addiction rates are thus extremely high, and heroin seizures are considerable in number. Heroin trafficking is largely facilitated by foreign organized-crime groups operating in Iran. Corrupt government officials, along with members of the IRGC, have been accused of involvement in heroin trafficking, although this remains disputed. However, US sanctions have been placed on high-ranking IRGC commanders due to allegations of heroin trafficking in Sistan-e-Baluchistan. Iran\u2019s heroin trade incites high levels of violence and has resulted in multiple violent clashes between Iranian border guards and traffickers. Economic devastation due to the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to boost the heroin trade as a means of generating revenue. Cannabis consumption is also a significant issue in Iran, although there is relative tolerance towards cannabis consumption compared to other drugs. Cannabis is primarily cultivated for the production of hashish rather than marijuana. Afghan hashish is also exported from and consumed in Iran. However, Iran has decreased in importance as a transit country for Afghan cannabis in recent years, largely due to the growth of other cannabis markets in the Middle East and North Africa. The home-cultivation and sale of cannabis are also believed to occur in Tehran, albeit on a smaller scale. Cannabis is primarily consumed by the middle class, and its higher price is attributed to the lack of sophisticated and large-scale networks involved in the trade. ##&& Iran is also one of the world\u2019s top methamphetamine producers. Most methamphetamine is trafficked out of Iran to other countries in the Middle East, Europe and South-eastern Asia. Methamphetamine is also trafficked into Iran, and Iranian criminals aid in the production of methamphetamine in neighbouring countries. The largest seizure of methamphetamine on record in Iran occurred in 2019, when officials seized 850 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine in Sistan-e-Baluchistan. Iran\u2019s methamphetamine market is expanding, as production labs are emerging across the country. The IRGC is suspected of involvement in methamphetamine production, as no known crime groups in the country possess the equipment and knowledge necessary to produce methamphetamine at the high quality that it is produced. However, methamphetamine consumption has slowed in recent years. Iran\u2019s cocaine trade remains minimal, although the IRGC has also been accused of involvement in cocaine trafficking and of harbouring links to Latin American drug cartels. There have also been accusations of both IRGC and Hezbollah involvement in cocaine trafficking between North America, West Africa and Europe, although these claims remain unsubstantiated. While Iran\u2019s cocaine trade does not induce local violence, cocaine profits are believed to aid IRGC-funded violence across the Middle East.","text - criminal actors":"Away from major Iranian cities, mafia-style groups wield significant power. These groups are made up mostly of religious leaders who protect the interests of people paying their dues to the local mosque. Gifts and donations secure favours and contribute to the resolution of disputes, obtaining business licences or building permissions, among others. While these groups do not operate overtly as criminal networks, they are considered mafia-like as they have the authority to confiscate land and act as a godfather who rewards loyalty. Most criminal activities are carried out by state-embedded actors and criminal networks. Economic hardship facilitates state-embedded corruption and involvement in criminal activities. Most criminal markets are controlled by state-embedded actors, especially the environmental-crime, drug-trafficking and human-trafficking markets. Corrupt government officials and judges have also been bribed by drug traffickers. While the IRGC has been extensively accused of involvement in organized crime, and is considered by some to be the country\u2019s main criminal organisation, this remains disputed. The IRGC has been labelled as a terrorist organisation by the US, although the international community has not followed suit. However, it is indisputable that the IRGC has had a significant impact on Iran\u2019s democratic process. ##&& Criminal networks typically specialize in one or two criminal markets, and violence is primarily related to the heroin trade. Loose criminal networks are also active in the human-trafficking and drug-trafficking markets and have links to foreign counterparts. Although criminal networks don\u2019t have a significant influence on the democratic process, drug profits are believed to have infiltrated the political arena. Foreign actors are not extremely active in Iran, largely due to the extreme precautions the Iranian government takes against foreign intervention. However, local criminals do cooperate with foreign counterparts, especially in transnational markets such as drug trafficking, human smuggling and fuel smuggling.","text - leadership and governance":"Iran is a highly fragile and vulnerable state with a dual governance system, comprising both democratic and religious elements. Democratically elected officials struggle to exercise leadership, as the country\u2019s religious supreme leader is not subject to checks and balances. This hinders the government\u2019s capacity to address organized crime, and many efforts to both combat organized crime and establish sustainable global partnerships have been impeded by the IRGC. Corruption is also a systemic issue in Iran, enabling both impunity and criminality to run rampant. Certain steps have been taken recently to clamp-down on corruption, but these efforts were perceived rather as politicized trials, where either people with links to reformists\/moderates or 'scapegoats' have been prosecuted. Anti-corruption mechanisms are frequently criticized for inefficacy, as they enable impunity among certain elements of the state apparatus. Access to information in Iran is also poor, as information that could be used against state interests is exempt from transparency laws. Democratically elected leaders can be held to account, but not those government elements under the command of the religious supreme leader, which enables extreme shortfalls of accountability and oversight. Nevertheless, there has been increasing support for moderate and reformist candidates in recent years, alongside increasing uprisings and protests. Traditionally pro-regime communities have also engaged in protest, illuminating the current regime\u2019s high level of vulnerability. Local insurgencies have also resulted in clashes between the IRGC and both Kurdish-affiliated and Baluch nationalist groups. ##&& Iran\u2019s efforts to engage in international cooperation are also negligible. However, the government cooperates with INTERPOL in efforts to increase Iranian law-enforcement capacity, and also with the UNODC to counter human trafficking, money laundering and cybercrime. In 2020, the UNODC opened a new capacity-building centre in Tehran promoting increased regional cooperation on drug crimes. Although Iran has signed and ratified a few select treaties and conventions related to organized crime \u2013 excluding the Arms Trade Treaty \u2013 enforcement remains limited. However, the country has strict drug laws, as well as laws against human trafficking. While the government has expressed intent to expand cooperation on extradition matters, fears of persecution in the country are likely to hinder such agreements.","text - criminal justice and security":"Iran also has a dual judiciary system. Although civilian courts have political independence, the Revolutionary Court system lacks political independence and specializes in offences deemed to endanger the Iranian regime. Unlike in civilian courts, individuals charged in the Revolutionary Court system lack access to legal defence, are not assigned juries and are often executed without delay. The Revolutionary Courts have thus been instrumental in the mass executions that have taken place in Iran throughout the previous decades. Iran had the second-highest rate of execution in the world in 2019 and most of the executed are prisoners of conscience. Although executions have decreased in recent years, they remain relatively high. Iran\u2019s judiciary system has also persecuted cases of corruption and targeted criminal networks in recent years, although this has allegedly been partially driven by political motives and efforts to regain public trust. Moreover, the judiciary tends to target only low-level criminals. Iranian prison standards are poor and prisons suffer from overcrowding. Prison officials have also denied food and medical care to prisoners, and both physical and psychological torture is common. ##&& Iranian law enforcement lacks specialized units targeting specific forms of organized crime. However, the Anti-Narcotics Branch targets drug crimes. In addition to the police, the Basij and various intelligence units under the IRGC engage in law enforcement, although their activities tend to focus on counterinsurgency. There is widespread corruption within law enforcement and security services are often poorly equipped and trained. Importantly, law enforcement agencies, particularly in the borderland regions, operate with little regard for human rights Iran\u2019s geographic positioning between continents, desert and mountainous terrain, and various maritime ports enable organized crime to flourish. The country\u2019s long borders are difficult to monitor and enforce. As such, border regions are the least secure in the country, and a host of armed opposition groups operate in these regions. Cross-border criminal activity is also facilitated by corrupt border officials and IRGC personnel, especially along Iran\u2019s border with Iraqi Kurdistan. Nevertheless, territorial integrity in Iran remains relatively strong.","text - economic and financial environment":"Iran is on the FATF blacklist, and also supports organisations widely designated as terrorist groups. Although steps towards the strengthening of the country's AML\/CFT capacity have been taken, including through the introduction of new legislation in recent years, major deficiencies remain. In particular, it is legal to finance foreign groups that fight foreign occupation, in effect rendering possible the financing of terrorist groups. The Iranian economy has also been severely hindered by US sanctions, corruption and criminality. Political actors wield significant control over the economy, limiting the political independence of legitimate business. The Basij and the IRGC control large swathes of the economy and the IRGC, in particular, exerts influence over most legal sectors. The Basij and the IRCG also engage in the extortion of businesses, making business operations in Iran extremely difficult.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Iranian government has shifted towards viewing people who use drugs as victims rather than criminals throughout the last decade, prior to which voluntary treatment programmes did not exist. Currently, various drop-in centres and clinics assist people who use drugs with harm reduction services and also provide treatment. Nevertheless, a highly punitive element to Iran's approach to drug use is still in place, with 'drug treatment camps' rife with corruption and human rights abuses being operational in the country. Iran also has a witness protection programme, although the government does little to aid human-trafficking victims and lacks the necessary framework for victim identification. Crime prevention strategies are also negligent, and largely ineffective. Most crime prevention strategies take the approach of deterrence through harsh punishment. ##&& Civil-society and media freedom in Iran is also very poor. The government has heavily cracked down on independent NGOs and environmentalists, as well as on protesters. Protestors have been killed on direct orders from the government, and journalists have been both imprisoned and executed. Nevertheless, civil society remains relatively active, especially in the arena of drug-abuse prevention. However, some civil society organisations have been co-opted by the state. The media is also heavily censored and restricted, although government criticism and political debate in Iran remains vibrant compared to other countries with similar media environments. Social media is also banned, and the government has taken efforts to curb the flow of information from outside of the country.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Tehran","GDP (current $US million)":"453996.48","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"82913906","Land Area (sq. km)":"1745150","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"84.5","Freedom in the World Index":"16","Human Development Index":"0.78","Global Peace Index":"2.67","Democracy Index":"2.20","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"25","GDP per capita (current US$)":"5550","1":"7.10","1.1":"6.95","1.2":"7.25","2":"3.50"},{"Corresp":"80","ISO-3":"IRQ","Country":"Iraq","ISO-2":"IQ","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Western Asia","Flag file":"iq.png","1.

Most human trafficking victims are subjected to sexual exploitation or forced labour, although organ trafficking also occurs, and many children are forced into begging or recruited into armed groups. Sexual exploitation remains by far the most common type of human trafficking, especially for female and child victims. The sex trafficking market is extremely lucrative and is facilitated by corrupt state-embedded actors issuing temporary marriage contracts. Women and children from minority groups are particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation and have been sold as slaves by terrorist organizations in the country. Rampant violence and insecurity in recent years have exacerbated vulnerability to human trafficking, especially for women and children, as well as for refugees and internally displaced people. ##&& Iraq\u2019s human smuggling market has also continuously expanded since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Iraqis constitute one of the largest groups of irregular arrivals to Europe, most often being smuggled along eastern Mediterranean smuggling routes. Many Iraqi nationals seek to be smuggled abroad due to devastated infrastructure, a lack of economic opportunity, weak political institutions, blackmailing and the difficulty of obtaining foreign visas. Many internally displaced people in particular seek the aid of smugglers to escape violence and instability that render certain regions of the country uninhabitable. Human smuggling is also particularly prevalent in Iraqi Kurdistan, from where many vulnerable individuals seek the aid of smugglers to reach Europe. Many Syrian refugees have also been smuggled into Iraqi Kurdistan and currently reside there. However, smuggled individuals are highly vulnerable to human trafficking, making it sometimes difficult to distinguish the two markets. As with the human trafficking market, bribery and corruption run rampant in Iraq\u2019s human smuggling market.","text - trade":"As a major recipient of foreign military aid and a significant transit country for weapons merchants across the Middle East, Iraq is highly vulnerable to arms trafficking. Weapons from decades of conflict remain in circulation, and weak border security, corruption and terrorism enable the arms trafficking market to flourish. An estimated third of both Iraqi and Kurdish citizens possess firearms, and due to Iraq\u2019s proximity to other regional conflicts in the Middle East, illicit arms proliferation has continued to rise, even after the defeat of ISIS in north-western Iraq. Black-market weapons are sold primarily in urban centres or online through social media, with Mosul in northern Iraq serving as a significant weapons hub. Many weapons from neighbouring countries, as well as Western-origin weapons such as handguns or light machine guns, are also smuggled into the country. Weapons diversion is a significant issue, with many small arms intended for use by the Iraqi military and law enforcement officials entering civilian markets instead. Weapons are also trafficked out of Iraq, primarily through Anbar province. Corrupt state-embedded actors largely facilitate the arms trafficking market.","text - environment":"Iraq has one of the largest oil reserves in the world, as well as enormous mineral wealth, including numerous metals such as uranium, gold and silver, among others. As such, the country\u2019s non-renewable resource illicit markets are flourishing, facilitated by rampant corruption and bribery among state-embedded actors. Oil trafficking constitutes the most pervasive market, and crude oil is often smuggled out of Iraq and into neighbouring countries or elsewhere in the Middle East. The oil trafficking market flourished throughout ISIS\u2019s rule in north-western Iraq, during which several illegal pipelines were installed; these are still there. Because of the engagement of corrupt state-embedded actors in oil trafficking, the market is also a significant source of internal conflict between Iraqi and Kurdistan Regional Government officials. Gas smuggling and mercury theft also pose significant challenges in Iraq. ##&& Fauna crimes also play a role in Iraq\u2019s illicit environmental economy. Licensed zookeepers often engage in the trafficking of exotic birds, the most sought after being high-value falcon species, through Iraq to other countries in the Middle East. Waterfowl in particular are commonly sold on the black market, both domestically and in neighbouring countries. The poaching and illicit trade pertaining to many other species, including wild goats, gazelles, flamingos, water chickens and the Euphrates soft-shell turtle, are also pervasive in Iraq. Increased poaching is connected to the proliferation of illicit weapons throughout the country, and also facilitated by corrupt government officials. The illicit flora trade, on the other hand, remains negligible, as many plant species no longer survive in the country due to the destruction of the Iraqi landscape from decades of conflict and the targeted burning of agricultural fields.","text - drugs":"Iraq is a haven for the international drug trade. Synthetic drug consumption has been steadily rising for more than a decade, and methamphetamine consumption in particular has risen in urban settings and prisons, even among youth and children. Methamphetamine is smuggled into Iraq from neighbouring countries through Basra province, and is also increasingly produced domestically. Recent information suggests Iraq is also becoming a waypoint for methamphetamine trafficked towards Turkey and potentially Europe. The abuse of prescription drugs such as Tramadol is also a significant issue, and the consumption of Captagon, which is smuggled into Iraq primarily from neighbouring and Central Asian countries, for the purpose of enhancing fighting capabilities, is also known to occur. Heroin consumption in Iraq is also rising, primarily in Basra province and in south-eastern Iraq, especially among youth and middle-aged adults. Opium is smuggled into Iraq from neighbouring and Central Asian countries. Heroin trafficking occurs in both Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan, and is trafficked out of the country to other Middle Eastern countries or to Europe. ##&& Although cannabis use was traditionally quite high in Iraq, largely due to its low price, the pattern seems to have subsided during the last decade, instead giving way to synthetic drug consumption. Najaf, Basra and Safwan are the most important drug trafficking hubs in the country, largely due to their proximity to its only maritime border. Militias throughout Iraq are believed to profit heavily from the drug trade. Iraq\u2019s cocaine trade is far less pervasive, but although domestic consumption is rare, cocaine is smuggled into Iraq from neighbouring countries and transited on to other countries in the Middle East.","text - criminal actors":"Mafia-style groups are involved in most of Iraq\u2019s criminal markets. These groups are especially active in the drug trafficking, arms trafficking, human trafficking, human smuggling and oil trafficking markets, and include a range of actors, as well as militias that employ mafia-style tactics to acquire funding. Reportedly, mafia-style groups in Iraq are expanding their control over certain parts of the country. The Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella organization for many militias and military figures in Iraq, have clashed with mafia-style actors in recent years, as militias increasingly turn towards mafia-style tactics such as illegal taxation, illicit-goods smuggling and extortion. Oil mafias are prevalent in northern Iraq, especially in Iraqi Kurdistan, and engage heavily in oil trafficking. Corrupt state-embedded actors are known to cooperate with mafia-style groups throughout the country. A diverse array of criminal networks also operate in Iraq, and are often organized along tribal lines. These networks engage in criminal activity such as oil trafficking, drug trafficking, human trafficking, robbery and assassination. High border porosity and a general lack of security throughout the country enable both mafia-style groups and criminal networks to flourish. ##&& Many criminal groups operating in Iraq have ties to corrupt state-embedded actors. Both Iraqi and Kurdistan Regional Government officials have been involved in domestic and transnational organized crime, accruing high levels of profit from activities such as arms trafficking, oil trafficking and illicit-goods smuggling. Corruption permeates nearly all levels of government, with many state-embedded actors operating at the executive and ministerial levels. Iraq has also long been susceptible to foreign influence; most criminal activities involve foreign actors who are citizens of neighbouring countries or elsewhere in the Middle East and Central Asia, although European and Latin American criminals have also been linked to criminal activity in the country. Iraq\u2019s lack of national security and poor border control makes the country a haven for foreign criminals.","text - leadership and governance":"Political leadership in Iraq is fragmented. Official government statements on security and intelligence are often contradictory and fail to reflect reality, and the allocation of government positions through a quota system based upon ethnicity also perpetuates ethno-sectarian tensions, in turn hindering government efficacy and fuelling the existence of patronage networks. Corruption is rife, and throughout the past decade the government has experienced an increasing crisis of legitimacy due to an intensification of protests against rampant corruption, elite criminality and foreign interference. The 2019 Tishreen Revolution, a massive uprising of civil society activists, was met with state violence and human rights abuses. Concrete efforts to combat organized crime are hindered by corruption and the criminal activity of state-embedded actors. ##&& Although the Iraqi government has expressed a commitment to combating certain forms of organized crime, including human trafficking, efforts remain limited and largely ineffective. Moreover, despite ratifying international conventions related to organized crime, with the exception of the Arms Trade Treaty, and establishing extradition treaties with various countries, Iraq\u2019s legislative framework remains ineffective. Legislation in both Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan pertains to a number of forms of organized crime such as human trafficking, oil trafficking and poaching, but law enforcement remains limited, as officials are often themselves implicated in such crimes. Internal government rivalries also hinder both government efficacy and the fight against organized crime. Moreover, the focus on the fight against ISIS in recent years, as well as on the current COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in the shifting of resources away from combating organized crime, in turn enabling criminal markets such as the drug trade to further expand.","text - criminal justice and security":"Rampant corruption threatens criminal justice and security in Iraq. Law enforcement capacity is limited, criminal procedures remain underdeveloped, corrupt state-embedded actors continue to engage in organized crime and criminal activity continues to rise. The judicial system is overburdened, and its efficacy is hindered by corruption, a lack of political independence, limited institutional cooperation, long delays and a lack of enforcement regarding both penalties and investigations into criminal activity. A lack of judges, lawyers and prosecutors also poses a significant obstacle to combating organized crime, and many judges have been threatened, and some killed, by various political actors and criminals. In addition, the dissolution of Iraq\u2019s security apparatus since the US invasion has ultimately led to the erasure of state responsibility for the protection of civilians, fueling crime and violence. Although some parts of the country are relatively secure, such as Iraqi Kurdistan, law enforcement officials lack control over many areas, especially desert regions, and have been largely replaced by local militias and tribal powers. ##&& Iraq\u2019s territorial integrity has also consistently deteriorated over the previous two decades. High border porosity enables cross-border organized criminal activity such as drug trafficking and human trafficking to flourish. Moreover, a lack of border security largely facilitated the country\u2019s infiltration by foreign fighters seeking to join ISIS. Since the defeat of ISIS, securing the country\u2019s borders has been a primary concern for the Iraqi government, along with preventing the resurgence of terrorism. Regardless, corruption among border officials remains pervasive and the lack of cooperation between border officials in Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan also threatens territorial integrity and security.","text - economic and financial environment":"The Iraqi government relies heavily on foreign aid, as well as on imported food and goods from neighbouring and Western countries, and on internal imports from Iraqi Kurdistan. Oil exports dominate the Iraqi economy, comprising just under half of the national GDP and accounting for almost all exports. The government faces pressure to further increase oil production in efforts to increase public revenue. Capital flight also poses a major economic challenge in the country, and its impact on high debt volumes, low business volumes and weak production has aggravated the country\u2019s unemployment crisis. Terrorism also remains a significant threat to economic stability, and pervasive corruption has eroded both living standards and economic recovery. As such, Iraq is one of the most difficult countries in which to do business. ##&& Iraq is highly susceptible to money laundering, lacking both a structured banking system and effective anti-money laundering mechanisms. Corruption hinders the establishment of international banking relationships, limiting possibilities for financial transactions, and also rendering the economy largely cash based. Many rely on the informal hawala system for both small and large financial transfers. Although the Iraqi government has cooperated with international institutions to improve the country\u2019s economic regulatory environment, progress has yet to materialize. Legislation criminalizing both money laundering and terrorist financing was passed in recent years, also prompting the establishment of monitoring mechanisms, but corruption and the circumvention of such regulations have made the legislation ineffective.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim and witness support services are severely lacking in Iraq. Despite government efforts to identify human trafficking victims, major deficiencies persist, and law enforcement officials lack necessary training in victim identification methods. Awareness campaigns for human trafficking are also significantly lacking. While welfare shelters for female victims exist, predominantly in Baghdad, the state neither recognizes nor supports these shelters, forcing them to operate clandestinely. Moreover, despite rising drug consumption having overburdened the Iraqi health care system, little support is extended to those affected. Government inaction is thus a significant barrier to effective crime prevention strategies. ##&& While Iraqi civil society is relatively active, a lack of collaboration among the abundance of civil society organizations in the country makes it difficult to establish civil society\u2019s role in the fight against organized crime. Foreign NGOs also provide significant amounts of aid to Iraq. However, the country remains one of the worst in the world for media freedom, and there is a significant lack of transparency regarding public information. Criticism of the government is harshly punished, and many journalists face kidnapping or murder. Since the Tishreen Revolution, rates of harassment, kidnapping, violence and murder against journalists have increased, especially towards those who have criticized the government.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Baghdad","GDP (current $US million)":"234094.04","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"39309783","Land Area (sq. km)":"435052","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"96.2","Freedom in the World Index":"29","Human Development Index":"0.67","Global Peace Index":"3.49","Democracy Index":"3.62","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"21","GDP per capita (current US$)":"5955","1":"7.05","1.1":"6.35","1.2":"7.75","2":"3.79"},{"Corresp":"82","ISO-3":"ISR","Country":"Israel","ISO-2":"IL","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Western Asia","Flag file":"il.png","1.

Arguably, migrants who come to seek work in the country are vulnerable to exploitation, as are refugees and asylum seekers. Women who willingly travel to Israel to work in prostitution may also end up in exploitive situations. In addition to sexual and labour exploitation, victims in Israel may be trafficked for sham marriages, forced begging or for child bearing. Victims of forced labour and sexual exploitation come mostly from Southern and South-eastern Asia, the Palestinian territories and the former Soviet Union. Most refugees and asylum seekers are Eritrean or Sudanese. The actors involved in human trafficking range in their degree of organization, but given the nature and mechanism of forced prostitution in particular, it is very likely that some criminal networks operating in Israel have ties to criminal networks in victims\u2019 countries of origin. ##&& Due to strained relations with neighbouring countries and the fact that Jordan is not along major human- smuggling routes, the only route through which human smuggling occurs is the Israeli border with Egypt. The majority of irregular migrants in Israel used to come from Eritrea, Sudan, Ghana and Nigeria, but human-smuggling flows, unlike flows of other illicit goods moving through, have dissipated with the completion of the southern border fence along the Egypt\u2013Israel border in 2013.","text - trade":"Given the decades-long conflict between Israel and Palestine, a lot of illegal weapons have as their final destination either Israel or the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Trafficking flows abound, but often weapons are smuggled from Lebanon and Jordan into Israel, from the West Bank into Israel, or from the Gaza Strip to the West Bank through Israel. Israeli authorities have also thwarted multiple attempts to smuggle military gear and weapons into the Gaza Strip via sea routes. Smugglers vary from individuals to small networks. In addition, Israel is also a firearms manufacturer and a major small-arms exporter. The country has allegedly been supplying rogue regimes as well as militias with weapons in breach of embargoes.","text - environment":"There is no evidence to suggest a flora-related crimes market exists in Israel. Similarly, very few reports of fauna crimes have been recorded, which suggests the criminal market is small. There are, however, allegations of involvement in illegal procuring, selling and exploitation of other countries\u2019 natural resources. Accusations mainly stem from the exploitation of natural resources in the Palestinian territories and the Syrian Golan Heights, as well as the procurement of African rough diamonds. Reportedly, the diamond trade is one of the biggest markets in Israel, accounting for a significant portion of the country\u2019s national gross income. Rough diamonds are sourced from South Africa, Sierra Leone, Angola, Congo, Liberia and Ivory Coast, as well as Russia and Canada. Reports claim Israel has made deals with militant groups in Africa that source blood diamonds in return for weapons.","text - drugs":"Although heroin use is less common than other drugs in Israel, it is on the rise, especially in big cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Both Israeli nationals and foreign actors are involved in trafficking heroin into or through Israel. The level of organization of criminal structures engaged in the trade varies, but information suggests domestic mafia-style groups have a stake as well. Heroin, like cocaine, enters Israel mainly from Jordan, and is then either distributed in the country or trafficked into Egypt or Saudi Arabia. Cocaine, however, may also be smuggled to Israel straight from Latin America along sea routes. In terms of criminal actors involved, there are indications that criminal networks with ties to foreign groups traffic cocaine into Israel. It has also been noted that Israel is becoming a major cocaine-trafficking hub because of its strategic location at the crossroads between several drug-trafficking corridors. Likely, as a consequence of that, demand for cocaine among \u2018white-collar\u2019 Israelis is increasing, as is the social acceptance of cocaine use. ##&& Cannabis is the most prevalent illicit drug in Israel. Recreational use of marijuana was decriminalized in 2017, with hundreds of cannabis farms subsequently applying for a licence to grow marijuana, making Israel a large legal exporter of medical cannabis and a major destination market. Nevertheless, Israel remains a transit and destination country for the illegal cannabis trade as well. Allegedly, the smuggling channel \u2013 primarily for marijuana and hashish \u2013 crosses the Israel-Jordan border and even goes though Israel. Synthetic drugs are also very prevalent in Israel, especially LSD and Ecstasy. Synthetic drugs are trafficked into the country along the same routes used to smuggle cocaine, heroin and cannabis. In addition, however, synthetic drugs are smuggled into the country by air.","text - criminal actors":"Mafia-style groups are the most prominent criminal actor type in Israel, with different entities having various levels of organization, membership and field of operations \u2013 prostitution, extortion, protection, drug dealing, gambling, investment fraud, arms trafficking, illegal quarrying and loan sharing. Since leadership usually depends on family ties, Israeli mafia-style organizations have a well-known boss and, in most cases, defined successor. Israeli mafia-style groups operate in certain territories across the country \u2013 northern and southern Tel Aviv, the northern parts of the country and in Arab communities, and claim sole control over turf, but there is no evidence that authorities cannot access these territories. There is also no information to suggest mafia groups exert control over prisons, but there are reports of inmates belonging to criminal groups terrorizing other inmates and even guards. Israeli mafia groups have easy access to weapons and are very violent, having a long history of clashes and wars with one another. Clashes have at times resulted in members defecting from a given structure to form a new organization. Criminal networks also exist in Israel. These are made up of smaller groups that have no leadership or clear structure. Reportedly, the latter run nightclubs where victims are sexually exploited. Other criminal networks are involved in drugs and arms trafficking. ##&& State actors are not generally involved in organized crime on a wide scale. There have, however, been reports of state actors controlling, engaging in or facilitating criminal markets, most notably cocaine smuggling, investment scams and exploitation of Palestinian natural resources along with the blood diamond trade. Some immigrants in Israel have reportedly resorted to prostitution or selling drugs, but there is no evidence they control any criminal market.","text - leadership and governance":"As Arab community leaders express concerns over the Israeli police\u2019s ability to counter organized crime in their communities, little appears to have been done in respect of countering it. Domestic organized crime does not feature on the political agenda, yet international observers note that it remains a serious concern to the country. Conversely, Israel has made its plans to fight Hezbollah\u2019s organized crime activities in Latin America a top priority. Moreover, then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was indicted in 2019, standing accused of bribery, fraud and abuse of power. Thus, the issue of corruption is becoming even more apparent, while public trust in authorities and the prime minister himself is declining. Political instability, evident in Israel holding three elections in less than 12 months from April 2019 to March 2020, does not improve matters either. Anti-corruption laws are in place, but with the exception of the state comptroller, there does not seem to be any special mechanisms to fight corruption. In practice, the state comptroller has been acting as an anti-corruption watchdog for over a decade, launching several investigations into high-level politicians suspected of corruption. The current state comptroller, however, is far less aggressive than his predecessors and it seems the office will forgo its anti-corruption-related functions under its current term. Nevertheless, on a global scale, corruption perceptions in Israel are moderate. Conversely, access to information in the country is rather poor. ##&& Israel is party to most relevant conventions and treaties pertaining to organized crime. The country has also signed an agreement with Europol to increase bilateral efforts in the fight against organized crime, cybercrime and terrorism. With that said, however, international law enforcement bodies have expressed frustration over Israel\u2019s reluctance to tackle financial crime as well as its inability to arrest and hold accountable individuals accused of fraud. Israeli passport holders are not usually subject to extradition, and even if extradited and convicted abroad, Israeli nationals are allowed to serve their sentence in Israel. In line with Israel\u2019s international commitments to fighting organized crime, the country\u2019s national policies and laws are able to adequately respond to current organized crime threats. In particular, significant efforts to combat human trafficking have been made, evident in the country\u2019s eighth consecutive year as a Tier 1 country on the US State Departments Trafficking in Persons Report. Anti-drug legislation is also very strict, allowing law enforcement agencies greater powers to seize and destroy dangerous substances. In contrast, recreational use of marijuana was decriminalized in 2017.","text - criminal justice and security":"The state attorney is the main body that manages cases related to organized crime in Israel, with professional judges adjudicating on all criminal proceedings. A specialized unit, the National Anti-Trafficking Unit, exists within the Ministry of Justice to advise on anti-trafficking policy, advance legislation and procedures to promote anti-human trafficking and protect trafficking victims. The Israeli prison system has often been criticized for poor living conditions, inhumane treatment and torture, as well as racial profiling (particularly of Palestinian inmates). While there is no evidence that prisons have been taken over by organized crime, the Israeli prison system has reported crackdowns on inmates who belong to mafia-style groups and who have terrorized other inmates and guards. This comes in light of alleged organized-crime-related coordinated attacks on prisons, motivated by poor living conditions experienced by certain inmates. Israeli police has the National Anti-Trafficking Coordination Unit within its ranks, which is dedicated to fighting human trafficking. The unit, however, comprises different government institutions and has only one police officer. In addition, the Israel Anti-Drug Authority was restructured in 2016 to become the Authority for Prevention of Violence, Alcohol and Drug Abuse, part of the Ministry of Public Security. Importantly, Israeli law enforcement reportedly suffers under corruption as well as a lack of funding and other resources. Additionally, organized crime is not as high on the agenda as terrorism, which to an extent has impeded anti-organized crime efforts. Much of the Arab world does not recognize Israel as a state. As a result of the country\u2019s strained relations with neighbouring states, military tensions run high in the region. Most recently, Israel annexed the Syrian Golan Heights, defying international law and furthering tensions. Israel also occupies part of Lebanon, while Hezbollah controls the southern Lebanon-Israel border. Hamas, the de facto governing body of the Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian Authority, which controls parts of the West Bank, are also sources of tension within Israel.","text - economic and financial environment":"Israel boasts a strong anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism framework, underpinned by effective mechanisms for identifying, investigating and disrupting money laundering. Thus, Israel is resilient to money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Notably, the country is not on any money laundering blacklists, but is subjected to financial sanctions by the Arab League, out of solidarity with the Palestinian people. Despite the good progress made in anti-money laundering, more efforts are needed, especially in NGO supervision and the prevention of the use of non-profit organizations for terrorist financing. Similar to its anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism framework, Israel\u2019s economic regulatory capacity is strong enough to ensure businesses operate free of criminal interference. With that said, however, there are certain sectors that have deep ties to organized crime, including gambling, entertainment (nightclubs) and the diamond trade.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Israeli government has a fairly robust framework in place to provide support to victims of modern slavery, and authorities maintain efforts to protect trafficking victims. Along with shelter, legal assistance, medical and psychosocial support, the government either grants victims of human trafficking a year-long unrestricted work visa or provides documents that frees those who do not wish to stay in Israel of criminal responsibility and prosecution for migration violations. Israel also has a witness protection programme that grants protection to witnesses prior to, during and after trials, and provides for relocation of witnesses and their families. In terms of prevention, the Israeli government has mechanisms in place that focus on human trafficking and drug use in particular. Along with a five-year prevention plan to raise awareness of human trafficking introduced in 2019, a very detailed programme for the prevention of drug use is also in place. Notably, there are protections for whistle-blowers as well as psychological and legal aid at their disposal. NGOs play a key role in responding to organized crime in Israel, particularly with respect to human trafficking. For instance, it was due to the lobbying efforts of NGOs that the Knesset amended Israeli penal law to prohibit sex trafficking in 2000. Israeli media generally enjoy a great deal of freedom, but journalists are often subjected to hostility, verbal attacks by government officials. A degree of self-censorhip is prevalent in Israel and violence against journalists, particularly Palestinian journalists, does take place.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Jerusalem","GDP (current $US million)":"394652.21","Income group":"High income","Population":"9054000","Land Area (sq. km)":"22070","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"43","Freedom in the World Index":"76","Human Development Index":"0.92","Global Peace Index":"2.78","Democracy Index":"7.84","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"60","GDP per capita (current US$)":"43589","1":"4.42","1.1":"4.20","1.2":"4.63","2":"6.00"},{"Corresp":"85","ISO-3":"JPN","Country":"Japan","ISO-2":"JP","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Eastern Asia","Flag file":"jp.png","1.

Similarly, women and children from East Asia, South-eastern Asia, South America, Russia and Central America who initially undertake the journey to Japan for the purposes of employment or sham marriages are reported to be subsequently trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation or forced prostitution. ##&& In addition to transnational trafficking, domestic trafficking has emerged as an issue in Japan. Most of the identified victims are women and children who have been forced into performing sexual services in order to pay off illegal loans. Human trafficking in Japan is a highly organized illicit economy in which sophisticated criminal networks, often transnational in nature, operate. Japan is also a transit country for people being trafficked from Eastern Asia to North America. Human smuggling, on the other hand, is generally facilitated by the Yakuza and Chinese Triads in the country, with Japan acting as a popular destination country for people travelling irregularly from China and other countries in the region.","text - trade":"Japan has among the lowest rates of gun crime in the world, largely due to strict restrictions on gun possession. Although Japan has an incredibly small domestic market for illicit arms, seizures of weapons from organized crime groups (\u2018Boryokudan\u2019) are not uncommon, who smuggle arms into the country hidden among shipments of legal goods.","text - environment":"As a large importer of wildlife products, Japan is vulnerable to becoming a destination country for flora and fauna crimes. Japan is a major consumer of wood-based products and imports more plywood from tropical forests than almost any other country. Many of Japan\u2019s timber imports come from regions with a known prevalence of illegal logging. Import regulations are lax, allowing illegally logged wood to make up a substantial amount of the country\u2019s timber imports. ##&& Japan is also exposed to flows from criminal fauna markets. It has one of the world\u2019s largest markets for the ivory trade, which operates legally and in the open. Many criminal actors use Japan to engage in so-called ivory laundering, whereby ivory is fraudulently declared as legal. At the same time, however, there is evidence that the market for ivory is in decline. There is also a significant demand for exotic pets on the Japanese market, and trade in threatened species \u2013 including slow lorises, otters, owls and pythons \u2013 is known to occur. Illegal pet markets in Japan are mainly supplied by Thailand, mainland China, Indonesia and Hong Kong. There are multiple risks associated with illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in Japan on both the demand and supply side of the consumer market. Domestic fishermen fish illegally in Japanese waters and then export their illicit catch, but fish caught illegally abroad is also imported into Japan. Japan is the world\u2019s largest consumer of high-value fish, such as bluefin tuna. Combined with lax traceability requirements, this appetite for seafood makes Japan vulnerable to importing large amounts of IUU seafood. ##&& Non-renewable resource crimes are the least pervasive form of environmental crime in Japan, but there have been isolated cases of gold being smuggled into the country, primarily from Hong Kong and Taiwan, among other Asian countries, by criminal networks seeking to bypass taxes on the precious metal. Furthermore, identification documents required by gold traders to be able to reclaim taxes on gold purchased abroad are often forged.","text - drugs":"Japan is primarily a destination country for various drugs. For the most part, few drugs transit or are produced on Japanese territory. Domestic consumption is highest in cannabis and synthetic drugs, whereas heroin and cocaine consumption rates are low (particularly when compared with consumption rates in countries with similar income levels). Currently, the fastest growing and most lucrative drug market in Japan is the criminal market for methamphetamine. The price of methamphetamine in Japan is several times higher than it is in neighbouring countries, largely due to the high demand. Methamphetamine is smuggled into Japan primarily from Central and South America, the Middle East and South-eastern Asia, but in the last decade the African continent has been the source of much of the methamphetamine that has been seized, possibly due to a crackdown against Chinese suppliers. ##&& Cannabis is also consumed on a relatively large scale in Japan, particularly by younger generations, and usage has increased substantially in recent years. With the exception of a handful of relatively small cannabis cultivation sites, almost all the illegal drugs consumed in Japan are imported from overseas and distributed on the local market by mafia-style criminal organizations.","text - criminal actors":"While all types of criminal actors have a presence in Japan, the criminal ecosystem of the country revolves around mafia-style actors. There are slightly more than two dozen designated mafia syndicates (legally referred to as the Boryokudan or Yakuza). The three largest, which account for approximately 70% of all syndicate members in Japan, are the Yamaguchi-gumi (accounting for 50% of all the Yakuza in Japan and subdivided into three factions, which are all rivals), the Sumiyoshi-kai and the Inagawa-kai. The different Yakuza are involved in various criminal markets to different extents. Some \u2013 the Yamaguchi-gumi, for instance \u2013 formally forbid their members from engaging in drug trafficking (although many do still operate in the drug markets), whereas other Boryokudan are heavily involved in the criminal market for drugs. ##&& Overall, the various Boryokudan throughout Japan are engaged in criminal markets such as human smuggling, prostitution, arms and drug trafficking, illegal gambling and real estate. Boryokudan membership has decreased steadily over the past decade, although the number of arrests has increased significantly. While the Yakuza have been in decline and increasingly ostracized by Japanese society, due in large part to the Yakuza exclusion ordinances that were enacted between 2010 and 2011, new groups operating under a looser and more decentralized structure have emerged. Sometimes referred to as the Hangure, these groups have partially filled the vacuum left by the Boryokudan, but also operate on a less professional basis and engage in more petty crime. However, they often operate with ruthless violence and engage in organized fraud. ##&& Ties between organized criminals and Japanese politicians have been common for decades but have been reduced in recent years as public opinion on the Yakuza and organized crime in general has become increasingly intolerant. Nevertheless, in recent years, there have been a number of cases of high-ranking officials in the Liberal Democratic Party having ties to organized crime, and there are still accusations that cabinet members have associations with criminal actors. Foreign criminal actors and mafia-style groups with a presence in Japan include groups of West African and Chinese origin, who work together with the Yakuza.","text - leadership and governance":"Japan is a mature democracy with consolidated political, civil and personal liberties and high levels of stability. Nevertheless, the Japanese government lacks leadership on counter-trafficking and organized crime and often displays a reluctance to introduce legislation that would place tougher limits on criminal flows such as environmental crimes and human trafficking. The level of corruption in Japan is perceived to be fairly low, and levels of transparency are high. Nevertheless, while access to information legislation allows individuals to request information from government agencies, in practice the law has not always been implemented effectively. Furthermore, the Yakuza, who specialize in financial crime and fraud, frequently extort money from corporations and bribe politicians. While the level of social and political embeddedness of the Yakuza is being weakened, there is still progress to be made. ##&& Japan is an active partner in the international architecture for countering organized crime and takes leadership in a number of areas of international cooperation. The Japanese police have recently enhanced cooperation with Europol and also host an INTERPOL National Central Bureau, regularly taking part in global INTERPOL-led police operations which focus on regional organized crime. Japan is an active and important donor in international development cooperation, which is aimed at tackling illicit drugs, combating terrorism and strengthening law enforcement. Furthermore, Japan has either acceded to or ratified all relevant treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, including UNTOC, which was ratified in 2017, along with UNCAC. Domestically, Japan\u2019s legislative framework covers a wide range of organized crime types, including human smuggling, environmental crimes, money laundering and trafficking in people, drugs and arms. In 2020, the government set out plans to revise the country\u2019s tax framework in order to prevent gold from being smuggled into Japan. However, Japan\u2019s legal framework to counter human trafficking has some deficiencies. While it has criminalized sex and labour trafficking through various laws related to the prostitution of adults and children, child welfare, immigration and employment standards, Japan does not have a comprehensive anti-trafficking statute that includes definitions in line with international standards.","text - criminal justice and security":"Japan\u2019s judiciary is independent, efficient and reliable. Due process generally prevails in trials and the rule of law is strong. There are complaints about detention facilities, but in general the security and standards of prisons in Japan live up to global standards. Japan\u2019s national police agency has a number of specialized bureaus and units working on organized crime. While these are effective, law enforcement agencies are faced with legal constraints that in some cases prevent intelligence-sharing with foreign nations in international drug investigations and make it difficult for the law enforcement agencies to proactively investigate members of transnational criminal organizations who operate inside the country. Japan sits on a maritime and air crossroads between Asia, the South Pacific and the Americas. This geographic location, compounded by Japan\u2019s extensive coastline and trade infrastructure, as well as the fact that it is one of the world\u2019s leading economies, make the country potentially attractive to local, regional and global organized crime groups.","text - economic and financial environment":"Japan\u2019s economic and regulatory environment is conducive to private investment and makes it relatively easy to do business. Japan's organized crime groups still control a significant part of the country\u2019s private sector, particularly construction, but in general there are few constraints to private sector development and doing business. ##&& Japan is increasingly vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing. It has adopted strong measures against these two issues, requiring all financial institutions to adopt risk-based approaches. Although the country does not have any major strategic deficiencies in its AML\/CFT framework, the number of money laundering cases has increased significantly in recent years. One source of vulnerability is believed to be the relatively large number of internationally connected small or medium enterprises, whose overseas transactions can easily be disguised. ","text - civil society and social protection":"Japanese authorities and NGOs provide some social protection services for victims of crimes such as human trafficking (including shelters, hotlines and counselling), as well as reintegration and repatriation services. Despite the existence of these services, more could be done to provide social protection for victims, and many foreign victims of human trafficking do not enjoy full access to all these services. Moreover, the government has been criticized for lacking the political will to adequately prevent human trafficking. ##&& While in general the space for independent media is respected in Japan, whistle-blowers, journalists and bloggers can face prison if convicted of publishing information that has been classified as secret. Moreover, organized crime groups such as the Yakuza hold some influence over journalist communities.

Victims are mainly sourced from Syria, Egypt, Southern and South-eastern Asia, and East Africa. Individuals migrate to Jordan from surrounding countries looking for work and become vulnerable to exploitation, with trafficked men often employed in forced labour and female refugees forced into marriage and sexual exploitation. In refugee camps, children are at risk of being recruited for illicit activities related to drugs, forced labour and forced marriage. The criminal actors running the groups are often foreigners, who bribe low-level law enforcement officials to facilitate their activities. ##&& With regard to the transnational human smuggling market, Jordan is mainly an origin and destination country. Smugglers use social media websites to identify those wishing to migrate to Europe; they then obtain false identification documents and ship them through transit countries into Europe. The Kafala (sponsorship) system used to monitor migrant labourers in Jordan has been criticized for creating more demand for smuggling. The deterioration of the security situation in Syria led to the proliferation of human smuggling networks across the border from Jordan, which were effectively monopolized by tribal groups.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking in Jordan is significant and has increased in recent years, primarily due to the crisis in Syria. The two-way arms trafficking over the border is often run by Bedouin tribes, some of whom have links with terrorist organizations and regime forces in Lebanese Hezbollah. In particular, weapons are sold in a number of \u2018arms bazaars\u2019, particularly in Ma\u2019an, Sahab and in the Jordan valley, where anyone who can afford it can purchase a firearm. Arms possession is normalized within Jordan, where domestic demand for weapons accounts for 90% of the total demand, while the remaining arms travel on to Palestinian territories. The government has made some progress in clamping down on weapons smuggling across the border, aided by stability inside the West Bank and the collapse of ISIS.","text - environment":"Flora crimes are mainly concentrated in the illegal logging market, with the forests of Jerash and Ajloun especially targeted by illegal loggers. This is a particular concern as Jordan only has 1% forest cover, and wildfires are often used to destroy forest to make logging easier. The flora crimes market is mainly driven by the needs and demands of the local population, as residents with low incomes resort to illegal logging to cover their needs for heating. The conflicts in places such as Syria and the Gaza Strip have significantly impacted natural habitats and created a market for wildlife smuggling in which Jordan acts primarily as a transit country. However, Jordan also has its own problem of illegal poaching and hunting that has led to more species being added to the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species. Finally, although in past years ISIS engaged in illegal oil smuggling from Iraq through Jordan and Syria, since the fall of their last territorial holdings this illicit activity has decreased significantly.","text - drugs":"Cannabis is the most widely consumed and available drug in Jordan, most commonly originating from Afghanistan and Lebanon. All distribution networks are supervised on the Syrian side by Hezbollah, which relies on Syrian and Jordanian merchants to coordinate the trafficking operations. Jordan also has an important synthetic drug market, with an increasing amount of Captagon reaching its youth population from production sites in Syria and Lebanon. Another cheap synthetic drug, named Joker, is synthesized in Jordan and is similarly widespread; it is also smuggled in high quantities into the Gulf countries. While cocaine is not widely available or used in Jordan, the trafficking of cocaine from Syria into Jordan has increased considerably in recent years, which has been reflected in the increasing number of arrests. Jordan only has a small domestic market for heroin, and is generally used as a transit country, moving heroin into the Gulf countries and Europe.","text - criminal actors":"While there is no evidence of mafia-style groups operating in Jordan, there are criminal networks largely based on historical tribal connections operating throughout the border provinces. Bedouin tribes on the Syrian border are involved in the smuggling of arms and drugs and have links to various parties including ISIS and Hezbollah. Although the networks operate all over the country, they are mostly concentrated in the vicinity of refugee camps, hotels and universities. Corruption is also a significant problem in Jordan, particularly within the security forces that operate along the borders. These state-embedded networks are often extensions of clan and tribal structures, especially prevalent inside the security services. Senior members of the networks attempt to buy allegiances from communities to allow their criminal operations to run smoothly with money sourced from Hezbollah. Interaction with foreign criminal groups is high, with ties often forged in efforts to cross international borders. Palestinian, Iraqi and Syrian actors have been identified as being involved in various criminal markets in Jordan.","text - leadership and governance":"Compared to neighbouring countries, Jordan is politically stable. It has numerous government agencies that link Jordanian law enforcement agencies to their international counterparts and play a major role in protecting the country from the expansion of international organized crime. The government has established various law enforcement departments to try and control the borders and prevent the smuggling of drugs. However, the number of terrorists moving from Jordan into Syria is becoming a concern, and the government has moved to prevent them returning to Jordan. Jordan\u2019s government makes attempts to be accountable and transparent, but these are often sporadic and inconsistent. For example, in adherence to the UNCAC, Jordan publishes information about criminal cases it refers to the judiciary, but there are often inconsistencies in the information given to the public, especially in high-profile cases. Furthermore, despite top government officials being investigated and sometimes charged with corruption, Jordan's penal code is not implemented effectively and corrupt officials often operate with impunity. Jordanian authorities also increased the arrests of protesters and anti-corruption activists in 2019, detaining dozens and charging them on the basis of vague provisions under the law to limit their freedom of expression. ##&& Jordan is heavily reliant on foreign assistance and therefore has a good record in international cooperation. It is a signatory to the Statute of the International Criminal Court, and INTERPOL\u2019s intervention is undertaken through the National Central Bureau, which is embedded within regional programmes. Jordan has for decades been keen to comply with extradition processes as part of bilateral or regional treaties. While there is an intention to pass national laws to prevent organized crime, most fail to be implemented effectively. The anti-human trafficking legislation created new units and departments to manage this crime; however, authorities have fallen short in its implementation. Notably, forms of punishment for sex trafficking are not compatible with penalties for other offences, and there are no provisions for victims\u2019 rights, while laws around firearms control are also insubstantial and fail to produce results. Jordan has legislated against most other areas of organized crime but is struggling to enforce these laws effectively.","text - criminal justice and security":"Civilian courts in Jordan are generally perceived as transparent and procedurally sound. Nevertheless, a significant case backlog exists because of inefficiency in the sector. Furthermore, court orders are often ignored by authorities. The structure of the justice system reflects good democratic principles, with the separation of powers protected in the constitution and the independence of the justice system guaranteed; however, there remain allegations of nepotism and special-interest influence. The reality of the prison system is very mixed, with allegations of widespread torture and human rights violations, standing alongside a strong emphasis on rehabilitation, with inmates receiving education and training to be able to contribute to society outside prison. Jordan has fulfilled its international commitments regarding the creation of many law enforcement units to tackle organized crime, but there is room for improvement as far as their effectiveness is concerned. The geography of Jordan\u2019s borders, with vast areas of desert, makes its territorial integrity difficult to maintain. Although the breakdown in security in Syria has increased the traffic of people and illegal goods crossing in and out of Jordan, the government appears to take the matter seriously and maintains reasonable success rates in thwarting cross-border smuggling, in large part due to a strong security service.","text - economic and financial environment":"The Jordanian government is the best performer in the region as far as anti-money laundering policy goes, and has strong and clear money-laundering regulations. The Know-Your-Customer programme collects data on financial customers and has proved effective at uncovering money laundering schemes. However, the evolving black market coming out of Syria has been an effective route for terrorist groups to launder their money as it remains outside the government\u2019s control. While the ease of doing business has improved over recent years in Jordan, it remains burdened with difficulties. Due to high taxes and low wages, many people choose to work in the informal market, which has now swelled to account for around a quarter of the economy, which in turn raises the pressure on firms working in the formal economy. Jordan has implemented strict measures on banking institutions, and its cooperation with international and national bodies to protect the economy has made it a safe investment environment where activities are kept free of any criminal activity.","text - civil society and social protection":"Jordan\u2019s victim and witness protection schemes are insufficiently enforced to be truly effective. The systems are under-resourced and victims of domestic servitude are too often arrested, imprisoned and deported for deeds perpetrated directly because of being trafficked. Nevertheless, the government does fund drug treatment centres and works alongside NGOs to provide shelters for victims of organized crime, to whom confidentiality is afforded when giving testimony. ##&& In terms of prevention, the Public Security Directorate created a programme that is widely deployed in Jordanian communities in cooperation with local councils to educate people and develop a sense of security and responsibility within communities. The authorities maintained prevention efforts, such as raising awareness about trafficking crimes by circulating anti-trafficking brochures and handing them to all migrant workers who are coming into the country. The authorities make major efforts to prevent forced marriages among the Syrian refugees, provide some education and administer work permits to Syrian refugees to regularize employment and protect them from labour exploitation. The government has pledged to conduct campaigns to arrest anyone carrying unlicensed firearms, and with regard to drugs, the anti-narcotics department runs public-awareness campaigns in collaboration with universities, schools and the media. ##&& The Jordanian government has reason to welcome civil society organizations, as it relies on financial support and assistance from them in various areas, including humanitarian assistance. Civil society organizations operate in many of the larger cities in Jordan alongside international development organizations focused on combating organized crime. However, Jordan\u2019s media environment is poor, and the government works hard to limit media freedom, with the media commission issuing gag orders and the government conducting close surveillance on many journalists. Many journalists are imprisoned under vague anti-terrorism laws, many websites are banned, and the highly contentious press and publications law was updated in 2012 to include news websites as well.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Amman","GDP (current $US million)":"44502.90","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"10101694","Land Area (sq. km)":"89320","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"76.8","Freedom in the World Index":"34","Human Development Index":"0.73","Global Peace Index":"1.96","Democracy Index":"3.62","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"49","GDP per capita (current US$)":"4405","1":"4.72","1.1":"4.55","1.2":"4.88","2":"5.92"},{"Corresp":"87","ISO-3":"KAZ","Country":"Kazakhstan","ISO-2":"KZ","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Central Asia and the Caucasus","Flag file":"kz.png","1.

Domestic victims are subject to sexual exploitation in Russia, the Middle East and Europe. Victims from other countries in Central Asia also transit Kazakhstan on their way to Russia and other European destination markets, while migrant workers from neighbouring countries in the region as well as Chinese, Filipinos and Ukrainians, are exploited in the Kazakh oil-focused economy, construction and domestic services. Exploitative labour practices have also been reported in the mining sector in Kazakhstan. Oralmans \u2013 ethnic Kazakhs who have returned to the country in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union \u2013 are most vulnerable to the practice. Although not as prevalent as in Uzbekistan, child labour also occurs in Kazakhstan. Female foreign nationals, as well as women from rural areas, are forced into prostitution in larger cities in Kazakhstan. Since an estimated 1 million Uzbek migrants were banned from re-entry into Russia, a significant percentage of them have tried settling in Kazakhstan, where they have become susceptible to trafficking. Trafficking rings reportedly collaborate with brothels in the country and abroad. Traffickers allegedly use debt bondage and tough national law enforcement policies as a means of coercing victims into remaining in exploitative situations. ##&& Irregular migration occurs within the region, primarily towards Kazakhstan and Russia. People with no valid travel documents, or citizens of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, seek help from smuggling networks. Kazakhstan may also be a transit country, with people from Southern Asia flying to Central Asia, from where they continue on land towards their final destinations in Europe. Irregular migrants may enter Central Asia in Tajikistan or Kyrgyzstan, from where they make their way through Kazakhstan and on to Russia, sometimes via Uzbekistan.","text - trade":"Historically, arms trafficking has been a concern for the Kazakh authorities and has often overlapped with illicit drug flows. Trafficking of weapons continues to be an issue, but while its extent is unknown, it is unlikely the impact of the market is significant. Information points to several routes for illicit weapons going into Kazakhstan, with authorities maintaining that Russia, Tajikistan and Afghanistan are the primary source countries. Other sources of illicit weapons include the diversion of domestic arms stockpiles and local craft production.","text - environment":"Illicit logging appears to be occurring in Kazakhstan, most likely on a small scale, while fauna crimes are more pronounced. Kazakhstan is a major partner in the Belt and Road Initiative, which will presumably increase the frequency of irregular wildlife trade along with legal trade. The poaching of sturgeon is a significant issue, with both live specimens and caviar being illegally trafficked. Indications point towards organized crime groups and state officials\u2019 involvement in the trade. Strict measures have been set in place and poaching is declining, but it is still problematic. Animals are predominantly poached for subsistence, but rare and threatened species (especially saiga antelope) have also been killed for their parts, which are subsequently smuggled into China and elsewhere in Eastern and South-eastern Asia. Trafficking has had a distinct environmental impact, evident in the striking 98% decline in the sturgeon population in the Ural-Caspian region in the span of a decade, and the 95% decline in the population of saiga antelope over the past 20 years. ##&& Additionally, fuel and lubricants have been illegally imported into Kyrgyzstan from Kazakhstan. Fuel is smuggled out of the country by Kazakhstani companies in collaboration with Kyrgyz nationals, mostly by rail. The Chaldybar\u2013Avtodorozhny and Kaindy\u2013Avtodorozhny checkpoints on the Kazakh-Kyrgyz border have been flagged as the main transit points for smuggled fuel, although historically Kazakhstani and Russian fuel was smuggled into Kyrgyzstan via the Chu (Shu) River.","text - drugs":"Kazakhstan is a key transit country on the so-called \u2018northern route\u2019 for heroin trafficking originating in Afghanistan and destined for Russia. The domestic heroin market in the country is well developed and among the largest in Central Asia. Conversely, the cocaine trade in the country is marginal, limited to the higher strata of the Kazakh society. ##&& Kazakhstan is a large producer of cannabis, which is cultivated predominantly in the Chu Valley. Official reports specify that more than 90% of the cannabis on the Russian market originates in Kazakhstan, while more than 80% of hashish either originates in or passes through Kazakhstan. Generally, seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants in Central Asia have been low compared to the more popular drugs across the region, namely cannabis and heroin. This suggests the existence of a smaller market for synthetic drugs in Kazakhstan. Nevertheless, the use of psychoactive substances is a relatively recent phenomenon and seems to be following the same pattern as in Russia, where younger users prefer synthetic drugs. The synthetic drug trade has not yet achieved a critical mass comparable with opiates, but it will likely grow in coming years. It is also likely that Kazakhstan plays some part in the global synthetic drug flows, serving as a waypoint for drug shipments trafficked from China onto Europe.","text - criminal actors":"Criminal networks in Kazakhstan may sometimes bribe low-ranking law enforcement officials to avoid charges. There are allegations of police officers facilitating human trafficking and being implicated in fauna crimes as well as the drug trade. While, in regard to systemic state collusion in organized crime, Kazakhstan cannot compare with other countries in Central Asia, corruption at the top level is pervasive with only regime loyalists being allowed access to state resources. Foreign actors are active in the country. According to some reports, Chinese Triads consider Kazakhstan a convenient transit point for synthetic drugs. Criminal communities based in Russia also exert a major influence on Kazakhstan. Foreign actors hailing from Central Asia and outside the region are known to engage in legal commercial activities in Kazakhstan as cover for trading in drugs. ##&& Mafia-style groups have been losing their foothold in Kazakhstan for the past couple of decades. The larger cities still have clusters of smaller, mafia-style organizations involved in drug trafficking. However, these do not usually control significant territories. Elements of former mafia structures that have survived are reportedly now a part of cross-border criminal organizations spanning the Kazakh-Russian border. Criminal networks in Kazakhstan are relatively underdeveloped compared with other countries in Central Asia. Only the smaller groups have remained in drug trafficking as it is considered to be too dangerous. Larger organizations have moved on to more lucrative smuggling markets, such as oil, alcohol and consumer goods brought in mainly from China. Most trafficking groups operate locally, but there are some that have ties to foreign groups and operate transnationally. They engage in human and drug trafficking, as well as in the smuggling of arms and counterfeit goods.","text - leadership and governance":"Prior to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev taking the reins in 2019, little official information was available on the country\u2019s approach to organized crime beyond the \u2018Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy\u2019 \u2013 which calls for increased attention to the underdeveloped border regions, modernization of the country\u2019s labour code and an intervention to stop sexual slavery. Since then, however, certain steps to strengthen the measures against the illicit economy have been taken, including the formation of an economic crimes agency. Corruption persists across the state apparatus. While it is true that law enforcement officers and the customs administration are vulnerable to corruption, the elite are not as intertwined with organized crime groups, in the sense that they do not facilitate organized crime activities. Kazakhstan is more of a kleptocratic state, and it is therefore unsurprising that corruption charges against members of the political elite are rare and only likely to be brought up in instances where individuals have fallen out of favour. Nevertheless, there are indications of the political elite controlling state resources and only allowing access to regime loyalists. Access to information in Kazakhstan is poor as both the legislature and the government offer little transparency over decision-making and other operations. ##&& Kazakhstan is party to all relevant treaties pertaining to organized crime and has bilateral extradition agreements with more than 60 nations. In spite of its international commitments, there is room for improvement in the field of international cooperation as trust in Kazakh authorities is, at times, limited. Nevertheless, the country\u2019s legislative framework is well equipped to tackle organized crime. Not only are the relevant laws in place, but amendments are drafted regularly \u2013 especially to human trafficking, wildlife crime and drug trafficking laws \u2013 in an attempt to better facilitate the response to current and emerging threats.","text - criminal justice and security":"Although Kazakhstan is able to enforce its laws, corruption is pervasive in the judicial system and the political elite hold influence over it. Recruitment in the judiciary is in the hands of high-level officials and court administrators. Expectations of justice and public trust in the efficiency of the legal system are therefore low. Recent changes to the country\u2019s legislative framework reportedly leave space for the potential and arbitrary prosecution of dissent. Prison guards have allegedly been involved in the abuse and torture of inmates, and the Kazakh penal system is struggling to meet international standards. Systemic lack of resources and corruption within the police is a significant issue as well, with arbitrary arrests and detentions a common occurrence. However, efforts to prosecute corrupt police officers have been met with impunity. In 2018, a roadmap for reforms in the police force was introduced, but these reforms are still ongoing. The national security committee of Kazakhstan (KNB) is the country\u2019s intelligence agency, which is tasked with counterterrorism as well as with managing the country\u2019s border services. The KNB also has specific units within its ranks that are tasked with countering forms of organized crime. Additionally, the ministry of interior has formed a special department within its ranks to counter organized crime and human trafficking. Due to its border and customs units being systematically underfunded and ill-trained, Kazakhstan struggles with securing its borders. The country\u2019s geographic location at the heart of cross-border trafficking flows makes it vulnerable to organized crime. Despite Kazakhstan receiving training and support from its international partners, further efforts in tackling drug trafficking, wildlife crime and human trafficking are necessary.","text - economic and financial environment":"Kazakhstan does not face any major vulnerabilities of money laundering and terrorist financing or strategic AML\/CFT deficiencies. In spite of that, as a transit country for a number of trafficking flows, and with its weak enforcement of AML\/CFT legislation, Kazakhstan is somewhat susceptible to money laundering. Despite government attempts to bring Kazakh legislation in line with international standards, law enforcement agencies lack the capacity to investigate sophisticated financial crimes. Additionally, parallel financial investigations are not carried out routinely alongside investigations of money laundering, and interagency information-sharing is poor. The economic regulatory environment in Kazakhstan is to some extent conducive to doing business and objectively better than most countries in the region. Another positive step is the adoption of unparalleled system-wide reforms that should improve the business environment in the country and lessen the bureaucratic barriers and burdens. Nevertheless, corruption is reportedly the primary constraint to doing business in Kazakhstan. Patronage networks negatively affect the country\u2019s business environment, while bureaucracy and vague legislation restrict foreign investment. In addition, public procurement carries a high risk of corruption for businesses investing in Kazakhstan, with public funds often diverted to individuals or companies with ties to the elite.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Kazakh government has taken steps to protect victims of human trafficking, but foreign victim identification and assistance are negligible. Related to that, large percentage of foreign victims are unwilling to self-identify primarily because they do not trust authorities. A number of state-funded, NGO-operated shelters for victims operate in the country, providing legal, medical and psychological assistance. Foreign victims, however, are ineligible to receive services at these shelters unless they cooperate with law enforcement. There is government assistance available to victims in the form of pro bono attorneys, but the latter often lack the experience. Victim referral and cooperation between NGOs and the police are reportedly effective. There is an anti-trafficking national action plan in place, which has provisions on prevention that are focused predominantly on raising awareness. Additionally, the government continues to promote the availability of an anti-trafficking hotline that is operated by an NGO. The latest available data on the prevention of drug use suggests that there are various government resolutions in place, in addition to regional programmes which also set out preventative measures. These include awareness-raising and health initiatives. ##&& Press freedom is heavily constrained. Most opposition media outlets have been banned and the few that remain are restricted by judicial proceedings. Mass surveillance and restriction of access characterize internet usage in Kazakhstan. Civil society organizations are underdeveloped and severely limited. Routine harassment and persecution of activists is the norm, while legislative amendments \u2013 often on the grounds of counteracting radicalization and extremism \u2013 have either already been adopted or are in the process of being drafted to tighten control over society. Foreign-funded NGOs are not allowed to pursue political goals, while restrictions on the freedom of association, assembly and speech make governmental control over the civil sector and political opponents ubiquitous.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Nursultan","GDP (current $US million)":"181665.91","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"18513673","Land Area (sq. km)":"2724902","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"61.2","Freedom in the World Index":"23","Human Development Index":"0.83","Global Peace Index":"1.95","Democracy Index":"3.14","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"38","GDP per capita (current US$)":"9813","1":"4.27","1.1":"4.15","1.2":"4.38","2":"4.71"},{"Corresp":"90","ISO-3":"PRK","Country":"Korea, DPR","ISO-2":"KP","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Eastern Asia","Flag file":"kp.png","1.

The country has two main human trafficking structures. The first is the trafficking of women and girls from the DPRK to China and adjacent countries by various criminal actors. These groups are likely to operate as fluid networks, with multiple brokers working together, including traffickers who seize young women and girls who have just crossed the border into China. The second human trafficking structure is perpetuated by government-mandated forced labour. Such forced labour happens at the domestic labour camps that form a central pillar of the DPRK\u2019s economic system. Since human trafficking is an important source of revenue and foreign currency for the DPRK government, the criminal market for human trafficking is extremely wide in scope. The number of North Koreans subjected to forced labour is estimated to be in the millions. ##&& Human smuggling out of the DPRK is primarily destined for China or the Republic of Korea. It is driven by human rights violations and poor conditions in the DPRK. Irregular migrants and refugees who have successfully made it out of the DPRK are very vulnerable to trafficking. For instance, they are often targeted and recruited in a method that accrues debt related to food and lodging, which subsequently subjects them to forced labour and prostitution, or they are targeted by Chinese traffickers as they cross the border and then sold into forced marriages, prostitution and other types of forced labour.","text - trade":"The DPRK is a source and destination country for arms trafficking. While there is no domestic illegal arms market in the traditional sense (most weapons in the country are purchased or built legally with a licence), State-sanctioned arms trafficking on a global scale is an important source of revenue for the government. Although no domestic groups are known to operate independently of the government, the DPRK has been known to collaborate with foreign mafia networks and violent extremist organizations. The DPRK specializes in exporting arms to terrorist organizations and governments that are subject to sanctions. These include the government of Syria, in addition to various militant organizations in Sudan, Libya and Yemen.","text - environment":"The government of the DPRK has established itself as an actor in global environmental crime markets in order to generate revenue and foreign currency. This state-sanctioned policy includes transnational smuggling and trade in rhino horn and ivory. These goods are often smuggled by DPRK diplomats under the cover of diplomatic immunity. There is also evidence of fuel and other commodities being smuggled into the DPRK in operations facilitated by Chinese, Japanese and Russian vessels and vehicles, as well as by domestic shopkeepers and business owners.","text - drugs":"The DPRK is a source country for synthetic drugs and cannabis, and the government is known to be involved in the production and supply of methamphetamine, as well as in the trafficking of heroin and cannabis. Methamphetamine is widely consumed and constitutes the largest illegal drug market in the DPRK. The government has been involved in setting up facilities for methamphetamine production, which when disbanded has resulted in workers and criminal networks setting up their own private laboratories for local consumers. The government of the DPRK is also known to have exported methamphetamine with the help of officials and diplomats in order to collect foreign currency. The drug is often used to relieve fatigue from working under harsh labour conditions, as well as to treat various health problems, given the scarcity of medicine in the country. ##&& Cannabis cultivation in the DPRK is widespread, but there is little information on consumption rates. Instead, there is evidence that at least some of the cannabis that is produced locally is exported by state actors to earn revenue. While DPRK officials have in the past been implicated in transnational heroin trafficking operations and relatively high rates of heroin use have been reported in past decades, heroin consumption is thought to be increasingly on the decline, largely as a result of the displacement effect caused by the increase in synthetic drug use.","text - criminal actors":"In the DPRK, the state exerts a high level of control over all criminal markets, and the government sustains criminal activities to generate foreign currency revenue in the face of heavy sanctions. Research suggests that transnational criminal activities, particularly money laundering but also various smuggling and trafficking operations, constitute an important source of revenue for the government. Embedded criminal actors can be found at all levels of the state apparatus, from top party cadres to local officials. ##&& However, while the state continues to be the chief perpetrator and patron of criminal activities, evidence suggests that the organized crime landscape in the DPRK is changing. For instance, the government\u2019s gradual withdrawal from narcotics production has created space for various non-state actors to enter the market, often in collaboration with local officials. Little reliable research has been published in regard to foreign criminal actors, although it is likely that there are a number of them who collaborate with the government. For example, Chinese actors are suspected of operating along the border in drug and human trafficking activities. There have also been cases of criminal groups from other countries in South-eastern Asia collaborating with the DPRK government. However, a peculiarity of the DPRK case is that foreign actors seeking to engage in illicit activity with the DPRK usually meet with representatives of the regime outside of the DPRK itself.","text - leadership and governance":"The DPRK is a totalitarian, one-party state characterized by a disregard for its citizens\u2019 human rights and political freedoms. The government is among the world\u2019s worst performers in terms of good governance and the fight against corruption. The DPRK exhibits many characteristics of a fragile state. The regime\u2019s stance against organized crime is opaque, and the state news agency, which is controlled by the Supreme Leader, has often denied the existence of organized crime in the country. At the same time, the state apparatus is actively engaged in organized crime, which makes it unlikely that it will show any leadership on the issue. Overall, all DPRK policies are designed to keep the Kim family in power, and as such, if their existence is threatened by emerging competitors, if businesspeople become too self-sufficient and powerful, draconian measures can be imposed immediately, against local black markets, for example. ##&& The DPRK has acceded to UNTOC and the three Palermo protocols but not UNCAC. The country does not engage much in international cooperation, which it generally tends to undermine rather than support. The only countries with which the DPRK has extradition treaties are China and, more recently, Russia. Domestically, the legal framework to counter organized crime is provided mainly by the DPRK\u2019s penal code and there is no evidence of any laws specifically targeting organized crime.","text - criminal justice and security":"The rule of law is extremely weak in the DPRK. Although a formal legal system exists, it is mired in corruption and is not capable of guaranteeing due process. Arbitrary arrests and unjustified detention are commonplace. Whether a crime has been committed or not, punishment may include torture in custody, execution or the deportation of individuals and families to forced labour camps. The DPRK is known to have some of the toughest and most inhumane prisons in the world, with the government maintaining extensive labour camps that contain tens to hundreds of thousands of forced labourers, both abroad and at home. The DPRK has two principal law enforcement agencies \u2013 the Ministry of People\u2019s Security, which includes divisions responsible for basic policing functions, and the Ministry for Protection of State Security \u2013 but neither of them has a specific mandate to combat organized crime. The DPRK is an extensive surveillance state with significant capacity to detect and deter illicit activities \u2013 but without the political will to address criminal policies and high-level state-embedded crime, its resilience to crime is very limited.","text - economic and financial environment":"The DPRK has one of the least-developed private sectors in the world, with free enterprise being close to impossible. Almost all property in the country belongs to the state, and with no functioning judiciary, weak rule of law and a non-functioning tax system, the economic environment is severely inhibited. The Workers\u2019 Party and the military control all companies earning foreign currency and hold a monopoly over most sectors. Moreover, the DPRK is subject to comprehensive sanctions. This limits its ability to trade and makes it virtually impossible to invest in the country without evading sanctions. ##&& The DPRK does not collaborate with the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF), neither is it a member of any of the regional FATF-style bodies, and nor does it comply with any FATF standards. The country has a long history of being involved in state-sanctioned counterfeiting, terrorist financing and deceptive financial practices. The DPRK is known to use Chinese and Russian banks to launder its revenues. It also uses other avenues, including procuring vessels flagged in foreign countries and accessing the global banking system through diplomatic means. Furthermore, the regime has done little (and in fact directly abets) the use of various cryptocurrencies by hackers based in the DPRK to launder illicit proceeds. The DPRK features prominently on every globally recognized blacklist for non-compliance with AML\/CFT standards.","text - civil society and social protection":"There is no evidence that the DPRK devotes any resources to the treatment or social protection of victims of organized crime, including the rehabilitation of people who wish to stop consuming drugs. Most international NGOs operating in the DPRK work in the humanitarian sector, but there are none that work on countering organized crime or supporting victims of organized crime. ##&& The DPRK is among the least-free countries in the world for independent media and civil society. There is no space for civil society organizations or journalists to address grievances or societal issues that are opposed to the interests of the ruling party. Information flows are strictly controlled, and penalties may be imposed on anyone who views, reads or listens to content provided by a media outlet outside the country.

Sex trafficking is the most prevalent form of human trafficking in the country, with victims tending to originate from South-east and Central Asian countries, and increasingly from Russia as well. Traffickers often lure women into sex work via contracts that involve hidden costs that indebt the victim. As with human trafficking, South Korea is predominantly a destination country for human smuggling flows. A significant number of North Koreans flee to South Korea every year, many of whom hire the services of organized networks of smugglers based in South Korea and China. In addition to refugees from North Korea, South Korea is also a destination country for migrants smuggled from various South Asian and South-east Asian countries.","text - trade":"The level of arms trafficking in South Korea is limited and the rate of confiscation by the police is very low. Authorities in the country have implemented voluntary firearm surrender schemes and weapon seizure programmes, which have contributed to the reduction of illicit firearms in the country.","text - environment":"South Korea is a destination country for illegally harvested timber and poached animals, as well as a transit country for illicit flows of fauna products and various non-renewable resources. As a major importer of timber and wood-based products, South Korea is believed to import a significant amount of illegally harvested timber. At the same time, however, illegal imports have fallen over the years, which may also reflect the fact of the reduction in illegal logging in Indonesia, a key trading partner in timber. South Korea has long been a destination for illegal wildlife trade, including rhino horns, for use in traditional medicine. Additionally, South Korea is one of the known transit points for illicit wildlife products such as ivory, rhino horn and pangolin scales being smuggled from Africa to China. However, while illegal wildlife trade persists in South Korea, stricter regulations and reforms have reduced the size of the criminal market significantly. Some non-renewable resources, such as illegally mined gold and North Korean coal, are also believed to transit South Korean territory.","text - drugs":"South Korea is neither a major consumer nor producer of heroin, cocaine or cannabis, but evidence suggests that the use of synthetic drugs has steadily increased in recent years. Methamphetamine, known as \u2018ice\u2019 or \u2018philopon\u2019, is believed to be the largest drug market in South Korea, with record-breaking seizures of the drug having been made in recent years. In addition to methamphetamine (which is also mixed with caffeine in \u2018yaba\u2019 pills), the use of ecstasy and the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 has also steadily increased. Korean drug dealers import synthetic drugs via foreign drug trafficking organizations, including the Taiwanese syndicate Zhulianbang (the Bamboo Union Gang) and the Japanese Inagawa-kai. In recent years, methamphetamine trafficked from South-eastern Asia and Taiwan has increased, while crystalline methamphetamine trafficked from China has decreased significantly. As in many other countries, marketplaces for synthetic drugs are increasingly found online. ##&& Despite being the first East Asian country to legalize medical cannabis, South Korea has some of the strictest rules regarding the sale and consumption of recreational cannabis. Because of this, the country has a relatively small cannabis market by global standards. Nevertheless, attempts to smuggle liquid cannabis and cannabis-infused foods have increased in recent years. South Korea is mainly a transit country for cocaine travelling to other destinations including Australia, China, Hong Kong, Macau and other parts of Asia. Most known cases of cocaine smuggling via South Korea have involved criminal networks and drug trafficking cartels, predominantly from Columbia and Mexico. Heroin is not commonly used in Korea, as indicated by seizure and arrest data, but there have been large seizures of poppy plants.","text - criminal actors":"Criminal actors in South Korea are mostly domestic and foreign mafia-style actors and decentralized criminal networks. South Korean mafia-style criminal actors include the Cheongha Wisaeng-pa, the country\u2019s largest crime syndicate, as well as the Chilseong-pa, the Tongsongno-pa and the Shinsangsa-pa. These mafia-style groups have a strong hierarchal structure, comprising a boss (\u2018tumok\u2019) and an underboss boss (\u2018pu-tumok\u2019) who are in charge of the day-to-day operations which in turn are implemented by captains (\u2018haengdong daechang\u2019). South Korean crime syndicates also have at their service several advisors (\u2018ko-mun\u2019), who are often either members of the political or business elite, illustrating the power and reach of the criminal organizations. Entertainment businesses, drug smuggling, extortion, real estate and the sex trade are dominated by mafia-style groups, while extortion remains an important means for organized crime groups to generate revenue. ##&& In addition to mafia-style actors of domestic origin, several foreign mafia-style actors are operating in South Korea. These include Chinese Triads, Japanese Yakuza and the Russian mafia. These foreign criminal actors have substantial influence in the criminal markets for drugs and increasingly in sex trafficking and human smuggling as well. Criminal networks are prevalent in many of the same criminal markets as mafia-style actors, namely drug trafficking (mainly methamphetamine), sex trafficking and loan sharking. Although there is limited evidence of sustained engagement of state-embedded actors in illicit activities, criminal actors have been known to form links to corrupt elements of the state. These include politicians, decision-makers and police officers who can provide some level of protection.","text - leadership and governance":"South Korea is a stable and consolidated democracy with a strong record of respecting political freedoms and human rights. The government of South Korea has shown commitment and leadership in the fight against transnational organized crime and has relatively strong capabilities for combating crime. Corruption at high levels of the public and private sectors remains an issue and improving government transparency is a work in progress. However, the government has shown a commitment to address corruption and has made great progress in strengthening the county\u2019s integrity systems. ##&& The government has also shown commitment to international cooperation in the fight against organized crime. South Korea has ratified UNTOC, the Palermo protocols, UNCAC and other key treaties. South Korean authorities engage in international cooperation through organizations such as the UNODC and INTERPOL. The government has signed extradition treaties and mutual legal assistance treaties with around a dozen countries and supports a number of regional initiatives against transnational crime. Domestically, South Korea\u2019s legal framework for combating organized crime contains the necessary provisions for an effective response against criminal markets in drugs, human trafficking and other crimes such as money laundering. The legal framework also criminalizes forming or participating in criminal organizations, though these provisions are not always easy to apply in practice.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judiciary in South Korean courts is considered independent, reliable and efficient in handling cases. However, in recent years, a number of corruption scandals have damaged the integrity of the courts. Detention facilities are generally up to global standards and there are no reports of severe abuse such as torture or overcrowded prisons with unsanitary conditions. While police officers have been known to abuse their power in some cases, law enforcement in South Korea is generally a source of resilience. The Korean national police agency has specialized units capable of tackling a wide range of threats and crimes and has very high clearance rates for serious crimes. One source of vulnerability in regard to the territorial integrity of the country, however, is South Korea\u2019s northern neighbour, which is a source of many illicit and criminal flows and whose government generally has a destabilizing effect on the region.","text - economic and financial environment":"South Korea has a dynamic, export-oriented economy with an economic regulatory framework that is very comprehensive and conducive for private sector development and foreign direct investment. Organized criminal actors in South Korea are increasingly diversifying their activities into legal activities such as construction, real estate, gambling and stock trading, but there is no evidence that involvement of organized criminals in legal sectors limits the opportunities for non-criminals. South Korea\u2019s legal and institutional framework for AML\/CFT is relatively efficient and the country is not currently considered a major jurisdiction for money laundering. While South Korea does not have any major strategic deficiencies in its AML\/CFT framework, there is room for improvement as the country is only partially compliant on eight of the 40 Financial Action Task Force recommendations. Cash dealing and cryptocurrencies are the most vulnerable to money laundering in South Korea, although there is a relatively low risk of financing terrorism.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government of South Korea has set up a number of victim protection mechanisms and has created laws intending to regulate a national victim protection regime. While there is no formal witness protection programme, the law orders the central government to assume responsibility for the protection of crime reporters and whistle-blowers. Moreover, South Korea has set up a mechanism for legal counselling, advice and representation for those without financial resources and legal knowledge. Victims of sexual abuse can seek a range of medical, legal and psychosocial services in larger cities. In regard to preventive measures, the government of South Korea has been actively participating in regional efforts to prevent trafficking in people. The government has also established a task force that focuses on prevention of prostitution and has been taking measures to improve recruiting and employment transparency in order to prevent the possibility of smuggling, forced labour, debt bondage and other forms of modern slavery. Moreover, the Korean Institute of Criminology conducts policy-relevant research on crime prevention and the treatment of offenders to inform effective crime prevention strategies. ##&& Human rights groups and other NGOs are active and generally operate freely within South Korea, although these organizations have at times faced political pressure when they criticized the government or other powerful groups. The media are for the most part free to report critically on government policies and allegations of wrongdoing on the part of business and political elites alike. However, political interference is not uncommon and strict defamation laws have led to a certain degree of self-censorship.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Seoul","GDP (current $US million)":"1646739.22","Income group":"High income","Population":"51709098","Land Area (sq. km)":"100370","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"32.5","Freedom in the World Index":"83","Human Development Index":"0.92","Global Peace Index":"1.83","Democracy Index":"8.01","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"61","GDP per capita (current US$)":"31846","1":"4.92","1.1":"3.95","1.2":"5.88","2":"7.54"},{"Corresp":"92","ISO-3":"KWT","Country":"Kuwait","ISO-2":"KW","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Western Asia","Flag file":"kw.png","1.

For the most part, migrants travel willingly to Kuwait from elsewhere in the Middle East, Southern Asia and Africa to seek legitimate employment, but become vulnerable to human trafficking perpetrated by recruitment agencies. Irregular migrants also work informally in Kuwait, where they may face practices that amount to modern slavery. Corruption is rampant as state officials accept bribes and sell work permits to illegal-labour recruitment agencies and migrant workers. Thus, migrant workers are vulnerable to being sold in online 'slave markets' via social media and other online apps. The Kafala (sponsorship) system in Kuwait further endangers migrant workers by binding them to their employers as sponsors, increasing the likelihood of abusive work relationships. ##&& Kuwait relies heavily on imported labour, which promotes a large human smuggling market. The Kafala system creates market opportunities for higher levels of irregular and exploitative migration by reducing entry barriers and increasing incentives for imported labour. Foreign workers are smuggled into Kuwait mainly through the country\u2019s al-Abdali border crossing, where instability in neighbouring Iraq has created a vulnerability. Migrant workers predominantly come from Southern Asia, South-eastern Asia, Africa and elsewhere in the Middle East, relying on recruitment agencies to procure legal documents, but often become victims of fraud. If migrant workers are unable to obtain work permits, they opt to be covertly smuggled into the country.","text - trade":"The number of small and light arms in Kuwait has grown to pose a large threat to security. Cases of attempted arms trafficking into the country have been recorded, but information on the scope and scale is scarce. Kuwaiti contract rifles have appeared in Iraq, on the local arms market in Iraqi Kurdistan; however, it is unknown whether these were captured weapons from the 1991 Gulf War or diverted surplus. Reports from early 2020 have alleged that Kuwait was one of the host countries for companies laundering proceeds related to the North Korean nuclear programme of North Korea.","text - environment":"Allegedly, an illicit market for agarwood exists in Kuwait, although its dynamics are unknown. The UAE is an important part of the illicit agarwood trade, importing, consuming and re-exporting agarwood, with Kuwait being among its primary end destinations. Data also shows that Kuwait appears to be a re-exporter as well. The fauna crimes market in Kuwait primarily revolves around the illicit trade of live rare species to be kept as pets, but the dynamics of the market are uncharted. Scarce information points to the presence of dealers offering endangered species such as cheetahs, tigers, birds, reptiles and great apes online. Evidence suggests that falcons and eagles are smuggled into Kuwait from Iraq at al-Abdali, while parrots have been smuggled from Cameroon. Reports also indicate that orangutans, gibbons and clouded leopards have been sold in pet shops in the country. Even though Kuwait has one of the largest oil reserves in the world, the boost in oil-derivative prices in neighbouring countries has increased the smuggling of oil derivatives into Kuwait. Smuggling occurs through seaports and across land borders. The ruling family and Kuwaiti elite, on the other hand, control the domestic oil-derivatives sector. Purportedly, the subsidized oil and diesel budget is subject to organized theft by state-embedded actors. Multiple reports indicate the existence of gold smuggling out of Kuwait to Bangladesh and India, but this appears to be small in scale.","text - drugs":"The presence of heroin and cocaine is fairly low in Kuwait, but a domestic market exists nonetheless. Official reports indicate that the al-Abdali border crossing with Iraq is the primary entry point for both drugs into Kuwait, but cocaine has also been smuggled into the country by post. The exact dynamics of the heroin and cocaine markets are unknown, but evidence suggest that taxi drivers are involved in the distribution of drugs in general in the country. ##&& Studies suggest that Spice, a type of synthetic cannabis, is the most prevalent drug in Kuwait; however, other synthetic drugs, such as methamphetamine and Captagon, are also used. Cannabis is the second most popular drug in Kuwait and, like heroin and cocaine, is mostly brought into the country through al-Abdali from Iraq. Cannabis traffickers, reportedly both domestic and foreign actors, have used maritime borders to smuggle the drug, while synthetic drugs are known to be smuggled via air cargo as well.","text - criminal actors":"State-embedded actors seem to be the most prolific criminal category in Kuwait. High-level state officials are involved in the organized theft of public funds, related to state control over the lucrative oil and gas sector. Additionally, in terms of bribery, facilitation payments and gifts are widespread and occur with impunity, and state-embedded actors also aid the illicit activities of criminal networks. The latter for the most part engage in human smuggling and trafficking as well as drug trafficking, taking advantage of their ties to state-embedded actors to avoid investigations, escape prosecution or obtain fraudulent documents. Recruitment agencies dominate the market for the smuggling and trafficking of human beings. Criminal networks also organize online 'slave markets' where they post listings of human beings for sale. Moreover, criminal networks engage in smuggling drugs into Kuwait, which has been exacerbated by Iraqi instability and a lack of control along the Kuwait\u2013Iraq border. ##&& Foreign actors participate in various criminal activities in Kuwait, mostly in the smuggling and trafficking of human beings as well as in drug trafficking. However, foreign actors are probably less influential than domestic criminal networks and state-embedded actors. There is no evidence to suggest that mafia-style groups exist in Kuwait.","text - leadership and governance":"Both its geographical positioning and its high dependence on foreign labour make Kuwait attractive for organized crime operations. As drug trafficking and human smuggling and trafficking are the most prominent markets in Kuwait, they tend to feature more strongly in the government's anti-organized crime agenda. The Arab Spring uprisings have increased political pressure on Kuwait, especially with respect to a lack of transparency as well as social and political freedoms. In spite of anti-corruption strategies aimed at fostering transparency, good governance and integrity, anti-corruption laws are not effectively enforced in the country. There is an anti-corruption body \u2013 the Kuwait Anti-Corruption Authority (Nazaha) \u2013 but its efficiency is questionable, as corruption is rampant in Kuwait. Transparency is also an issue, as the country lacks legislation that guarantees the right to access public information and specific mechanisms to encourage the disclosure of information on governmental operations. Furthermore, there is a law prohibiting disclosure of information as well as statistical data regarding the Kuwait Investment Authority, or the transactions, assets and investments of the natural resources funds authority. This illustrates the entrenched opaqueness of Kuwaiti governmental apparatus. ##&& Kuwait is party to several international treaties pertaining to organized crime, which arguably provide sufficient grounds for the country to implement effective anti-organized crime measures. Kuwait\u2019s central role in the Gulf Cooperation Council and its strong relationship with the US are also central components of its international cooperation efforts. In addition, the UNODC and INTERPOL support Kuwaiti anti-organized crime initiatives, while UNDP works with Nazaha in promoting anti-corruption. Kuwait has extradition treaties with several countries, but a number of African states have bans preventing their nationals from being recruited as domestic workers in Kuwait, due to increased vulnerability to exploitation. While Kuwaiti legislation criminalizes human smuggling and trafficking as well as other offences of interest to this Index, many laws remain unenforced. Weak labour protections deny workers safeguards against exploitative practices, and sponsorship laws tie migrant workers\u2019 legal residence and valid immigration status to employers, which limits their movement and punishes workers for fleeing abusive workplaces. Corruption also hinders the implementation of laws, with officials selling work permits to illegal recruitment agencies and taking bribes to enable offenders to avoid investigation or escape prosecution.","text - criminal justice and security":"Executive pressure renders the criminal justice system unsuccessful in guaranteeing fair trial and due process rights, despite the judiciary being independent on paper. Prosecutions of organized crime cases also remain low, and convictions even lower, while both judges and prosecutors may at times be erratic in their conduct and decision making. Abuse of office, active and passive bribery as well as receiving gifts are all issues underpinning the Kuwaiti judicial system. There are several units responsible for tackling organized crime, but focus tends to be put on human trafficking and smuggling. Nevertheless, international organizations maintain that there are some structural issues with Kuwaiti anti-organized crime units. Coordination between authorities, service providers and NGOs with respect to countering organized crime is also not yet at the required level. Not least, corruption is reported to permeate law enforcement as well. Against this backdrop, Kuwait remains vulnerable to organized criminal activity, due to ongoing regional conflict, particularly in Iraq. ISIS's control over large parts of Iraq meant that Kuwait used to face significant challenges in securing its northern border, but the threat seems to have subsided. Nonetheless, traffickers find new and innovative ways to smuggle illicit goods into the country, which requires adaptation on the part of national law enforcement agencies.","text - economic and financial environment":"Kuwait allegedly provides a suitable environment for money laundering, with fraud, corruption and smuggling all generating proceeds needing to be laundered in the country. Recently, authorities stepped up anti-money laundering efforts, which are evident in the better identification of money laundering activities. This increased awareness of the threat of money laundering and the implementation of adequate anti-money laundering legislation is, however, somewhat weakened by the absence of substantive efforts in tackling elite corruption. On the other hand, the business environment in Kuwait has improved since 2018 because of the implementation of measures to strengthen and improve the economic regulatory framework. Additionally, the Kuwaiti government has announced plans to help the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic through significant stimulus measures.","text - civil society and social protection":"There are government-operated shelters in Kuwait for female human trafficking victims, providing medical, psychological and legal services, as along with repatriation assistance. However, even while residing in these shelters, victims are at risk of deportation and detention, based on charges of irregular migration filed by exploitative employers. There are no shelters for men, leaving male workers subject to exploitation with no assistance and protection. Refugees, asylum seekers and stateless people are also made vulnerable to trafficking due to the absence of adequate legal and policy frameworks to protect them. Despite the long-standing risk of victimization, prevention efforts are underdeveloped. Awareness-raising campaigns feature strongly on the government\u2019s agenda, but the public and employers of domestic workers alike remain unaware that human trafficking is an issue. A national strategy to combat trafficking was approved in 2018, but efforts were limited to the production and distribution of anti-trafficking brochures to vulnerable people as well as awareness raising through media campaigns. A national strategy to combat drug use has been implemented along with the UNDP and the UNODC, but, as with trafficking, it is limited to awareness raising. The country has suffered from a deteriorating media environment in recent years, with government controlling all publications and distribution of information, along with companies providing internet, mobile, cable and satellite services. Strict censorship laws threaten journalists with arrest, while freedom of assembly and of association are limited, despite being guaranteed by law. Civil society is also monitored by the authorities, and the registration and licensing of NGOs is restricted. NGOs cannot engage in political matters, but unlicensed and unofficial organizations have become more active following the Arab Spring.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Kuwait","GDP (current $US million)":"134628.54","Income group":"High income","Population":"4207083","Land Area (sq. km)":"17820","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"52.9","Freedom in the World Index":"37","Human Development Index":"0.81","Global Peace Index":"1.72","Democracy Index":"3.80","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"42","GDP per capita (current US$)":"32000","1":"5.14","1.1":"6.15","1.2":"4.13","2":"5.54"},{"Corresp":"93","ISO-3":"KGZ","Country":"Kyrgyzstan","ISO-2":"KG","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Central Asia and the Caucasus","Flag file":"kg.png","1.

Women, men and children are all victimized, being forced into labour domestically or abroad, in neighbouring countries or elsewhere in Central Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Male labour migrants, however, appear to be most vulnerable to exploitation. Forced labour primarily occurs in the agricultural, construction and textile industries, although victims have also been forced into domestic servitude and childcare. Forced labour victims also face extortion and have their passports stolen. Children in Kyrgyzstan have been forced to participate in the drug trade, both locally and in neighbouring countries, as well as to engage in domestic servitude and begging. Kyrgyz women and girls experience sex trafficking both domestically and throughout the Middle East and Asia. Kyrgyz nationals have also been forced to participate in extremist fighting groups and subjected to sexual exploitation in Syria. Uzbek women and girls are sexually exploited in southern Kyrgyzstan, and migrants from across Central Asia who transit through the country have also fallen vulnerable to exploitation. Corrupt government officials facilitate Kyrgyzstan\u2019s human-trafficking market, enabling traffickers to operate with relative impunity. ##&& Although Kyrgyzstan\u2019s human-smuggling market flourishes alongside the human-trafficking market, it can be difficult to distinguish the two markets, as many smuggled migrants subsequently fall victim to exploitation. Corrupt Kyrgyz officials facilitate human smuggling through the sale of fraudulent migration documents and identity cards. Most migrants smuggled out of Kyrgyzstan seek transportation to Russia or Turkey in search of better economic opportunities. However, smuggled migrants from Southern Asia and South-eastern Asia seeking transportation to Russia or Europe also transit through Kyrgyzstan. Although Kyrgyz citizens may travel freely between Kazakhstan and Russia for the purpose of labour, many migrants employ smugglers to protect against exploitation.","text - trade":"Kyrgyzstan\u2019s arms-trafficking market is negligible. Nevertheless, registration loopholes and a lack of government oversight enable civilians to obtain multiple firearms, and many civilians own unregistered arms. Aside from an ammunition plant in Bishkek, there are no arms-production centres in Kyrgyzstan, suggesting the presence of an illicit arms trade. However, Kyrgyzstan is primarily a transit country for arms trafficked from elsewhere in Central Asia to other regions. An increase in civilian demand for arms in recent years may be attributed to the legalisation of the use of hunting weapons for protection. Arms trafficking in Kyrgyzstan is primarily controlled by foreign rather than local criminals. Due to civil unrest, a limited amount of state arms has been looted in recent years.","text - environment":"As a biodiversity hotspot, Kyrgyzstan also has a high number of rare and protected flora and fauna species, which has been threatened by livestock grazing, firewood collection, construction and tree felling. Poor flora and fauna management enable criminal activity to occur, although the flora-crimes market remains rather limited, exhibiting limited evidence of involvement of organized crime groups. Poaching, however, is a more pronounced issue and many protected species are illegally traded or kept as trophies. Argali, brown bear and wolf species have been targeted and trafficked out of Kyrgyzstan to other countries in Central Asia. Saker falcons are also illicitly traded both domestically and elsewhere in Central Asia. Kyrgyzstan is a top destination for trophy hunting, threatening species such as the Marco Polo sheep. Since the illicit fauna trade generates some revenue, no effort has been taken to hinder the market. Instead, the rejection of legislation to protect endangered species has only emboldened criminals. However, the market is largely controlled by foreign actors. ##&& Kyrgyzstan\u2019s non-renewable-resource crimes market is also flourishing. The country has several large rare-metal deposits, including gold deposits, and is rich in other mineral resources such as coal, uranium and antimony. Illicit coal- and gold-mining is widespread in southern Kyrgyzstan, and both domestic and foreign criminals engage in the market.","text - drugs":"Drug trafficking in Kyrgyzstan is controlled by foreign actors from transnational organized-crime groups.

Nearly one-fourth of Afghan heroin transits through Kyrgyzstan. Heroin from neighbouring countries and elsewhere in Central Asia is also trafficked through Bishkek by transnational organized-crime groups, and links between heroin trafficking in Kyrgyzstan and terrorist groups such as the Taliban have been uncovered. Police and political corruption also exacerbate heroin trafficking, as drug profits play a key role in elections. Notably, police officers and border guards on the southern Kyrgyz border have been implicated in the trafficking of heroin. However, heroin seizures have declined in recent years. Local cannabis cultivation also occurs in Kyrgyzstan, and cannabis has been trafficked abroad. While hashish and marijuana seizures have dropped in recent years, cannabis seizures are on the rise, likely due to increasing demand for cannabis in neighbouring countries. Internal cannabis trafficking occurs as well. Kyrgyzstan\u2019s southern borders are particularly vulnerable to hashish trafficking between Central Asia and Russia, Europe and North America. ##&& The synthetic-drug trade, although expanding, is still relatively small. While domestic consumption remains low, psychotropic substances intended for sale among Kyrgyz youth have been seized. Some reports suggest that locally produced amphetamines, club drugs, hallucinogens and synthetic cannabinoids are also trafficked through Kyrgyzstan. Although ecstasy is the most common amphetamine consumed in Central Asia, amphetamine use in Kyrgyzstan remains lower than that of opioids, cannabis and hallucinogens, among other. The cocaine trade is much smaller than other drug markets in Kyrgyzstan, mostly limited to use among the wealthy. It is likely that small quantities of cocaine are smuggled in the country from Russia. ","text - criminal actors":"Organized crime in Kyrgyzstan is dominated by local criminal groups that operate in specific criminal markets. However, regional criminal activity is on the rise and large organized-crime groups also operate in the country. Four well-known mafia-style groups are led by Kamchy Kolbayev, Aziz Batukayev, Almaz Bokushev and Maksat Abakirov. Although the influence of these groups has decreased in recent years, mafia-style groups continue to exert influence on local populations and prisons and operate in multiple criminal markets. Numerous loose criminal networks and dozens of criminal gangs also operate in Kyrgyzstan, engaging primarily in illicit goods smuggling. Gangs in southern Kyrgyzstan tend to specialize in drug trafficking, while those in Bishkek and elsewhere in northern Kyrgyzstan tend to engage in racketeering, the embezzlement of state assets and the illicit smuggling of Chinese goods. Mafia-style groups and criminal networks alike influence the democratic process in Kyrgyzstan. ##&& Criminal networks are intricately intertwined with the Kyrgyz state apparatus. Organized-crime bosses have strong connections to state-embedded actors and are actively protected by politicians. State-embedded actors thus facilitate and sometimes engage in criminal markets, especially in the drug trade. There is evidence of state control over illicit activities at all levels of the state apparatus. Corrupt police also facilitate organized crimes such as human trafficking. Local criminal networks engage extensively with foreign counterparts, especially in the human-trafficking, drug-trafficking and non-renewable resources crimes markets. Some local criminal groups also organize on the basis of foreign ethnicity, including Uzbek, Tajik, Azeri, Chechen and Russian gangs. The drug trade in particular is controlled by foreign criminal actors.","text - leadership and governance":"The Kyrgyz government has taken a strong stance against some forms of organized crime, such as human trafficking and human smuggling. Since the 2010 regime change, the government has consistently requested international aid in order to combat corruption and restore the country\u2019s rule of law and has launched a major campaign against organized crime. The National Security Committee is thus responsible for combating organized crime and corruption. However, corruption and bribery run rampant in Kyrgyzstan, and public trust in governance is low. Organized crime remains largely undeterred and anti-organized-crime and anti-corruption efforts are hindered by ongoing political competition and corruption, especially in border and customs agencies. The Kyrgyz government is thus highly vulnerable to criminal influence and the political system has been largely infiltrated by organized crime, evidenced in the election of criminals to government positions. Anti-corruption efforts remain ineffective and also lack political independence, as the fight against corruption tends to only target disloyal figures. Kyrgyzstan is thus a highly vulnerable and fragile state. ##&& Kyrgyzstan suffers from the government\u2019s failure to preserve checks and balances, as well as a lack of protection for democracy. Laws pertaining to rights and access to information are relatively robust, however. Kyrgyzstan has also ratified most relevant conventions and treaties related to organized crime, with the exception of the Arms Trade Treaty, and has several extradition treaties in place. The Kyrgyz government also participates in international cooperation efforts against various forms of organized crime and has put forth significant effort to combat environmental crimes. However, response to other criminal markets is lacking. Although Kyrgyzstan\u2019s legislative framework addresses various forms of organized crime, such as drug trafficking and human trafficking, laws are rather ineffective and implementation is to be enhanced.","text - criminal justice and security":"Kyrgyzstan\u2019s judiciary lacks political independence and is extremely corrupt. There are no units dedicated to organized crime, and corruption and bribery run rampant among judges. Judges also pay bribes to obtain their positions. The right to fair trial is severely compromised, and coerced confessions through torture along with other practices, such as the negation to an attorney and arbitrary convictions, are commonplace. Intimidation, threats and violence against defendants, attorneys and judges are not unusual. The judiciary is also heavily influenced by organized crime and corrupt politicians, in turn preventing convictions of organized criminals. Prison conditions are poor. Prisoners suffer from food and medicine shortages, overcrowding and other forms of mistreatment. Organized-crime groups wield significant control over prisons. The Kyrgyz law-enforcement apparatus is also highly corrupt and many police officers accept bribes and have links to organized crime. Public trust in the police is therefore extremely low. Law-enforcement officials are also unlikely to enforce drug or other policies that threaten the illicit incomes of corrupt government officials. Nepotism, political influence and lack of professionalism limit law-enforcement capacity, especially in southern Kyrgyzstan. Police officers reportedly engage in arbitrary arrests and threaten prosecution as a means of extortion. However, community-based policing systems have aided in increasing public trust in police through enhancing cooperation between police, local government, civil society and the media. ##&& Due to its alpine topography and rough landscape, Kyrgyzstan\u2019s borders are quite challenging to monitor, rendering the country more vulnerable to organized crime. A lack of infrastructure also prevents the use of vehicles in border regions, making the country\u2019s borders highly porous, especially in southern Kyrgyzstan where high rates of organized crime occur. The Kyrgyz\u2013Uzbek and Kyrgyz\u2013Tajik borders, in particular, are difficult to monitor due to widespread criminality and the eruption of long-standing ethnic tensions in borderlands. Border-control personnel are also poorly funded and under-resourced, making corruption an even more pressing issue. The country\u2019s major trading locations are at least partially controlled by criminal actors. ","text - economic and financial environment":"Kyrgyzstan has an extremely high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing, which is exacerbated by the country\u2019s proximity to terrorist groups in neighbouring countries and its positioning along major drug-trafficking routes. The country\u2019s shadow economy is also largely cash-based, making it more difficult for authorities to identify instances of money laundering and tax evasion. Despite the existence of anti-money-laundering legislation, no explicit anti-money-laundering strategy is in place, rendering the legislation ineffective. Kyrgyz financial institutions lack knowledge about money-laundering and terrorist-financing risks. ##&& Corruption also runs rampant in the business sector, impeding entrepreneurship in Kyrgyzstan. The economic environment does not offer many opportunities for legitimate businesses to expand. Although there are few official procedures for setting up a business in Kyrgyzstan, they are complicated by burdensome bureaucracy and bribery. The economic regulatory system also lacks transparency, in turn deterring foreign investors. Many businesses have reported paying bribes to obtain operating licenses. Nevertheless, the reliability of power supply, access to credit information and ease of paying taxes have improved in recent years. ","text - civil society and social protection":"Kyrgyzstan lacks sufficient victim-protection and treatment services. Although the government launched a three-year national action plan between 2017 and 2020 aimed at improving victim-identification mechanisms, Kyrgyzstan fails to meet international standards for victim identification and protection. Although police have referred victims to NGOs for assistance, this is a rare occurrence. Instead, police tend to intimidate and coerce human-trafficking victims, including minors, and ask for payments from traffickers to drop charges. Moreover, trafficking victims have been pressured to withdraw their complaints or settle cases informally. Victims are also deterred from cooperating with police, as they are required to attend public hearings alongside their traffickers. However, the government promotes drug harm-reduction programmes, victim-support measures and drug-awareness campaigns aimed at youth, albeit heavily supported by international funding and partnerships. Although witness-protection laws are in place and have recently been expanded, implementation remains weak. ##&& Crime prevention in Kyrgyzstan is inefficient. However, the government and civil society have organized human-trafficking awareness training for professionals working with children. The government also provides awareness-raising activities to children and engages in the prevention of flora and fauna crimes. Overall, Kyrgyzstan\u2019s approach to crime prevention revolves around awareness-raising campaigns and training about the legal consequences of crime, especially for at-risk communities. Kyrgyz civil society largely fails to aid in victim-protection and treatment programmes, which are instead primarily led by international organisations or the Kyrgyz government. However, Kyrgyz civil society actively collaborates with the government on other issues. Civil society organizations are thus active and effective, although they tend to focus on issues related to human and civil rights, as well as consumer interests, rather than organized crime. Numerous NGOs also work to combat high-level corruption and engage in legislative reform campaigns. However, civil society is largely hindered by inter-ethnic conflict and legal restrictions on freedoms of assembly and association. Although freedom of speech and the press are provided by law, these rights are severely restricted in practice and self-censorship due to political pressure is common. Some journalists have been subjected to intimidation and harassment by political figures. Kyrgyzstan\u2019s media also lacks diversity and both Uzbek- and Russian-language media outlets are limited.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Bishkek","GDP (current $US million)":"8454.62","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"6456200","Land Area (sq. km)":"199950","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"76.4","Freedom in the World Index":"28","Human Development Index":"0.7","Global Peace Index":"2.09","Democracy Index":"4.21","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"31","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1310","1":"5.33","1.1":"4.40","1.2":"6.25","2":"4.17"},{"Corresp":"94","ISO-3":"LAO","Country":"Laos","ISO-2":"LA","Continent":"Asia","Region":"South-Eastern Asia","Flag file":"la.png","1.

Men and boys from Laos and neighbouring countries are vulnerable to forced labour in the fishing, construction and agricultural sector in Thailand. However, internal trafficking of both Lao and foreign nationals is also pervasive, driven in large part by a combination of irregular labour migration, lack of economic opportunities and rising rates of poverty. Internally, young women and girls from Laos and neighbouring countries are vulnerable to forced labour, particularly in the illicit logging and construction sectors, as well as to sexual exploitation, the demand for which is often fuelled by external sources such as tourists and businesspeople. Traffickers often recruit through personal connections. Additionally, foreign-owned companies and corrupt officials also facilitate the market. ##&& Human smuggling in Laos largely involves the movement of employment-seeking individuals from across South-eastern Asia and other developing countries in Asia through Laos into Thailand. Corruption among law-enforcement, military and immigration officials plays a key role in supporting the market.","text - trade":"Laos is a transit country for arms trafficking into Myanmar, in particular to Wa State, where active insurgent groups operate. The weapons trafficked through the country are believed to originate primarily from China, with considerable state involvement playing an important role in the illicit trade. Although civilian arms-possession is banned in the country, some individuals in rural areas do own guns, mainly for traditional hunting purposes.","text - environment":"Illicit logging is one of Laos\u2019 most significant and profitable criminal markets, featuring significant involvement of highly organized and transnational criminal groups. The market is largely driven by high demand for protected wood, such as Siamese rosewood, in Vietnam and China. Illicit logging has had a severe impact on the country\u2019s ecosystem, including the destruction of entire forest areas in the provinces of Saravan and Sekong. ##&& Laos also has one of the world\u2019s most notable illegal wildlife trade markets, serving as a major transit point for wildlife trafficking, in particular of ivory, from Africa to Vietnam and China. Laos is also an important transit, as well as origin, country for other wildlife products such as tigers, pangolins and bears, among others. High-level corruption plays a significant role in this market, with reports from 2016 revealing that officials at the highest levels of the state apparatus were involved in cutting deals with leading wildlife traffickers to move millions of dollars\u2019 worth of wildlife through select border crossings. Conversely, there are no significant non-renewable resource crime markets in Laos, although some liquified petroleum gas has been smuggled into the country from Thailand in recent years.","text - drugs":"Heroin trafficking is among the most profitable criminal markets in Laos, largely due to increasing domestic opium production as well as its shared borders with Myanmar and Thailand. Laos also has one of the fastest-growing synthetic-drug markets in South-eastern Asia, driven by wide accessibility, low prices and growing demand in surrounding economies. In recent years, methamphetamine has become especially popular among Lao youth. Laos also has a domestic cannabis-cultivation industry, which supplies domestic and Vietnamese markets, and has retail sales mainly concentrated in Laos\u2019 urban and tourist areas. Cannabis is also trafficked from Cambodia and Thailand through Laos. The cocaine trade in the country is relatively small and mostly involves foreign actors. Corruption among law-enforcement and border officials facilitates trafficking in most of the country\u2019s drug markets, particularly heroin and cannabis.","text - criminal actors":"There is evidence suggesting that criminal networks in Laos collude and cooperate with foreign groups in the region. Laos has especially struggled to tackle these networks since the country moved towards a more open economy in 1986, which allowed for closer ties to China and other regional countries, such as Vietnam and Thailand, and thereby opened the door for several foreign criminal actors from these countries to operate in Laos. These foreign criminal actors are mainly involved in the illegal wildlife trade; however, there have also been reports linking them to sex- and drug-trafficking in Laos. ##&& State-embedded actors facilitate some criminal markets in Laos through corruption, in the form of accepting bribes and sharing profits from criminal actors, particularly in the illegal wildlife trade and illicit logging markets. Cooperation with criminal actors occurs at all levels of the state apparatus, from low-level officials and law-enforcement personnel to the highest office in the country. Mafia-style groups, while present in Laos, are far less prevalent than other criminal-actor types.","text - leadership and governance":"Corruption exists at all levels of government in Laos, despite the government maintaining an anti-corruption agenda. Political patronage also pervades Laos\u2019 business sectors, and bribery is widespread. Meanwhile, the government\u2019s Ministry of Public Security has several branches aimed at tackling transnational organized crime and leads the National Steering Committee on Human Trafficking, which brings together all relevant governmental anti-trafficking stakeholders. In 2020, the government also introduced positive measures to protect victims of human trafficking. ##&& Laos has ratified several international treaties related to transnational organized crime, corruption and the illegal wildlife trade. Laos also cooperates with regional organizations on programmes and conventions aimed at tackling drug production and trafficking, arms trafficking, human trafficking and human smuggling. At the domestic level, the country lacks legislation to criminalize organized-criminal groups en masse but has addressed human trafficking under the 2016 Anti-Trafficking Law and the criminalization of sex- and labour-trafficking under the 2018 Penal Code. The government also has several laws addressing environmental crimes, including illicit wildlife trade and illicit logging. Nevertheless, legal loopholes remain. In 2016, the Laos Cabinet approved a national plan on narcotics control for 2016\u20132020.","text - criminal justice and security":"Although due process is enshrined in Lao law, it is routinely denied in practice, and long procedural delays are common. Rural communities are also encouraged to settle non-criminal disputes outside the formal judicial system. Furthermore, the country\u2019s prison system suffers from inadequate facilities and torture is occasionally reported, though the independent monitoring of prisons has been refused. Specialist law-enforcement and government bodies exist to curb all major criminal markets. However, Laos\u2019 porous borders with five countries make inspections and management difficult, particularly in the area of illegal wildlife trade. The porous borders also render the country highly susceptible to criminal actors, who often explicitly target border areas.","text - economic and financial environment":"Laos is among the countries with the highest risk of money laundering and terrorist financing in the world. Money laundering is relatively easy in the country because of its limited legal framework, poor financial regulation, weak border controls and reduced investigative capacity. However, in 2018, Laos\u2019 penal code set forth specific penalties for money laundering and, in 2019, Lao officials from various agencies completed training on basic financial investigations and anti-money-laundering techniques. The rise in corruption, organized crime and money laundering related to criminal markets has had a negative impact on Laos\u2019 economic development and regional integration. Furthermore, various factors, including difficulties in accessing finance and poor enforcement of regulations, have led to the proliferation of the informal economy in Laos, which, as a proportion of the country\u2019s economy, is one of the largest in the region.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Laos government has made improvements in offering official assistance to trafficking victims through cooperation with international and local non-governmental organizations, as well as the 2016 Anti-Trafficking Law, which entitles victims \u2013 although not foreign victims\u2013 to assistance programmes. The Lao government has also increased its organized-crime-prevention efforts and supported training on transnational organized crime for various stakeholders. Nevertheless, efforts to prevent human trafficking and other crimes remain disjointed amid resource challenges and limits placed on civil society actors, who often face kidnappings and government intimidation. Moreover, the majority of the country\u2019s media is state-owned, although some independent media outlets have emerged in recent years and Laos has joined other ASEAN countries in defending a free press.

Migrants face abuse and sexual exploitation. Although Lebanese nationals must shoulder costs for sponsoring migrants, sponsorship is illegally \u2018sold\u2019. Migrants forfeit their legal status if they leave their hotels or employers\u2019 houses without permission and sponsors often withhold passports. Due to COVID-19, some domestic workers have been abandoned and restrictions targeting Syrian refugees have been introduced. The exploitation of refugees has also greatly increased trafficking, as victims are forced into prostitution, begging, domestic servitude or hard labour in exchange for food and shelter. Finally, children are also internally trafficked within Lebanon. ##&& Lebanon is a destination and transit country for human smuggling. Poverty and the recent entry restrictions on Syrians have increased levels of smuggling, possibly facilitated by Hezbollah and the Syrian Army\u2019s Fourth Division. Smuggling occurs across legal and irregular crossings, particularly into the Beqaa Valley and at the Masnaa border crossing. Individuals persecuted by the Syrian regime pay more for smuggling services, while others are now being smuggled back into Syria. Until 2016, when Turkey introduced new visa requirements, Lebanon was a transit point for Syrians travelling to Turkey and on to Europe. Nowadays, illicit travel agencies sell these visas fraudulently.","text - trade":"Lebanon has been a transit, source and destination country for arms trafficking since its civil war, when foreign powers provided weapons. Small-arms proliferation is problematic as Lebanon has one of the highest firearm rates per capita. Thousands of rockets and missiles are imported annually, and some politicians face trafficking charges. Since the manifestation and elimination of ISIS-aligned factions, unlicensed arms possession has risen in Christian communities. Hezbollah also continues to develop its weapons arsenal, importing partly via Syria from Iran, while weapons are also smuggled out to Syria, Libya and other countries.","text - environment":"While the illicit flora trade is negligible, Lebanon is a source, transit and destination country for fauna trafficking, primarily birds but also reptiles and mammals, including tigers, leopards, bears and lions. Endangered species, seen as status symbols, are increasingly smuggled from Ukraine and Syria to local markets or onwards to Gulf countries. Sales are often advertised online, and animals are imported using a customs loophole whereby characteristics are omitted, likely aided by low-level corruption. Additionally, Lebanon is a source and destination country for gasoline and diesel smuggling, utilizing legitimate and uncontrolled border crossings. While lacking in natural resources, Lebanon is a transit country for precious metals, notably gold. The trade is difficult to track, enabling illicit gold to be resold into global markets, funding family clans, militias and non-state actors.","text - drugs":"Lebanon is one of the biggest producers of cannabis in the world, and the identification of cannabis as a possible government-revenue source has sparked a legalization debate. Earlier eradication efforts failed to introduce profitable alternatives, and the redirection of security efforts due to Syria\u2019s civil war enabled record production and arms acquisitions by drug organizations. Production occurs primarily within the Beqaa Valley, where there are thousands of outstanding arrest warrants and, in 2020, Lebanon reported a record seizure of 25 tonnes of hashish. The thriving amphetamine trade, namely involving Ecstasy and Captagon, caters to the local and Gulf markets, and the market has expanded beyond the Beirut elite to more conservative areas. Increasing seizures suggest that Lebanon is not only used to transfer Syrian pills but is also a source country due to the availability of cheap precursor chemicals because of the lack of monitoring of pharmacies and manufacturing plants. Meanwhile, Captagon production underwent a shift from Eastern Europe to the Middle East, including the Beqaa Valley and Beirut. While the Syrian conflict enables production, it also mitigates Syria as a transit route, turning Lebanon into a key hub. Prescription opioids, including Tramadol, are smuggled in from India, and Ecstasy is also primarily imported, although local production does occur. ##&& Cocaine and heroin markets are smaller, due to high costs and limited demand, with the Levant serving as a transit zone to the Gulf, Turkey and Europe. Despite its associated stigma and a decrease in cultivation and seizures, heroin use is increasing in Lebanon, illustrated by possession arrests. Cocaine, used by youth, the urban elite and foreign nationals, is the most expensive drug, and seizures have steadily increased as well, with reports alleging Hezbollah to be behind that spike. The drug enters by land from neighbouring countries and by sea and air from Latin America, North and East Africa, and is then distributed locally or shipped to Europe, Turkey, Jordan or Syria.","text - criminal actors":"In Lebanon, large and violent families or clans with a leadership cadre, known as \u2018Woujah\u2019, are capable of mobilizing armed militias and kidnapping for ransom, although they tend to adopt a strategy of largesse in their territories. Birth does not dictate leadership and, as their weapons outmatch some security agencies, they can act with impunity. Some have relations with the Syrian Assad family and cross the border without disrupting their operations. Clans lack indefinable membership, but control territory that the state cannot enter. Lebanese criminal networks are active in most markets, mainly in Beirut, the Beqaa Valley and the border regions. Many have Syrian members, especially those that exploit refugees. While some project their reach more freely into Syria, others use foreigners from Gulf countries or Eastern Europe, or link with Lebanese mafias in Europe and South America. Mafia groups may provide direction from a distance. ##&& State-embedded actors and security personnel provide operational support and political cover for cannabis, prostitution, currency forgery and smuggling from Syria. Low-level Internal Security Forces (ISF) members blackmail illegal enterprises, while political parties and militias indirectly control organized crime within their territories, ensuring sect members are not targeted. Criminal investigations are also used to exert political pressure. While Beqaa Valley cannabis farms are run by armed families, Hezbollah is also involved in smuggling, and its authority is recognized. Lebanese drug-trafficking groups in Latin America, North America and Europe have been linked to Hezbollah, with loyalists arrested for facilitating drug and human trafficking. Hezbollah is also said to be an Iranian proxy, developing weapons and smuggling pipelines. Syrian criminal actors often work with Lebanese counterparts to lure sex-trafficking and smuggling victims, while Palestinian contraband networks operate without scrutiny within refugee camps.","text - leadership and governance":"The country's widespread corruption and nepotism are punishable in the penal code, but enforcement is poor. There is no overarching counter-narcotics strategy and the public is unaware of how seized narcotics are disposed of. Although measures exist to curb human trafficking, minimum standards are not met. The exclusion of migrant domestic or sex workers from the Labour Code enables exploitation, and victim- and witness-protection clauses are lacking. Despite the prevalence of forced prostitution, few trafficking cases are brought to court. Furthermore, the deportation of Syrian refugees not only increases vulnerability but also contradicts the Lebanese constitution. When customs fees lost to human smuggling were cited as a potential government-revenue source, ISF set about closing irregular crossings. Corrupt elites funnel resources through patronage networks, facilitated by the lack of sanctions, and public discontent was exacerbated by the 2020 Beirut port explosion, with protesters unified across sectarian lines demanding sweeping social and economic reforms. ##&& Lebanon is party to treaties related to organized crime, corruption and terrorism, which is somewhat contradicted by the supply of weaponry to Hezbollah from Iran. The US, UK and EU attempt to develop the capacity of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) by funding programmes to manage borders, training soldiers and the ISF, building military bases and watchtowers, and providing military equipment. Cypriot and Lebanese regional authorities have agreed to collaborate to stem refugee movement to Cyprus. Regarding drugs, personal cannabis use is illegal and the ISF recently disrupted Captagon networks, in collaboration with Saudi Arabia, with maximum penalties applying to organized-crime perpetrators. Other concerns are current weapons laws that lack sufficient penalties, that civilians can be prosecuted in the Military Court and environmental laws that fail to mention organized crime.","text - criminal justice and security":"While Lebanon\u2019s penal code punishes organized crime, enforcement remains poor. The judiciary system suffers from a lack of judges, lengthy pre-trials, slow proceedings and case backlogs, with prisoners spending one year on average in pre-trial detention. Lebanese prisons are among the world\u2019s most crowded, exacerbated by a lack of preventive policies or coordination between judiciary and security officials, as well as insufficient investigative capacity. Prisons may even be recruiting grounds for organized crime. The EU, the UK and Canada have allocated funds to improve Lebanon\u2019s judiciary and prisons, and Lebanon\u2019s justice minister vowed to eradicate judicial corruption, as politicians frequently interfere to protect sect members. In 2020, Lebanon\u2019s parliament was set to vote on legislation that would pardon perpetrators of non-violent crimes and reduce prison sentences, but this was postponed indefinitely due to a backlash regarding a clause pardoning public officials accused of serious offences. ##&& Corruption in law-enforcement agencies is high and employment follows power-sharing arrangements, making it prone to criminal infiltration. The security apparatus, including the human-trafficking unit, is underfunded, lacking staff and equipment, with no focus on arms-trafficking prevention. As the Ministry of Interior\u2019s legally mandated Central Counter-narcotics Office exists only on paper, the ISF handles this work but struggles to apprehend traffickers, resulting in increased military operations. Intelligence services have overlapping mandates and competing interests, and departments blame failures on others. ##&& Lebanon has a relatively unified territory, although certain areas are loyal to sectarian or tribal militias. The Syrian\u2013Lebanese border is a trafficking hotspot, control of which is compounded by mountainous terrain and police corruption. Drug enclaves exist where the state cannot exert full control and the army similarly lacks control over Palestinian refugee camps. The army and security services attempt to improve territorial integrity but authorities are subject to political and sectarian interference. While the army successfully uprooted a Beqaa Valley ISIS faction, the LAF cannot control Hezbollah\u2019s weapons-smuggling.","text - economic and financial environment":"Lebanon is at risk for money laundering and terrorist financing. The industry is overseen by the country's Central Bank, but Lebanon\u2019s banking system is nonetheless suspected of money laundering.

Doing business in Lebanon is considered relatively difficult and many larger firms have political connections. Lebanon has one of the highest global debt levels and therefore relies on donors to improve infrastructure. Austerity measures introduced to placate funders instigated protests and tension between political classes. Protests and COVID-19 have contributed to unemployment, with over a million in poverty. There are no restrictions on foreign money exchange or capital movement but business venues are limited and the free economic system allows criminal networks to operate with ease. The difference between black-market and official lira rates also incentivizes money laundering.","text - civil society and social protection":"Lebanon lacks a clear strategy to counter organized crime. While drug users are considered victims, limited capacity means that only a fraction have access to treatment. Courts do not follow up on treatment provided by non-governmental organizations, private clinics and hospitals, mainly located in Mount Lebanon and Beirut. Drug-prevention and -awareness programmes are largely left to NGOs, while churches and religious institutions run most schools and health facilities. There are limited efforts to prevent trafficking, but migrant-worker and trafficking complaint hotlines lack follow-up data, and potential victims have been accused of irregular immigration and arrested, detained or deported. The judiciary may conceal witness identities but lacks a victim-centred approach and protection. ##&& Civil society organizations often provide the only services for victims, but most are small, have governance and organizational needs, and receive insufficient state support. Hezbollah is seen in a different, more legitimate, light than the state and can therefore exert pressure on organized crime. However, it has also recognized its limitations and, not wanting to be perceived as a transgressor, has allowed the state to conduct raids on drug dealers within its territories. Lebanon\u2019s media outlets are extensions of political parties or businesses and press freedom frequently comes under attack. While the media do report on drug seizures, they play a minimal role in spreading awareness.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Beirut","GDP (current $US million)":"51991.63","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"6855713","Land Area (sq. km)":"10450","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"89","Freedom in the World Index":"43","Human Development Index":"0.74","Global Peace Index":"2.83","Democracy Index":"4.16","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"25","GDP per capita (current US$)":"7584","1":"6.77","1.1":"5.90","1.2":"7.63","2":"4.00"},{"Corresp":"105","ISO-3":"MYS","Country":"Malaysia","ISO-2":"MY","Continent":"Asia","Region":"South-Eastern Asia","Flag file":"my.png","1.

Malaysia is primarily a destination country for labour trafficking because of its perceived stable economy and geographical position, being located in the vicinity of countries such as Thailand and Myanmar. Typical origin countries of victims of human trafficking in Malaysia include Bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. With regard to sex trafficking, however, Malaysia is primarily a source country and Malaysian women and children are trafficked to Singapore, Japan, Canada, US, Europe and Australia. Within Malaysia, sex trafficking victims often work in brothels. Children, especially girls from rural areas, are particularly vulnerable to internal trafficking for sex slavery. Actors involved in human trafficking are primarily large organized crime syndicates comprising foreign actors and criminal networks. State-embedded actors are also believed to be involved in some cases. ##&& Malaysia is both a major transit and destination country for human smuggling, with the majority of irregular migrants arriving from Myanmar, Indonesia and Bangladesh. As with human trafficking, Malaysia\u2019s strategic geographical position and labour shortages contribute to its position as a major destination country for human smuggling. It is also a transit point for nationals from Southeast Asia destined for the Middle East, Europe, North America and Australia, often through the combined use of air and overland travel. Actors involved in human smuggling are primarily foreign actors who deceive undocumented workers into believing that they are migrating via regular channels.","text - trade":"Although Malaysia\u2019s gun legislation is restrictive, crimes involving small and light weapons have increased in recent years. The country\u2019s strategic location near South Thailand and Mindanao has contributed to the cross-border smuggling of small arms and light weapons. Arms are generally trafficked along the Thai and Kalimantan borders, as well as in the south of Malaysia, via boats from Indonesia. Some of these small and light weapons are destined for use in Peninsular Malaysia, while others are shipped onwards. The rise in arms trafficking in recent years has increased in part because of demand driven by violent extremist actors in the country. Firearms remain easily accessible through purchasing and rental services. There have also been numerous sightings of illicit firearms at rallies throughout Malaysia, and there are issues related to corruption of law enforcement officers who claim to lose their firearms.","text - environment":"Criminal markets in flora, fauna and natural resources are pervasive across Malaysia. Although the country has tough laws against the practice, hundreds of cases of illicit logging have been recorded in recent years. Illicit activity in the forestry sector may have contributed to rapid deforestation and has resulted in significant revenue losses. Sarawak and Sabah on the island of Borneo appear to be key sources of illicitly logged wood, with data suggesting that China and Vietnam, and to a lesser extent Thailand and India, are importing it. State-embedded actors dominate this activity, including corrupt government officials and government-supported groups. Reported issues include illegal practices in the issuance of licences for plantations and the violation of native customary rights. ##&& Being one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, Malaysia has become a target for criminal networks engaged in wildlife poaching and trafficking. The country is both a source and transit hub for a wide variety of internationally trafficked wildlife products, including pangolin, tigers, birds and reptiles. Persistent poaching has reduced the Malayan tiger population to fewer than 200 animals, a situation exacerbated by the threat of habitat loss and encroachment. Malaysia has also emerged as a key transit hub for the global ivory trade. Typically, the ivory originates in Africa, then is exported to Malaysia, where paperwork is falsified, and the shipment continues to destination countries. In addition to domestically poached animals and ivory, Malaysia has become a transit country for Testudines originating in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Madagascar. ##&& A criminal market exists in Malaysia for illegal gold and bauxite. The annual output of bauxite ore has increased significantly in the past few decades and Malaysia is now among the world\u2019s top producers. It is believed that a large proportion of this bauxite ore is illegally mined. This results in considerable environmental damage and lost revenue. ","text - drugs":"Malaysia is a transit hub for drugs and a destination country for heroin, in addition to various types of synthetic drugs. The synthetic drug trade is the largest criminal drug market in Malaysia and the country is both a transit and destination country. MDMA, ketamine and methamphetamine, in particular, appear to be the most widely consumed hard drugs in Malaysia and authorities have witnessed a sharp increase in the consumption and seizure of these drugs in recent years. While local demand is strong, drugs with higher purity are often moved to richer markets such as those in South Korea, Australia, Japan and New Zealand. ##&& Malaysia is also a major transit country for heroin destined for Indonesia, Singapore, China, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Australia. While the heroin consumer base in Malaysia remains at moderate levels, evidence suggests that consumption rates are on the decline. Actors involved in the illicit heroin trade in Malaysia are both transnational criminal networks and foreign trafficking organizations, particularly Pakistani syndicates. ##&& As with the heroin trade, Malaysia is primarily a transit country for cocaine, which is smuggled via shipping containers. Cocaine is less popular in Malaysia than other drugs and the domestic market for it is relatively small. Actors involved in the illicit cocaine trade are predominantly foreign actors, primarily Nigerian syndicates. The market for cannabis in Malaysia is also relatively smaller than other drug markets and, while cannabis usage does occur, consumption rates appear to be lower compared to most other countries. In 2018, the Malaysian government discussed the possibility of legalizing cannabis for medical purposes in the future, though it is unclear what impact this may have on the criminal market.","text - criminal actors":"Foreigners are among the most prominent criminal actors in Malaysia, particularly in the drug trade. The market for cocaine trade is dominated by Nigerian syndicates, while drug trafficking groups from Pakistan, Myanmar, China and Thailand are involved in heroin trafficking. Taiwanese criminal organizations and Australian outlaw motorcycle gangs are known to be involved in the trafficking of methamphetamines. Malaysia is home toa number of gangs that exhibit mafia-style behaviour and are also involved in criminal markets, including the drug trade. One of the largest of these is Gang 04, more commonly known as Hua Kee. Though many of them have been crippled by high-profile arrests or killings, other prominent gangs in Malaysia include Mamak, Gang 07, and Gang 08. ##&& Human trafficking networks in Malaysia, and South-eastern Asia more generally, often operate in independent or loosely related groups. Similarly, although migrant smuggling groups tend to be decentralized, loose associations of individuals who operate outside any hierarchical command and control structure, there are exceptions. For example, the smuggling of Indonesian migrants to Malaysia involves organized networks, led by prominent local figures, that operate unlicensed recruitment agencies in both countries to facilitate irregular entry and job placement. State-embedded actors play key roles in enabling the criminal markets for fauna and flora as well as human trafficking. In the case of ivory, paperwork is falsified by corrupt state-embedded actors to enable the illegal export of ivory to China.","text - leadership and governance":"The Malaysian government has not communicated clearly that combating organized crime is a high priority, and there is significant scope for better leadership in the fight against transnational organized crime. Levels of perceived corruption in Malaysia are moderate and lower than for most other countries in South-eastern Asia. Nevertheless, corruption, as the 1MDB political scandal involving the country\u2019s then prime minister clearly showed, continues to be an issue. The country\u2019s legal and institutional framework to combat and prevent corruption has not always proven to be fully effective in deterring graft. ##&& Malaysia has signed and ratified the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its protocols relating to human trafficking and smuggling of migrants, as well as the UN Convention against Corruption. The country has shown a willingness for international cooperation to deal with these challenges, engaging with the ASEAN Regional Forum, for example. The nation has played an important role in South-eastern Asia\u2019s attempts to enhance bilateral and multilateral mechanisms between law enforcement agencies to combat transnational crime. Malaysia\u2019s national legislation criminalizes the trafficking of arms, humans and drugs, while the penal code contains provisions for punishing members of a group engaged in organized criminality.","text - criminal justice and security":"In Malaysia, the judiciary is headed by the Supreme Court, which is subdivided into the trial and appellate divisions. While the judiciary is independent in theory, it is often subject to interference or influence from other arms of the government. There are certain units specifically focused on organized crime-related matters in the country, though no overarching judicial authority exists in this regard. Malaysian prisons currently suffer from considerable overcrowding, largely because a significant proportion of the prison population is in pre-trial detention. Furthermore, there are reports of abuse and sometimes unsafe conditions in prisons. In general, law enforcement is well equipped, but its reputation has been tarnished by high levels of perceived corruption and low levels of public trust. Police reform is ongoing with efforts being made to create a complaints mechanism. Malaysia\u2019s geography, which includes long coastlines and forested and hilly areas, makes border control a challenge. This exacerbates its vulnerability to criminal flows and makes the country an easy transit market for criminal activities.","text - economic and financial environment":"Malaysia is an open and dynamic economy. It is heavily reliant on trade and provides a good foundation for private sector development. The country has enjoyed solid growth rates for several years, but faces a medium-to-high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. The country falls largely in line with internationally endorsed global standards against money laundering and terrorist financing. Among the freest economies, the country\u2019s business climate is favourable to small and medium-sized enterprises.","text - civil society and social protection":"There are a number of laws in place to protect witnesses and whistleblowers and the country\u2019s witness protection programme appears to provide effective protection, with no casualties having been recorded. Among the first countries in the region to build up and implement a national action plan for crime prevention, Malaysia has achieved several milestones in tackling crime. The Malaysian Crime Prevention Foundation (MCPF), originally founded in conjunction with Japan, has played a central role in efforts to reduce crime rates in several local communities. The MCPF, the first chapter of the organization to be established outside Japan, aims to promote awareness of crime prevention and to rehabilitate offenders. At the same time, however, the relationship between civil society and the government has become strained. In 2015, a coalition of NGOs sought reforms to the electoral system. The government responded by declaring their rallies illegal and threatening them with military action. Freedom of the press has been under pressure in the past few years, but for the most part, independent media can report freely.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Kuala Lumpur","GDP (current $US million)":"364681.37","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"31949777","Land Area (sq. km)":"330345","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"56.9","Freedom in the World Index":"51","Human Development Index":"0.81","Global Peace Index":"1.53","Democracy Index":"7.19","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"51","GDP per capita (current US$)":"11414","1":"5.94","1.1":"6.25","1.2":"5.63","2":"5.83"},{"Corresp":"106","ISO-3":"MDV","Country":"Maldives","ISO-2":"MV","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Southern Asia","Flag file":"mv.png","1.

The scale of the human trafficking market is large, relative to the size of the country. Human trafficking victims are often exploited for bonded labour in the construction sector or for sexual exploitation. Victims of labour trafficking tend to be men of Indian and Bangladeshi origin tricked into debt bondage or having their wages or identity documents with held. Victims of sex trafficking tend to be women from Southern Asia and the remote islands, serving either the local population or around tourist resorts. Children are particularly vulnerable to being sent to the capital, Mal\u00e9, to work as domestic servants. ##&& The nature of the criminal market for human smuggling is closely linked to the market for human trafficking and is similarly driven by the expansion in the construction and tourism industries, which increases the demand for foreign labour and creates opportunities for criminal and corrupt practices. ","text - trade":"Although evidence suggests that the arms trafficking and ammunition smuggling market is of limited scale and scope in the Maldives, there are anecdotal reports that corrupt actors within the state apparatus have been selling off arms, and the National Defence Force has long been associated with the illicit movement and storage of arms. Other reports have been concerned with the Maldives\u2019 armed Islamist Salafi groups, which have keen interests in acquiring and distributing arms to other places in Southern Asia and further west to the Middle East.","text - environment":"The only environmental criminal market proven to exist to any substantial degree in the Maldives is the fauna crimes market. Illegal wildlife trade happens on a substantial scale and conditions in the Maldives are ripe for the market to expand in the coming years. The decline of European tourism has been met with a rise in the number of East Asian visitors who often demand wildlife products and engage in practices such as shark finning. Products such as the jaws and teeth of Maldivian sharks can be found for sale in tourist shops across Mal\u00e9. Shark finning, the selling of stingray skin, damage to coral, overfishing and similar practices could have a negative impact on marine productivity, upon which many industries and locals rely. Conversely, there is no evidence to support the existence of flora or non-renewable crime markets in the country.","text - drugs":"The most pervasive drug market in the country is the heroin market, and the Maldives plays an important role as a transit point in the regional heroin trade in Asia and Oceania. Informal links between drug trafficking organizations and high-level state officials have existed for many years and the criminal actors who move heroin from Pakistan into the Maldives enjoy considerable levels of protection from coast guard and customs officials. Moreover, the domestic market for heroin in the country appears to be on the rise. The Maldives is also a stopover for cannabis enroute to South and South East Asia. Cannabis use in the Maldives is relatively common and, for the most part, socially acceptable. ##&& The cocaine and synthetic drug markets are far less pervasive in the country, but the Maldives does act as a transit country for cocaine that originates in various North and South American and European locations, and is transported towards Thailand, the Philippines and India. The trafficking of cocaine through the Maldives is believed to be managed by international criminal groups. The local market for cocaine is small, with domestic demand mostly generated by tourists and a small group of wealthy elites. Finally, relatively small volumes of synthetic drugs also transit the Maldives. While the domestic market for synthetic drugs is negligible, crystal meth use is reportedly on the rise and there have been small local seizures of the drug. Moreover, the Maldives\u2019 proximity to India, a large-scale supplier of precursor chemicals, has raised concerns of problems in the future.","text - criminal actors":"The Maldives is believed to host a range of different criminal actors, including local and foreign mafia-style groups, state-embedded criminal actors, violent extremist organizations and decentralized criminal networks. Mafia-style groups in the Maldives are not clearly structured, and membership can be hard to identify. Nevertheless, there is believed to be around two dozen gangs with substantial memberships in Mal\u00e9 and its suburb of Hulhumal\u00e9. Some gangs in the Maldives are believed to have been co-opted by state-embedded criminals, including the country\u2019s now-jailed former vice president, who claimed to be capable of controlling a substantial part of the country\u2019s criminal underworld. Gangs have received payments and various favours in exchange for participating in protests, starting riots, destroying property or injuring opponents. However, the current administration appears to be taking steps to reverse this trend and collusion between state-embedded criminal actors and gangs may have diminished in recent years. ##&& Foreign actors have an important role in criminal markets such as drug trafficking and have formed linkages with local criminal organizations. International drug trafficking organizations, particularly Pakistani heroin traffickers, may have a sustained presence in the Maldives. Foreign decentralized criminal networks are co-involved in the human trafficking and human smuggling markets. Moreover, the potential involvement of al-Qaeda and the Islamic State in the Indian subcontinent has been a source of concern.There are allegations that these violent extremist actors have forged links with local gangs and are involved in recruitment and money laundering for financing terrorist activities.","text - leadership and governance":"After decades of authoritarian rule, the Maldives held its first multi-party presidential election in 2008. Democratic progress has been gradual and there are still severe restrictions on opposition activities and on free expression and assembly, growing Islamist militancy as well as politicization of state institutions. Nevertheless, the opposition victory in 2018 is believed to be a manifestation of democratic progress in the country and has led to increased political will to combat organized crime and corruption. While corruption, state capture and state-embedded criminality remain pervasive and systemic issues, the new governmenthas taken a more coherent approach to corruption and organized crime, as is evident in the introduction of anti-corruption reforms, the strengthening of oversight mechanisms and the suspension of two government ministers charged with corruption. ##&& Although the Maldives has not yet ratified the UNTOC, it claims to be working towards it, and all other major relevant treaties pertaining to organized crime have been signed. The Maldives cooperates with international partners in a range of forums, including a regional intelligence-sharing platform for Southern Asia and ongoing technical cooperation with INTERPOL, UNODC and other UN agencies. The Maldives also has a number of extradition treaties in place and has proven willing to extradite foreign criminals. Domestically, large gaps remain in the legal framework for combating organized crime, but there are sustained attempts, in cooperation with international organizations and UN agencies, to create stronger legislation. Over the past decade, for example, a series of laws on human trafficking and drug trafficking have been introduced.","text - criminal justice and security":"The Maldivian judiciary sorely lacks the ability to provide adequate access to justice and the rule of law. Criminal justice procedures are not outlined clearly in legislation, creating considerable legal uncertainty and making it harder to convict organized criminals. Moreover, high levels of corruption in the judiciary weakens the accountability of, and trust toward, the courts, as well as the capacity to ensure high-level convictions. Similarly, the prison system in the Maldives is weak and prison conditions are poor. Law enforcement bodies struggle with persistently low levels of public trust and high levels of corruption and bribery. The maintenance of territorial integrity is another challenge in the Maldives. The scattering of around 2000 islands that constitute the Maldives and its geographic location on crucial shipping routes render the country susceptible to transnational illicit flows. There are signs, however, of a political willingness to address the challenges in the criminal justice sector. Prison reform is currently being addressed by UNODC-facilitated training, while the Strategic Action Plan 2019\u20132023, drafted by the Maldives government, identifies rule of law and judicial reform as a government priority.","text - economic and financial environment":"The private sector in the Maldives suffers from low access to credit, difficulties in registering properties and weak minority-investor protections. The market is characterized by monopolistic tendencies and high levels of control by a small handful of ultra-rich resort owners. As a result, there is a lack of economic opportunities in the private sector. Furthermore, despite revelations of major money laundering schemes in 2016 and high-level political scandals, anti-money laundering measures remain notoriously weak. Both the Financial Intelligence Unit and the Bank of Maldives are subject to political interference and there have been few credible efforts to investigate or prosecute financial crime linked to organized crime groups.","text - civil society and social protection":"Although the Maldives has a legal framework in place for witness protection, witness protection programmes are almost non-existent and, insofar as they do exist, extremely ineffective. Most, if not all, drug treatment facilities in the country are run by individuals or NGOs. In 2018, the Maldivian police launched a community-policing initiative with neighbourhood-support officers assigned in the capital Mal\u00e9 and its suburbs Hulhumal\u00e9 and Villimal\u00e9. However, any prevention initiatives implemented by law enforcement are unlikely to have any significant positive effect until the police force undergoes significant reform to end infiltration by those linked to political power and organized crime. ##&& There is an energetic civil society sector in the Maldives, but its relationship with the state is not good. Similarly, the media in the Maldives continue to be a source of resilience and play a critical role in discussions around organized crime and corruption. However, journalists do not always operate without fear and have been subjected to threats by gang members. Improvements to the media environment have been made in recent years since the new administration entered office.

Women and girls are sometimes married abroad by either their parents or intermediaries to men across Asia and especially in China, a practice that often ends up in abuse. Such brokered marriages are used to compel victims to work in domestic servitude or prostitution. In addition, orphans and children living in families affected by violence and alcoholism are targeted by traffickers. Children are often exploited in artisanal mining in the country or sent to China on visas and taken advantage of upon arrival. Transgender women in Mongolia are also vulnerable to trafficking due to discrimination in the formal job markets. There are reports of increasing demand for child sex in Ulaanbaatar as well as in mining towns and border cities, generated mostly by tourists from South Korea and Japan. Exploitation of foreign victims in Mongolia is common, especially of Chinese and North Korean men in mining, construction and the restaurant industry. A small number of Russian and Ukrainian women are trafficked to Mongolia on short-term visas for sex work. Corruption allegedly plays a part in trafficking, with officials and police officers facilitating exploitation. ##&& There is no information to suggest that human smuggling is a major market in Mongolia, although Mongolians are being smuggled to Western Europe, Japan and the US. One possible method of recruiting people to be smuggled is the advertisement of \u2018asylum trips\u2019 to Europe by travel agencies. Reportedly, smugglers use air routes through China, Hong Kong and South Korea, rather than land routes. Before China tightened its border control with Mongolia, Mongolia was a transit country for North Koreans being smuggled to South Korea. ","text - trade":"Although unlicensed firearms have been seized in Mongolia in recent years, mostly from hunters, at this point in time, arms trafficking is not considered a criminal market of concern in the country. Levels of gun crime in Mongolia are extremely low and there are no armed conflicts in the region to which Mongolian arms flow.","text - environment":"A strong local demand for wood conditions the existence of illegal logging in Mongolia. For the most part, small-scale logging for subsistence occurs at the local level, but illicit large-scale commercial operations exist as well. The latter are likely involved in exporting wood to China, where a partial ban on logging has created demand for timber. Likewise, external demand from China is a large driver of Mongolia\u2019s wildlife trade. Reportedly, illicit trade has declined since 2005, but that has been attributed to declining animal populations. For the most part, scattered criminal networks, delivering animals and animal parts on demand, dominate the illegal trade. Mongolia is also a transit country for wildlife products from Russia to China via the north\u2013south railroad that crosses the country. On a local level, more than a third of Mongolians use wildlife in some form, either commercially or for subsistence, which suggests that poaching is rampant. Should hunting continue at its current rate, the ability of the wildlife populations to replenish will be significantly reduced. Moreover, corruption and bribery lead to the issuance of hunting licenses that are inappropriate and inconsistent with conservation efforts, further deepening the issue. Illegal gold mining is another form of environmental crime that has a notable environmental and financial impact. Artisanal mining largely employs Mongolians and has become crucial to the livelihood of thousands of people in rural areas, either directly or indirectly. However, the driving factor behind Mongolia\u2019s legal and illegal mining sector is exports, where Chinese criminal networks play an important role in illicit flows. Gold is also sold and refined in Mongolia, and later smuggled and sold to foreign buyers, predominately Chinese, at market prices.","text - drugs":"There is little documented evidence on a domestic heroin market. Generally, heroin seizures are infrequent but large, leaving uncertainty as to how large and consolidated the heroin market is in Mongolia. Drug use is concentrated in Ulaanbaatar but is on the increase in the provinces as well, which might also be the case for heroin. The cocaine market similarly small in scope, limited almost entirely to the wealthy and to foreign recreational users. ##&& Cannabis grows naturally in Mongolia, making it easily accessible and, consequently, the most popular drug in the country. In spite of that, prevalence is not significant. Historically, cannabis has been smuggled to China, refined into hashish and smuggled back to Mongolia. There is no recent evidence to support the existence of such a flow. More recently, however, hashish parcels coming from the US, the Netherlands and Spain have been seized, which might suggest a shift in hashish smuggling flows. Overall, however, cannabis does not appear to be an important source of profit for organized crime in Mongolia. Conversely, the synthetic drugs trade in Mongolia and the trade in methamphetamine coming from China in particular is considerable. Airmail appears to be a prominent smuggling method, although methamphetamine has been smuggled through the border with China as well. In addition, along with the rising quantities of seized synthetic drugs, which might indicate an increase in domestic demand, methamphetamine labs have been dismantled in Mongolia, close to the Chinese border. ","text - criminal actors":"Most criminal markets in Mongolia depend on foreign ties to function. As indicated, illegal gold miners in Mongolia rely on criminal networks, including Chinese networks, to export their product. Chinese nationals have also been implicated in and arrested on charges of cybercrime in Mongolia. Additionally, there have been reports of a Korean organized crime group laundering money through Mongolia\u2019s construction sector. Loose criminal networks are another prominent feature of organized crime in Mongolia. Such networks have ties to foreign actors and facilitate trafficking flows, as most criminal markets in the country are driven by foreign demand. Similar to foreign actors, domestic criminal networks operate in illegal mining, money laundering and wildlife crime. There are few reports of violence by loose criminal networks in Mongolia. ##&& Corruption is a major challenge for Mongolia and illegal activities are often facilitated by state actors. Politicians, at both local and national levels, have allegedly been involved in a range of organized crime activities, mostly illegal mining. Although there are organized crime groups operating in Mongolia exhibiting some characteristics of mafia-style groups, these are not widespread and their influence on society is minimal.","text - leadership and governance":"Political parties in Mongolia do not seem to campaign on organized crime. Instead, corruption and economic and political mismanagement seem to be the main focus. Nevertheless, the government has responded to the rise of specific crime markets in the country, implementing judicial and law enforcement reforms. Corruption has been a decade-long issue in Mongolia and concerns have emerged in relation to attempts by the country\u2019s president to expand and consolidate presidential power, thereby eroding democracy. However, there is no evidence to suggest that organized crime has penetrated the political system. Despite corruption featuring strongly on political agendas, efforts to counter it have not had the desired effect. One anti-corruption measure was the establishment of a body tasked with investigating corruption \u2013 the Independent Authority against Corruption (IAAC) \u2013 but little has come out of its work. In 2019, reforms were drafted and implemented to improve Mongolia's anti-corruption framework and align it with international standards. Their effect is yet to be assessed. ##&& Mongolia is party to all relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. The country appears constructive in promoting international cooperation. There are no reports of international organizations or other countries reprimanding Mongolia for being obstructive, although some tensions with partner states have been identified. Foreign law enforcement entities cooperate with their Mongolian counterparts through INTERPOL, while domestic customs authorities report frequent cooperation and exchange of information with counterparts in countering trafficking flows. In line with the country\u2019s commitments to international anti-organized crime treaties and conventions, Mongolia\u2019s legal framework sufficiently covers all organized crime offences of interest to the index. Furthermore, anti-drug laws were strengthened in 2020, and an ongoing debate aims to reform the country\u2019s legal framework so that emerging threats are accounted for as well. ","text - criminal justice and security":"The judiciary in Mongolia is professionalized and members of the system make use of a number of ongoing training programmes. Nevertheless, corruption and political influence are problematic, leading to favourable rulings and inconsistencies in court decisions. There are no specialized judicial units responsible for investigating and prosecuting organized crime. The prison system suffers deficiencies and allegations of mistreatment and torture have surfaced in Mongolian prisons. Specialized anti-organized crime units within law enforcement agencies in Mongolia have been formed, and the general intelligence agency in the country is tasked with investigating instances of transnational organized crime. As part of cooperation initiatives, such units make use of capacity-building programmes, but assessments of the effectiveness of these units is difficult. As with the judiciary, corruption appears to be an issue, with bribery being ubiquitous, especially among low-ranking officers. Worryingly, Mongolia borders with two of the most significant organized crime markets in the world \u2013 Russia and China \u2013 and border management is difficult. This, along with the risk of corruption in customs administration, translates into an increased vulnerability to illicit flows.","text - economic and financial environment":"Mongolia has made high-level commitments to improve its AML\/CFT framework and was removed from the EU Tax Blacklist in 2018. Nevertheless, the country remains on the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s grey list with key deficiencies in AML\/CFT legislation as well as persistent constraints on law enforcement\u2019s activities in regard to combating money laundering. Additionally, a financial investigation unit functions within the Bank of Mongolia, but the corruption that permeates the latter hinders the work of the unit. Thus, risk of money laundering and terrorist financing in Mongolia remains very high. Conversely, the economic regulatory framework in the country is somewhat conducive to doing business, although shortcomings exist. One of the key problems for companies in Mongolia is the lack of transparent and corruption-free frameworks to challenge regulations and settle disputes. This, at least in part, is due to perceived substantial corruption in the judiciary. Corruption within the land administration also contributes to difficulties that undermine the business climate, whereas land ownership laws for foreigners hinder foreign investments and open up more opportunities for corruption.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim support facilities in Mongolia are inadequate and availability of psychosocial care is limited. A culture of victim blaming is still present in the country and victim-centred investigation techniques are underdeveloped. The government sponsors NGOs that support victims of trafficking and has a consular fund to aid victims exploited abroad, but proactive victim identification is lacking. A witness protection unit operates within the structure of the Mongolian police. Medical care for drug users is also insufficient and limited to detoxification treatments. Furthermore, drug use carries harsh penalties and, instead of help, users are pushed through the criminal justice system. In terms of prevention, Mongolia has a national anti-trafficking programme in place, which focuses on awareness-raising. Public awareness campaigns against corruption and drug use have also been implemented and a training and information centre to raise awareness on drugs was established in 2019. Arguably, however, action plans on relevant issues, such as anti-corruption or anti-trafficking, have not been designed or implemented effectively. In addition, social workers and local government officials who might work with vulnerable groups may benefit from further training on prevention. ##&& Civil society is active in Mongolia, especially in human trafficking research and victim care, but also in anti-corruption, supporting the work of the IAAC. Overall, NGOs and the government cooperate well and mechanisms for the formalization of their collaboration through memorandums of understanding are in place. Mongolia has made significant progress in media freedom over the past years, although heavy concentration of media ownership and affiliation with the political parties remain problematic. The 2017 changes to the country\u2019s defamation laws emerged as an issue of concern, with more than half of the country\u2019s defamation cases being brought against journalists.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Ulaanbaatar","GDP (current $US million)":"13996.72","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"3225167","Land Area (sq. km)":"1564116","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"52.3","Freedom in the World Index":"84","Human Development Index":"0.74","Global Peace Index":"1.72","Democracy Index":"6.48","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"35","GDP per capita (current US$)":"4340","1":"4.02","1.1":"3.90","1.2":"4.13","2":"5.08"},{"Corresp":"120","ISO-3":"MMR","Country":"Myanmar","ISO-2":"MM","Continent":"Asia","Region":"South-Eastern Asia","Flag file":"mm.png","1.

There is global demand for Myanmar\u2019s timber, from China and India to Europe and the US. Myanmar is also home to a significant illegal wildlife market, acting as a source and transit country for illegal wildlife products. Fauna crimes are particularly concentrated at the borders with Thailand and China, where demand is high for endangered wildlife species, and is aided by the country\u2019s porous borders. Myanmar also has its own large domestic market, and traffickers are increasingly using social media sites to sell animal products illegally. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is also widespread in Myanmar, and corrupt government and law enforcement officials are very active participants in the market. ##&& Finally, Myanmar is a significant source country for metallic minerals such as gold and copper, as well as precious stones such as jade and diamonds, with a large demand for these commodities coming from China. Corruption is rampant, allowing illicit mining activities to flourish, especially in conflict-affected territories where groups such as the Kachin Independence Organization and regional army commanders are the beneficiaries.

Heroin use accounts for the majority of drug treatment admissions in Myanmar. ##&& Myanmar also hosts one of the largest synthetic drug markets in the world, particularly for methamphetamine, where it receives abundant precursor chemicals from China. Meth is trafficked to all of its neighbouring states and this market alone generates several billion dollars a year. Key actors in Myanmar\u2019s synthetic drug trade include local armed groups, transnational criminal organizations and corrupt state officials, meaning that market profits feed directly into the political and security infrastructure of the country. ##&& While Myanmar does not have a considerable cocaine trade, it is increasingly being utilized as a transit country by international syndicates taking advantage of the ongoing conflicts. While most cocaine is smuggled in small packages on international flights leaving the Middle East, there are also concerns around seaports such as Shwepyithar Industrial Zone.

Although there does not appear to be widespread criminal network structures, there are loose criminal groups particularly concentrated in the drug and non-renewable resources markets. These networks are often connected to government officials and there is growing evidence of Chinese crime networks partnering with Burmese armed groups to control the flow of illicit commodities across the borders. However, there appears to only be a low level of violence from these groups in relation to organized crime activities. ##&& High-level government officials and military leaders are heavily involved in transnational organized crime, especially in the drug trafficking market, where some are directly involved in poppy cultivation in Shan state. Political involvement in criminal markets is pervasive, as evidenced by high-profile cases of former and current leaders\u2019 involvement in the illicit jade trade and timber trafficking. Chinese criminal groups are intimately involved in almost all of Myanmar\u2019s most prominent criminal markets, and they have also been important for supplying weapons to armed groups in the country. The notable transnational drug syndicate, Sam Gor, also controls much of the production and shipments of synthetic drugs in Myanmar\u2019s Shan state.","text - leadership and governance":"Despite an official transition to democracy with partially free elections in 2012, Myanmar retains many characteristics of a military regime. The military holds significant power over the illegal drug trade and many other criminal markets, and the government struggles to control military actions. Corruption is widespread throughout all areas of the state and public trust is extremely low. Moreover, Myanmar suffers from several ongoing internal conflicts, meaning that Myanmar is a highly fragile state. Myanmar\u2019s state infrastructure is highly corrupt, especially in areas of regulatory quality, the rule of law and government effectiveness. Despite the government\u2019s efforts, through its anti-corruption commission, to investigate and prosecute acts of corruption, the military regime sabotages any attempt to curb corruption in the country. However, despite the fact that the commission cannot investigate members of the military, it has increased its investigations of other state actors in recent years. ##&& There appears to be a willingness to cooperate with international counterparts through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the UN, and there are regional and bilateral anti-drug trafficking mechanisms in place in Myanmar. Importantly, agreements have recently been reached with China to allow for greater cross-border intelligence sharing with neighbouring Chinese provinces and capacity-building efforts for Kachin-based law enforcement. Myanmar also cooperates with the EU to increase effectiveness and accountability within its police force.

Many human rights abuses are perpetrated by government troops who are immune to judicial punishment, and while there have been calls for greater judicial independence, the judicial framework is currently centralized and under executive control. The prison system is drastically overcrowded, and inmates are subject to human rights abuses and harsh conditions. ##&& Myanmar\u2019s porous borders create an ideal environment for cross-border criminal trafficking operations due to its highly difficult terrain, ongoing conflicts in border regions and endemic corruption among its border officials. There is much cross-border movement by armed ethnic groups, and the lack of border security infrastructure such as roads and communication links have rendered some states safe havens for criminal groups. The border regions of Kachin and Shan in particular are run by armed ethnic groups and significantly lack law enforcement capabilities. The number of officers employed by the Myanmar police force falls short of international standards, and in addition to being under-resourced financially, they are widely distrusted by local communities due to their reputation for brutality and corruption. However, officers have recently been distributed more evenly around the country and are moving into the more remote and conflict-affected areas, though the many armed ethnic groups that reside there often resist police authority. The police force has created specific units to tackle many forms of transnational crime and has expanded the number of women within the force.","text - economic and financial environment":"Despite Myanmar\u2019s implementation of measures to curb money laundering in collaboration with international partners, the country is still highly vulnerable. Myanmar\u2019s economy and financial sector are underdeveloped, and the majority of their currency is held outside of the formal banking system. Despite a willingness to restrict money laundering, the institutions lack the knowledge and resources to be effective. The influence of military regimes in various illicit markets makes fighting money laundering more difficult, and Myanmar remains one of the highest-risk countries for money laundering and terrorist financing in the world. ##&& The government of Myanmar has instituted various reforms to attempt to strengthen the economy by establishing clear, transparent and consistent regulations alongside promoting agricultural productivity and attempting to modernize the financial sector. However, the economic environment still lacks clarity, and the enforcement of regulations has been inconsistent due to the leading role that the military plays in the economy. Myanmar is a very poor country and one of the hardest places to do business in the world, and the informal economy in the country is extremely large.","text - civil society and social protection":"Myanmar lacks the legislation needed to protect victims and witnesses of organized crime, and the government\u2019s approach is overtly punitive, especially in relation to sex trafficking victims and drug users. The country does however have constructive memorandums in place with Thailand to combat human trafficking and to launch procedures for repatriation. Myanmar was one of the slowest countries in South-eastern Asia to implement its national crime prevention strategy, finally doing so in 2019. The plan focuses on community-based crime prevention and rehabilitation programming as prevention strategies. Myanmar cooperates closely with the UNODC to improve both short- and medium-term access to food and income in rural villages, as well as to promote legal crop production as an alternative to opium cultivation. ##&& International NGOs are increasingly active in Myanmar, working on humanitarian responses in a multitude of sectors, and while most civil society groups focus on religion, poverty and health, some are moving in to take over the duties of the state where it is absent. Myanmar has a highly censored media environment and the government response is particularly aggressive when journalists cover the handling of the Rohingya Muslim crisis.

As many people live in remote and economically deprived areas in Nepal, they are particularly vulnerable to recruitment methods of traffickers. Domestically, victims are often subjected to bonded labour through the haliya and kamaiya systems, in which debts are created that victims cannot escape from. Government officials are known to systematically facilitate the practice of human trafficking and accept bribes. ##&& Although not quite as large as the trafficking market, human smuggling is still widespread in Nepal due to push factors such as poverty, high unemployment rates and political instability. Nepali human smugglers are part of well-connected and sophisticated criminal networks that spread across countries and continents to manage the movement of people.

Small arms are a problem and circulate throughout Nepal, often seized from local gangs or are found to have been used in various forms of criminal activity, including theft, extortion and homicide.","text - environment":"Around 25% of Nepal is covered by forest, which creates plenty of opportunity for flora crimes, the most common of which are illegal timber and fuelwood harvesting, infrastructure development and overgrazing. Timber smugglers are often Nepali nationals living near forests close to the border with India, while some flora products are also smuggled into China. Furthermore, Nepal is a transit and source country for illicit fauna products, predominantly rare and endangered species, usually feeding into the large Chinese market. Nepal nationals generally arrive in Kathmandu with poached wildlife to sell to racketeers, who eventually smuggle the contraband into foreign countries. Wildlife crime is driven by poverty, lack of conservation awareness and poor law enforcement of wildlife crimes. ##&& Nepal is a major transit route for gold, due to its proximity to China and India, both of which have large gold markets. As India in particular generates a high demand for gold (where it sells for high prices), smugglers look to bring gold in from China and smuggle it through Nepal into India. Migrant workers returning to Nepal are increasingly being lured into the illicit activity due to its higher wages. The market features notable levels of violence as rival criminal groups fight for profits.","text - drugs":"Cannabis is the largest drug market in Nepal, where locals receive seeds, money and fertilizers from India for its cultivation.

The trafficking and abuse of psychotropic substances is rising in Nepal, with large seizures of drugs such as diazepam being made every year. Nepal also remains a transit country for cocaine, and while it is not used or sold locally, trafficking to China, India, Thailand and other East Asian countries is increasing.

Nepal\u2019s drug trafficking market is characterized by many small groups vying for a greater market share but with no group holding any sort of monopoly. Gangs are often active in development initiatives, including national and district-level infrastructure construction contracts. Nepali human smugglers have been apprehended in Malaysia and routinely run extortion campaigns. While such groups have not entirely penetrated law enforcement, they do receive cooperation and protection from certain members of the authorities to conduct their smuggling operations. ##&& Criminal networks are especially involved in fauna crimes and work with individual Nepali hunters and poachers; middlemen who arrange the transport of the wildlife; and high-level Chinese and Indian brokers who manage operations, often out of Kathmandu. All levels of the state are heavily involved in corruption and are entwined with criminal groups. The political instability within Nepal has led to a severe lack of accountability and provided ideal conditions for all manner of corrupt practices, including financial crime and bribery from gold smugglers.

The only area where the government has shown leadership is in tackling wildlife crime, being the first country to have brought down poaching to all its flagship species \u2013 elephants, rhinos and tigers, to zero. Corruption is rife, and Nepali political institutions are still mired in historical patronage networks that function through bribery, embezzlements and payments of baksheesh. Although Nepal boast an inclusive anti-corruption legal framework, its implementation is poor. While there are transparency measures in place, such as the right to access information, the mechanisms are poorly defined and inconsistently enforced. ##&& Overall, Nepal\u2019s international cooperation is adequate. The country is particularly involved in fighting illegal wildlife trade, especially with China and India. As an important source country for human trafficking and smuggling, Nepal relies heavily on, and is engaged substantially in, international cooperation in these matters. However, Nepal has failed to ratify treaties around the arms trade, and while it is often a participant in international cooperation, its enforcement measures are frequently lacking. Additionally, because of the lack of transparency and rife corruption, foreign aid is often diverted from its perceived destination. Although Nepal has national laws and policies in place pertaining to most forms of organized crime, they are usually insufficient and ineffective. Nepal\u2019s legislation focuses largely on human trafficking, but even in this regard the legislation is not comprehensive. The Nepali government has made amendments to its legislation to try to bring it in line with international standards in recent years, but there is still much improvement to be made.

Furthermore, many Nepalis have only limited access to justice. Courts are under-resourced and face serious backlogs and a slow appeals process. Nevertheless, in 2015, the Supreme Court of Nepal did impeach a numberof political leaders on allegations of corruption and there has been a significant number of prosecutions for wildlife crimes. ##&& After the civil war, the authorities struggled to maintain law and order, notably in rural areas. The state apparatus was controlled by privileged groups prone to political manipulation and corruption. Corruption is rife among the lower levels of the police, especially near border areas, and public trust in the police is very low. Furthermore, police effectiveness is limited by a lack of resources and training. Although the Ministry of Home Affairs has created some bodies to combat certain types of organized crime, they have limited effectiveness and do not stretch to all forms of organized crime. However, Nepal\u2019s response to wildlife crime has been highly effective, in large part due to an effective law enforcement response, namely by the wildlife crime control bureau. Nevertheless, this success is an exception, rather than the rule, in regard to effective policing. The long and porous border separating Nepal from India and China is difficult to police, has weak controls and is vulnerable to cross-border criminality, especially arms and drug trafficking. The Terai region which borders India is ideal for many criminal activities and is often used as a buffer province of India.

While improvements have been made in regard to financial inclusion and access to credit, contract enforcement is still very poor, and despite the regulatory efforts that have been made in recent years, business confidence remains very low in Nepal. ##&& Nepal is regarded as an ideal place for money laundering due to its lack of economic stability, weak interrogative system and an open border with high levels of informal transactions with India. Despite being among the most vulnerable countries in Southern Asia for money laundering, Nepal has made significant improvements in recent years due to the financial intelligence unit formally entering the Egmont Group and working more closely with banks and government departments. However, the improved institutional and legal frameworks around anti-money laundering legislation are weakened by the lack of detailed and digitized data held by banks, as well as a large informal economy and money transfer market. ","text - civil society and social protection":"While a number of measures have been implemented to support victims of organized crime, especially trafficking victims, significant gaps remain, such as inadequate funding for support centres for victims of human trafficking, and an overall lack of effectiveness. Nepal\u2019s witness protection legislation is sorely missing, which creates an environment where criminal groups can act with impunity. While Nepal was one of the first Asian countries to engage in drug harm reduction programmes, the rehabilitation services are privately operated and unaffordable to most people who use drugs, making them highly ineffective.The Nepali government\u2019s greatest achievement in the prevention of organized crime is in regard to the illegal wildlife trade, where the country boast great success. The importance placed on conservation, the creation of oversight bodies and the introduction of community-based anti-poaching units have been key to this success. However, while the country has been successful domestically, Nepal is still used as a transit point for the illegal wildlife trade and this has yet to be addressed. In so far as they exist, prevention measures with other forms of crime have been largely unsuccessful. Anti-trafficking committees lack the resources to be effective, and public awareness campaigns have not reached the most critical areas. The government has failed to ensure adequate labour inspections to root out exploitation, and has made minimal efforts to prevent child sex tourism. Drug use prevention methods have been limited to awareness campaigns in schools and have been ineffective. ##&& NGOs play an active role in Nepal, from natural disaster response to pressuring the government to introduce measures to tackle human trafficking, and have been particularly successful in forcing the government to recognize organized crime-related issues and to widen the debate around them. While NGOs and civil society groups are strong, the persistence of government corruption and institutional cronyism obstructs their efforts. Since 2008, Nepal\u2019s government has taken a decidedly more authoritarian approach to censorship and civil liberties. Independent radio and print outlets show a bias towards particular political parties and there are reports of intimidation. While the internet is not censored, the country criminalizes libel and defamation, which has caused many journalists to self-censor.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Kathmandu","GDP (current $US million)":"30641.38","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"28608710","Land Area (sq. km)":"147180","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"82.2","Freedom in the World Index":"56","Human Development Index":"0.6","Global Peace Index":"1.97","Democracy Index":"5.22","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"33","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1071","1":"6.17","1.1":"5.70","1.2":"6.63","2":"3.71"},{"Corresp":"131","ISO-3":"OMN","Country":"Oman","ISO-2":"OM","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Western Asia","Flag file":"om.png","1.

Finally, although isolated seizures of cocaine have been made in the country and cocaine is reportedly consumed in Oman, the cocaine market is not significant in scope and scale.","text - criminal actors":"A mixture of decentralized criminal networks, low-level state-embedded actors and foreign actors make up Oman\u2019s criminal ecosystem, but no mafia-style group is known to have a presence or influence in Oman. Criminal employment agencies and foreign actors are prevalent in the human trafficking trade. The human trafficking networks are seemingly diffused across the entire country and extend beyond Oman to connect with local agents in trafficking victims\u2019 countries of origin. Low-level state-embedded actors in Oman\u2019s criminal markets seem to be corrupt and complicit law enforcement officials, security personnel and airport officials who allow traffickers to move people into the country through legal access points. ##&& Additionally, due to its geographical position within the Gulf, there is a small smuggling community in places such as Musandam, the northernmost exclave of Oman, that caters to the Iranian contraband market. Some government officials are believed to be complicit in or tolerant of these operations. The organizations using Omani territory for drugs transhipment are believed to be mostly of foreign origin, though they may work with Omani nationals and potentially, low-level state-embedded actors.","text - leadership and governance":"Oman is a sultanate, and the decision-making process is largely subordinate to the sultan's executive prerogatives. Oman\u2019s leadership has not taken a specific stance on organized crime, which is not part of the political discourse. While the country has embarked on an anti-graft drive, there are still many conflicts of interest in the government and the boards of state-owned companies, and petty corruption in law enforcement agencies. This hinders effective responses to organized crime. ##&& Oman has acceded to the UNTOC and the Palermo Protocols, the UNCAC, the Arab Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and most other relevant treaties. Though it is not a signatory of the Arms Trade Treaty, Oman has sought to implement the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its aspects. Oman cooperates with international partners on a range of areas, including with the US and the UK on maritime issues and a number of African countries on countering human trafficking. A member of INTERPOL since 1972, Oman hosts a National Central Bureau. Domestically, it has a comprehensive legal framework for combating organized crime, with a penal code that criminalizes organized crime as an enterprise, different criminal activities and membership of a criminal organization.","text - criminal justice and security":"Oman\u2019s judicial and court system is perceived as impartial, independent and relatively free of corruption. While there are concerns around transparency, there is no evidence to suggest that organized crime is able to influence the judicial process. Although the conditions in Oman's prison system generally meet international standards, allegations of abuse and life-threatening conditions have been reported. ##&& Oman\u2019s territorial integrity is largely sound. There is some debate, however, about the state of its border with Yemen, and the south-western hinterlands, where there are alleged Iranian efforts to smuggle weapons to the Houthis. Iran has reportedly accomplished this through developing ties to locals in Oman's Dhofar region. Whether this is due to a genuine lack of capacity to control its territory or a political gambit to ensure that its interests are preserved remains ambiguous. The primary law enforcement entity in Oman is the Royal Oman Police. While there is corruption within the police, police and the wider security sector cannot engage in corruption with impunity, and generally appear to be under effective oversight. There are no reasons to believe that the Omani security sector lacks the capacity or trust to respond adequately to the threat of organized crime.","text - economic and financial environment":"The economy of Oman is under increasing pressure, due to a combination of business shutdowns and the oil-price contraction resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The rising unemployment rate has pushed workers in Oman, in particular foreign workers, into increasingly precarious situations, making them more vulnerable to exploitative practices. More generally, restrictive labour regulations and lack of transparency in public procurement are major impediments for private sector development in the country. ##&& Nevertheless, money-laundering risks are relatively low and Oman's 2016 anti-money laundering law, which created the National Centre for Financial Information, has strengthened the country\u2019s anti-money laundering efforts and has significantly helped in countering the financing of terrorism regime. Thus, the strategic deficiencies in Oman\u2019s AML\/CFT are relatively minor. This notwithstanding, Oman continues to be vulnerable to corrupt dirty-money flows from Yemen.","text - civil society and social protection":"Efforts to assist victims of crime, predominantly of human trafficking, take the form of the provision of shelters that provide psychological, legal and medical facilities, as well as the development of anti-trafficking capabilities by the police. Nevertheless, Oman remains behind the curve due to various structural impediments, such as continued reliance on victims of trafficking to self-identify (with a high risk of negative consequences) and domestic workers not being subject to Omani labour laws. Regarding narcotics, Oman has set up a dozen rehabilitation centres across the country to attend to the needs of people who use drugs and has conducted national-awareness campaigns geared towards young people. On the whole, however, the country generally lacks crime-prevention initiatives and policies. ##&& The media environment in Oman is relatively restricted, and the government exercises heavy censorship on both traditional media and the internet. Journalists have been arrested and charged with insulting the head of state, creating a climate that makes it difficult for the media to raise issues such as corruption and organized crime. Likewise, the space for civil society is limited and, while there are a few NGOs working in areas such as human trafficking, their efficiency is often impeded by an opaque bureaucratic system.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Muscat","GDP (current $US million)":"76331.52","Income group":"High income","Population":"4974986","Land Area (sq. km)":"309500","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"50.4","Freedom in the World Index":"23","Human Development Index":"0.81","Global Peace Index":"1.94","Democracy Index":"3.00","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"54","GDP per capita (current US$)":"15343","1":"4.14","1.1":"4.90","1.2":"3.38","2":"5.25"},{"Corresp":"132","ISO-3":"PAK","Country":"Pakistan","ISO-2":"PK","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Southern Asia","Flag file":"pk.png","1.

Forced labour frequently occurs in the agricultural, construction, fisheries and textiles industries. While most cases of human trafficking are internal, Pakistanis have also been trafficked abroad and subjected to forced labour in the Middle East and Europe. Pakistani women and girls have also been trafficked into forced marriages in China, and Pakistani boys have fallen victim to the bachu bazi practice of sexual exploitation both domestically and in Europe. Children are also exploited in the domestic labour industry, as servants, in mines and as part of the drug trade. Refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs), migrants and marginalized minorities in Pakistan are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking, and victims are largely targeted through false advertising or the implementation of debt. ##&& Pakistan\u2019s human smuggling market is also flourishing, as many Pakistanis seek the services of smugglersin order to travel to Western countries. Moreover, refugees from other countries in Southern and South-eastern Asia but primarily from neighbouring states have been smuggled through Pakistan and onwards to other countries. The market is largely facilitated by corrupt government officials. Human smuggling is particularly prevalent in Balochistan province, driving the economy, and for some villages, serving as the largest source of revenue. Most human smuggling cases, both into and out of Pakistan, occur along the borderlands of Balochistan. However, individuals have also been smuggled along sea routes to neighbouring countries. Smuggled individuals are particularly vulnerable along theirjourneys, especially through Balochistan, where many have been subjected to violence and exploitation.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking is a significant issue in Pakistan. Illicit weapons are widely available and often trafficked out of Pakistan to neighbouring countries. More than three quarters of privately owned arms in Pakistan are unregistered. A lack of transparency surrounding legal arms exports also suggests the occurrence of illicit activity. One of the country\u2019s most significant arms hubs is in Darra Adam Khel, where low-quality weapons are produced for various purposes, providing easy access for criminals. Arms produced in Darra Adam Khel have also been used in instances of terrorism. On the other hand, high-quality weapons, destined for both domestic and foreign markets, are produced in Peshawar. However, insurgent groups most often acquire arms from battlefields or purchase illicit weapons from state forces and\/or arms traffickers. Overall, arms proliferation has resulted in increased rates of violence from organized criminal groups, insurgents and violent extremists across Pakistan. Due to increased efforts to contain domestic militancy and organized crime in recent years, Pakistan\u2019s arms trafficking market seems to be on the decline. Regardless, the market continues to pose a significant threat to the country\u2019s stability.","text - environment":"Environmental crimes are a significant issue in Pakistan. The country has enormous mineral wealth, particularly in the Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in Balochistan. In these regions, corrupt government officials facilitate the illicit trade of gems and other precious stones. Limited international investment due to both corruption and security issues also enables the illicit mining sector to flourish. Criminal groups have become increasingly involved in illicit mining activities, especially in areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa such as the Mardan or Kohistan districts. In Balochistan, high-value metals such as gold and copper have also become a source of conflict between miners, the local and central governments, and Baloch nationalists. In particular, conflict has erupted over the Reko Diq mine, one of the largest gold and copper mines in the world. Balochistan\u2019s coal industry also lacks regulation and is linked to corrupt and criminal interests. Although the Pakistani government has taken steps to attract legal mining operators, organized criminals wield significant control over mining activities in Pakistan. ##&& Illicit logging also occurs in Pakistan, and is engaged in by both organized criminals and domestic militant groups. A timber mafia also operates in both the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan forests, and is believed to harbour links to corrupt government officials. Illicit timber is often smuggled out of Pakistan to neighbouring countries and back into Pakistan for the purpose of tax evasion, and subsequently smuggled to the Middle East. Some illicit timber also fills local construction and heating demands. Illicit logging has had a detrimental environmental impact on Pakistan, rendering the country\u2019s deforestation rate one of the highest in Asia. However, the market is partially on the decline due to increased opposition from locals seeking to curb deforestation. ##&& Poaching also poses a threat to wildlife in Pakistan. The pangolin population in particular has declined by an estimated 80% in the last five years due to poaching. Karachi-based middlemen purchase pangolins from poachers and transport them to China for consumption or use in traditional medicine. Corrupt government officials and elite landlords also organize hunting trips for wealthy visitors to Pakistan from the Middle East. Illegal hunting trips pose a significant threat to the Houbara bustard, as clearances for hunting the birdare not always legally obtained. Thering-necked parrot also faces risks due to poaching. However, large organized criminal groups are not heavily involved in poaching. ","text - drugs":"Cannabis and heroin trafficking flourish in Pakistan. Cannabis consumption is widespread, especially in Karachi, which is believed to have the second-highest rate of cannabis consumption globally. In some parts of Pakistan, cannabis is also used for medicinal purposes or given to animals as treats. Pakistan also has one of the highest cannabis seizure rates globally. Cannabis production occurs primarily in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, supplying both domestic markets and markets across South Western Asia and the Middle East. Cannabis from neighbouring countries is also trafficked through Pakistan to the Middle East. Since many armed groups rely on the cannabis trade for income, cannabis fields have been targeted and burned in counter-insurgency operations. Heroin trafficked into Pakistan from neighbouring Afghanistan is primarily trafficked onwards to Southern Asia, as well as to East Africa or Southern Africa. Nearly half of Afghan-produced heroin transits through Pakistan. Consequently, easy access to heroin has led to rising rates of heroin addiction. Mafia-style groups and criminal networks, based primarily in Karachi, are heavily engaged in heroin trafficking, and cooperate with insurgent groups such as the Taliban. Corrupt government officials also facilitate heroin trafficking, enabling mafia-style groups that aid domestic and foreign policy goals to engage freely in the trade. Nevertheless, the government crackdown on domestic militancy and organized crime in recent years has led to the market\u2019s contraction. ##&& Pakistan\u2019s synthetic drug trade is also expanding, with methamphetamine consumption in particular becoming more popular among youth. Methamphetamine is trafficked into Pakistan from neighbouring countries, and to a lesser extent, from South-eastern Asia. K-tablets are also produced in Pakistan and trafficked to neighbouring countries. As with the heroin trade, the synthetic drug trade is primarily controlled by mafia-style groups. However, Pakistan\u2019s cocaine trade is negligent, anddue to high prices, the drug is only consumed by the elite. Nevertheless, heroin traffickers sell cocaine on the side.","text - criminal actors":"Both mafia-style groups and criminal networks engage in several forms of organized crime in Pakistan, including heroin trafficking, illicit mining, illicit logging and human smuggling. The most well-known mafia-style groups are the People\u2019s Aman Committee, D-Company and Altaf Khanani\u2019s money laundering organization. Designated terrorist groups such as the Taliban also engage in criminality as a source of revenue. Membership in mafia-style groups is high, especially in regions such as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Karachi, and many groups are linked to corrupt government officials or political parties. Boundaries between mafia-style groups, terrorist groups and political parties are thus often blurred. As such, mafia-style groups wield significant power over the democratic process and also influence the prison system. Because of that influence, there are gang-controlled areas, where the police is unable to enter. Mafia-style groups and criminal networks alike engage in activities such as racketeering, extortion and kidnapping. The latter are widespread across the country and are key to undermining the formal governance system as they have close ties to different state structures \u2212 law enforcement agencies, local customs\/taxation departments, etc. ##&& Corrupt government officials cooperate with both mafia-style groups and criminal networks that aid the country\u2019s domestic or foreign policy ambitions, including suppressing the Balochistan insurgency or opposing India. As such, state-embedded actors are involved in a range of criminal markets. Local criminals also cooperate with foreign criminals in transnational criminal markets such as heroin trafficking and human trafficking. Chinese criminal gangs are particularly active in human trafficking in Pakistan, and Baloch insurgents are believed to have multiple transnational links. Additionally, Afghani and Iranian drug traffickers play a considerable role in Pakistan\u2019s both domestic retail\/wholesale and exports drug markets. However, foreign actors exert moderate influence over organized criminal activity in Pakistan.    ","text - leadership and governance":"The Pakistani government exhibits strong authoritarian tendencies. The limited efforts to respond to organized crime are largely cosmetic, and are driven by political aims instead. In particular, the Pakistani government demonstrates tolerance towards anti-Indian criminal groups that align with its foreign policy objectives. Moreover, the judicial and security sectors are largely corrupt and lack political independence due to military influence. The failure of anti-corruption measures engenders high rates of impunity, and anti-corruption charges are often merely political attacks, hindering both rule of law and democracy. Government opposition, particularly in Balochistan and Kashmir, also hinders rule of law and drives up rates of violence. As such, Pakistan is one of the most fragile and corrupt states worldwide. However, the government is fairly transparent and access to information is guaranteed. ##&& Although Pakistan cooperates with international organizations such as INTERPOL, the country\u2019s international cooperation efforts against organized crime and violent extremism have been fraught with complications. In particular, due to hostility towards India, the Pakistani government has served as a spoiler in peace negotiations, and has also provided a safe haven for terrorists and criminals. However, the Pakistani government has signed most treaties related to organized crime, with the exception of the Arms Trade Treaty, and also has extradition treaties with numerous countries in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The Pakistani penal code addresses a number of forms of organized crime, including human trafficking, human smuggling and drug trafficking. Pakistan is also a large recipient of international aid, in particular from the US. ","text - criminal justice and security":"Pakistan\u2019s rule of law is extremely weak. Corruption and impunity run rampant, and there is little public trust in either the judicial or law enforcement systems. Moreover, criminal investigations lack adequate funding. The prison system also suffers from overcrowding, understaffing and lack of medical care, and relies more on a punitive than rehabilitative approach, as evidenced by the involvement of prison officials in the physical beating and mental torture of prisoners. Mafia-style groups also wield significant influence over the prison system, rendering radicalization and terrorist recruitment significant issues. However, specialized police and investigation agencies exist to counter organized crimes, particularly human and drug trafficking as well as money laundering. ##&& Pakistan\u2019s territorial integrity is also weak. The Pakistani government has, in some instances, outsourced border control to armed groups as part of its anti-terrorism response, despite these groups being accused of extrajudicial killings and torture. Armed clashes with government opposition groups in Balochistan also hinder state authority along the region\u2019s borderlands, where armed groups and state forces alike have been accused of human rights violations, and rates of violence and criminality have significantly increased. The Pakistani government\u2019s lack of territorial authority is also visible in the flourishing of criminal activity in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Karachi. Moreover, power struggles between civilian and military components of the state security apparatus weaken the efficacy of anti-organized crime and terrorism efforts. ","text - economic and financial environment":"Pakistan has one of the highest risks of money laundering and terrorist financing in the world. Although the Pakistani government has shown a limited amount of progress in recent years, largely due to international pressure, the pace of improvement has been slow, and the country continues to be monitored for money laundering and terrorist financing risks. This has had a negative impact on economic growth, rendering it extremely difficult to do business in the country, and also deterring foreign investors. In response, the government has adopted more conservative fiscal policies, prompting a slow rate of steady development. Although this resulted in rising rates of school enrolment and decreasing poverty, progress was hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than one third of the Pakistani population remains in poverty, with poverty being especially rife in Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Sindh provinces, as well as in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim support services are severely lacking in Pakistan. Law enforcement efforts to aid human trafficking victims are inadequate and inefficient. Pakistan is also one of the countries doing the least to aid victims to exit modern slavery in the Asia-Pacific region. Although drug rehabilitation centres exist and provide free services across the country, quality of care in these facilities remains low. Despite witness protection legislation being in place, enforcement remains limited and witnesses often disappear. This in turn hinders the ability to prosecute instances of organized crime. Crime prevention strategies in Pakistan are also lacking. Instead, state policy largely diverts criminals to membership in political militias or jihadist groups in which they can aid in domestic and foreign policy objectives. However, in recent years, the Pakistani government has increased its anti-terrorism efforts, in turn improving rates of crime prevention. ##&& Pakistani civil society is relatively active, and multiple NGOs, think tanks and civil society organizations work in the peace building and conflict prevention sectors in conflict-ridden regions of Pakistan. In particular, the national initiative against organized crime aims to increase national resilience and steer public policy on organized crime. Although Pakistani media has historically been quite vocal, media freedom has declined in recent years, and the systematic state targeting of independent journalists has risen. Journalists have been both harassed and killed due to investigative work on organized crime. As such, Pakistan has one of the lowest rates of media freedom worldwide.

Facebook is the main market for illegal wildlife trade. As with illegal logging, illegal wildlife trade in the Philippines is facilitated by weak law enforcement and corruption at seaports and airports. There are also illegal gold-mining operations in the Philippines, including in Mindanao, where there is significant transnational smuggling of gold due to corrupt state officials who rely on this criminal market to fund counter-insurgency operations and elections.

Sustained by the massive infrastructure projects that are part of the preparations for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the criminal market in Qatar is characterized predominantly by forced labour, although trafficking for sexual exploitation does exist as well. Victims are primarily recruited from countries in Southern, Eastern and South-eastern Asia as well as Africa, and often enter the country through recruitment agencies. As in other Gulf countries, the Kafala (sponsorship) system is present in Qatar. This system ties migrant workers to domestic sponsors, but it also increases vulnerability to modern slavery. Migrants pay exorbitant fees to recruiters and may become indebted, which often results in debt bondage, exploitation and abuse. Reportedly, recruitment agencies operate in victims\u2019 countries of origin, which implies a certain degree of collaboration between domestic and foreign actors. ##&& Given the high demand for foreign labour in Qatar, particularly in domestic work and other services, human smuggling is a significant issue in Qatar. Undoubtedly, however, human trafficking and smuggling overlap.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking in Qatar should be interpreted in the context of the state\u2019s foreign policy goals. Qatar purportedly maintains a policy of active support for a range of militant factions across the Middle East and North Africa region, the Horn of Africa and the Sahel, providing financial support and arms. Qatar is one of the leading arms importers in the world, subsequently exporting weapons to the regions listed above, essentially making arms trafficking a state-sponsored market. In addition, reports allege that Qatar has smuggled militants to Libya and aided Iran in smuggling weapons to separatists in Yemen.","text - environment":"Evidence suggests that a moderate market for illegal flora exists in Qatar, with reports suggesting illicit activities occurring both in the desert and the mangroves of the country. While Qatar is not a country of concern as far as fauna crimes go, both the country and the region remain a major hub for wildlife trafficking. Qatar Airways, the world's largest cargo carrier, is particularly vulnerable to being used by traffickers, transporting mostly ivory, rhino horn, reptiles and birds. Furthermore, there is a comparatively large demand for rare falcons and falcon eggs in Qatar, with source countries identified as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Mongolia. As most illegal wildlife trade is carried out through air routes, it is likely that the disruption to air travel as a result of COVID-19 would have negatively affected trafficking flows, at least to some extent. Some evidence exists that gold is illegally smuggled out of Qatar, mostly by foreign organized groups and migrant workers. The destination countries appear to be primarily India and Nepal.","text - drugs":"While there is no indication of significant domestic demand for heroin, Qatar appears to be a small-scale transit hub for the drug, smuggled via air, as well as through the Gulf from Iran. Similarly, small quantities of cocaine also transit the country, although these are likely to be isolated incidents as there is no information that Qatar is part of a particular cocaine trafficking route. Domestic demand is likewise relatively small. ##&& Qatar is a destination country for cannabis, although how much is trafficked into the country is uncertain. Known cases implicate criminal organizations originating in Southern Asia, India in particular. Groups allegedly send drug mules to Qatar, who deliver the drugs to Doha Airport. While most likely limited in scale, there is some demand for various synthetic drugs, including methamphetamine. Reportedly, organized crime groups from Southern Asia, and to a lesser extent, domestic ones, have been involved in the import and export of synthetic drugs, with homeward-bound migrant workers often used by groups to traffic synthetic drugs out of Qatar. The country is also identified as a hub in the methamphetamine and Captagon trafficking flows.","text - criminal actors":"Domestic criminal networks operate in Qatar and transnationally, and are mainly involved in gold smuggling, drugs and human trafficking. Due to the mainly transit role of Qatar, most organized crime activities tend to be concentrated at Doha and Hamad International Airports. Organized crime groups tend to be linked to Asia \u2013 India, Nepal and Bangladesh in particular. To facilitate their illegal activities, such groups often use corruption. State actors are, however, also directly involved in the trafficking of arms from Qatar to militia groups abroad. Notably, although state-facilitated arms trafficking does occur, motivation is political rather than financial. ##&& Foreign organized crime groups are active in trafficking drugs from countries of origin to Qatar. These hail mostly from Southern Asia. Foreign actors, either individuals or groups, are also allegedly involved in recruiting migrant workers in their countries of origin: Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Nepal, as well as various African countries. There is no information to indicate that mafia-style groups exist in Qatar.","text - leadership and governance":"Qatar is an authoritarian state, with the emir and his family maintaining control over state affairs and no elected legislature to offset executive power. Countering organized crime does not seem to feature strongly on the country's agenda, but allegations point to Qatar aiding separatist and terrorist groups abroad. Corruption perceptions in Qatar are low and officials have expressed a commitment to anti-corruption and integrity measures. There are anti-corruption bodies, but it is mostly low-level officials within the state apparatus who seem to be punished. Meanwhile, senior officials and members of the royal family are not held accountable for their allocation of state resources. This suggests that effective safeguards against corruption are lacking, despite the country\u2019s participation in a number of international anti-corruption initiatives. Transparency and openness in Qatar, or lack thereof, is also subject to criticism. Institutional budgets are partly shared with the public, while the budget of security ministries is completely exempt from oversight. ##&& Qatar is party to most international instruments pertaining to organized crime, with the exception of two of the protocols supplementing the UNTOC and the Arms Trade Treaty. Notably, however, reports point to Qatar\u2019s failure to fulfil its obligations on implementing the UNCAC. Nevertheless, Qatar is party to a number of agreements aimed at consolidating efforts in fighting transnational crime, terrorism and corruption. Increased cooperation between the US and Qatar is evident, especially in law enforcement and counterterrorism partnerships as well as in the increased information sharing between Qatari and US counterparts. In line with the country's international anti-organized crime commitments, Qatar\u2019s legislative framework covers the organized-crime activities that are of interest to this Index.","text - criminal justice and security":"There are no organized crime units within the Qatari judicial system. While the constitution guarantees an independent judiciary, the emir appoints judges, based on recommendations from the Supreme Judicial Council, and hold their positions at his discretion. Judges are appointed for three-year indefinitely renewable terms, with most being foreign nationals, which makes them particularly dependent on the government. While prisons meet international standards, cases of torture have been documented. Although Qatar possesses the financial resources to provide excellent training programmes to law enforcement officers, as well as state-of-the-art law enforcement equipment, recruitment possibilities among nationals are limited. Thus, foreign nationals are often hired to staff the police force. A specialized office for combating drug trafficking does exist within Qatari security structures as an independent body. As noted above, Qatari law enforcement benefits from various capacity-building programmes, a result of the deepening cooperation with US counterparts. The country is also an INTERPOL member state and hosts a National Central Bureau in Doha. Qatari maritime and land borders are not particularly vulnerable to organized crime networks, which most commonly use air routes. Since the 2017 diplomatic crisis, neighbouring countries have cut ties with Qatar, and Saudi Arabia permanently closed the Salwa border crossing, the only land border Qatar has. Qatar\u2019s border guards and coastguards operate an advanced integrated system that is able to monitor all Qatari borders. The system's main goal is to address terrorism, maritime piracy, smuggling and illegal fishing.","text - economic and financial environment":"According to Qatari representatives, a law was passed in 2019 that brought Qatar in line with international standards and recommendations on combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. There are two financial units: one is tasked with minimizing the risks of companies being used in money laundering activities; the other with obtaining, analyzing and distributing information on potential proceeds of crime, money laundering and terrorism financing activities. Despite the government\u2019s attempts to promote fair competition and privatization, the state still owns the country\u2019s major companies. Regulations around property ownership and starting a business are different for Qatari and non-Qatari nationals, although the latter are now able to own 100% of enterprises. Thus, improvements in the economic regulatory framework are required.","text - civil society and social protection":"Qatar has evidently stepped up victim support efforts in recent years. There centres for victims of trafficking as well as of domestic abuse that are run by the state, which provide basic medical and social care, along with psychological support, housing, repatriation assistance and reintegration. NGOs are active in victim support, running the daily operations of shelters. The government has also made use of the expertise of foreign NGOs, consulting them on best practice in managing trafficking shelters. Notably, the first trafficking-specific shelter in Qatar was set up in collaboration with civil society. Nevertheless, perhaps due to fear of disruption in the preparations for the 2022 World Cup, Qatar has for the most part neglected referred cases of forced labour and treated them as cases of wage theft. In terms of prevention, Qatar has a national strategy to combat human trafficking, with awareness raising among vulnerable groups as a key element of the strategy. Additionally, the government opened an International Labour Organization office in an attempt to strengthen its anti-trafficking capacities. Whistle-blowing has also been encouraged by the government in an effort to curb corruption, while Qatar is party to the Doha Declaration, committing member states to strengthening collective crime-prevention efforts and promoting the rule of law. Beyond human trafficking, however, there is little cooperation between NGOs and the government. Furthermore, all NGOs are not only closely monitored by the state but need permission in order to work in the country. There is no independent human rights organization in Qatar. The situation with the media sector is similar. Both print and broadcast outlets are censored and closely controlled by the state. Journalists in Qatar are threatened with jail sentences for defamation and tend to self-censor.","Number of pages":"3","Capital":"Doha","GDP (current $US million)":"175837.55","Income group":"High income","Population":"2832067","Land Area (sq. km)":"11490","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"44.1","Freedom in the World Index":"25","Human Development Index":"0.85","Global Peace Index":"1.62","Democracy Index":"3.24","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"63","GDP per capita (current US$)":"62088","1":"5.22","1.1":"5.80","1.2":"4.63","2":"5.58"},{"Corresp":"148","ISO-3":"SAU","Country":"Saudi Arabia","ISO-2":"SA","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Western Asia","Flag file":"sa.png","1.

The Kafala (sponsorship) system requires foreign workers to get an approval for exit visas from their employers, rendering them vulnerable to forced labour. The approximately 11 million migrant workers in Saudi Arabia are therefore most at risk of human trafficking. Moreover, vulnerable (often underage refugee) girls from conflict-affected countries such as Syria and Myanmar have increasingly been bought for \u2018temporary\u2019 marriages and other forms of prostitution. There have been reports of trafficking of child soldiers for the purpose of fighting on Saudi Arabia\u2019s side in the war in Yemen. Perpetrators of human trafficking include a myriad of actors, such as families, low-ranking officials, businesses and recruitment companies located within the country and abroad, in labour-sending countries. There are two main human trafficking hubs in Saudi Arabia: the country\u2019s northern border with Jordan and its southern border with Yemen. Many traffickers exploit the power vacuum along Saudi Arabia\u2019s southern border due to the ongoing conflict in neighbouring Yemen. ##&& In addition to being a destination country for human trafficking, Saudi Arabia is a destination market for significant numbers of irregular migrants travelling from the Horn of Africa through Yemen. This has created a sizable criminal market for criminal actors specializing in smuggling thousands of people on a monthly basis on the perilous journey from various destinations in the Horn of Africa towards Saudi Arabia. These networks are vast, stretching from Ethiopia to Saudi Arabia. Upon arrival in Saudi Arabia, many of these refugees and migrants are vulnerable to trafficking and many find themselves subject to forced labour and\/or sexual exploitation.","text - trade":"Saudi Arabia has a high prevalence of arms and is one of the largest firearms importers and defence spenders in the world. While the Saudi government often ships imported arms to Bahrain, Syrian and Yemen in violation of international law, massive corruption within the Saudi military facilitates the domestic arms market. Many such weapons are known to end up in the hands of violent extremist groups, including the Islamic State. Additionally, there are reports of growing criminal arms trafficking on the Saudi-Yemeni border.","text - environment":"Saudi Arabia plays an important role in various regional and global environmental criminal markets. A leading global oil exporter, Saudi Arabia is also a significant source country in the criminal oil smuggling market. Smuggling networks specializing in products such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel have increased in prominence in recent years. Such networks comprise gas station workers, distributors, drivers, smugglers in origin countries (and their partners in destination countries), distributors and small-scale vendors. For instance, fuel smuggling across the border between Saudi Arabia and Jordan has increased amid sharp increases in fuel prices in Jordan and occurs through official border crossings in some cases. In addition to smuggling in gasoline, diesel and oil, Saudi Arabia plays a key role as both a destination and transit country in global criminal markets for illicitly mined gold. While much of this illegally mined gold stays in Saudi Arabia, there have been several cases of gold being smuggled out of Saudi Arabia for destinations such as India and Bangladesh. ##&& The criminal market for wildlife in Saudi Arabia is also both large and growing. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has reported high rates of seizures of parrots originating in countries such as Cameroon and Pakistan, and the illegal sale of wild falcons in Saudi Arabia is reportedly increasing. Poaching inside Saudi Arabia remains a problem, and although the government has taken steps to strengthen conservation, it sometimes fails to fight illegal poaching. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is reportedly another issue in the country. Flora crimes are not widespread in Saudi Arabia, but illegal imports of agarwood are a known issue.","text - drugs":"Saudi Arabia is predominantly a destination country for synthetic drugs, heroin and possibly both a transit and destination country for cannabis. The consumption of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) allegedly accounted for the majority of admissions to Saudi rehabilitation clinics in recent years, and there is a strong possibility that ATS substances are the largest, and possibly expanding, criminal drug market in Saudi Arabia. Captagon, in particular, is making its way onto the Saudi market, and authorities have made large-scale seizures of the drug in recent years. Captagon pills are believed to originate in India and are transited via Egypt, entering Saudi Arabia via the Jordanian border. However, other ATS substances are believed to originate from other countries in the Middle East, including Syria and Lebanon. In addition to Captagon, Saudi Arabia has witnessed an increase in the trafficking of methamphetamine, which enters the country via Yemen, Jordan and Iraq, as well as the Dammam and Jeddah ports and airports. ##&& Saudi Arabia is also experiencing an increase in heroin trafficking in its territory, but it is difficult to determine whether this increase is due to domestic demand or because the country is somehow becoming a transit destination in a new, emerging heroin trafficking route. As indicated by seizures in recent years, heroin traffickers usually smuggle heroin into Saudi Arabia via its border with Jordan. Some older sources indicate that there is a domestic demand for heroin in Saudi Arabia, but the scale of this demand is unknown. Cannabis in Saudi Arabia is largely trafficked in by sea from Pakistan via the United Arab Emirates. Cannabis has not been a widely popular drug in Saudi Arabia, but reports indicate a dramatic increase in consumption in recent years, largely facilitated by corruption within the police force. The criminal market for cocaine is believed to be smaller in size than those for the three other drugs but seizures have been made, indicating some level of cocaine prevalence in the country.","text - criminal actors":"Criminal actors in Saudi Arabia consist mostly of criminal networks and state-embedded actors. While there are no traditional mafia groups with a sustained presence in Saudi Arabia, organizations with political (mostly Islamist) goals and mafia-like structures engage in organized criminal activity to finance their activities. Decentralized criminal networks operate in various criminal markets, including human smuggling and trafficking, environmental crimes and drug trafficking. In the human trafficking criminal market, these networks are spread across Saudi Arabia, although they are particularly concentrated at the borders, the coastline and within cities, where demand for (forced) labour is high. ##&& Transnational linkages exist between Saudi criminal networks and those in various source countries for human trafficking, especially neighbouring Yemen, as well as countries in East and West Africa, and Asia. Reportedly, criminal networks based around ethnic\/national groups, i.e. northern Nigerian, Chadian, Burmese, etc. operate in the country as well. Drug trafficking criminal networks are primarily linked to counterparts across the Middle East and in India. State-embedded actors have a sustained key role in a number of Saudi Arabia\u2019s criminal markets. There are persistent allegations against the royal family, who are said to engage in criminality with impunity. Corruption is also rife in the country, with reported instances of state figures\u2019 involvement in drug trafficking activity, in addition to multiple cases of grand corruption at the highest level of government. Moreover, petty corruption is likely to play some role in enabling most criminal markets.","text - leadership and governance":"Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy where ultimate authority rests with the ruling family. The country is ruled under Sharia law and citizens enjoy very few civil, political or religious liberties. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has taken a firm stance against the illicit drug market. At the same time, however, Saudi officials continue to deny the presence of organized crime actors in the country and generally refrain from addressing prominent issues such as human trafficking. While Saudi Arabia appears to perform comparatively well for its region in the fight against corruption on paper, there are very few mechanisms aimed at curbing corruption among the highest ranks of the political elite and the current anti-corruption crackdown is largely politically motivated. Abuse of power, nepotism and the use of middlemen (wasta) to do business remain commonplace, while the ruling family continue to exercise heavy control over oil funds with little transparency or accountability. Nevertheless, the kingdom\u2019s oversight and anti-corruption authority carried out mass arrests of both public and private sector individuals suspected of bribery, abuse of public funds and other forms of corrupt practices. ##&& Saudi Arabia has ratified UNTOC, the Palermo protocols and most other relevant treaties, with the exception of the Arms Trade Treaty. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has signed a number of bilateral agreements on extradition and migrant labour recruitment, but there is certainly scope for increased international cooperation. Domestically, Saudi Arabia\u2019s legal framework for combating organized crime covers all major criminal markets. However, there are worries that Saudi Arabia\u2019s legal framework, which is founded on Sharia law, makes it difficult for victims to come forward. Drug offences, for instance, are often met with capital punishment, while, in the past, sex trafficking victims have been punished for prostitution.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judiciary in Saudi Arabia, which is overseen by the Supreme Judicial Council, lacks independence and different judges can interpret Sharia at their discretion. Trials in Saudi Arabia often lack due process and the defendants\u2019 right to legal counsel is often ignored in practice and many have confessed to crimes under torture. However, since the beginning of 2020, all cases of human trafficking are to be referred to specialized criminal courts. The detention system in Saudi Arabia is notoriously secretive, and, as a result, there is little information on prison conditions. However, there are several reports of severe abuses taking place inside prison facilities, including torture and beatings. ##&& Saudi Arabia\u2019s borders are under constant pressure from Jordan in the north and Yemen in the south, exacerbated by the very sandy terrain that makes it difficult to police. As a result of regional developments and ongoing conflicts, Saudi Arabia is subject to several organized crime-related issues, namely through its porous borders, despite attempts to rectify this and improve surveillance technology in recent times. Law enforcement domestically is effective, and specialized organized crime units such as the general directorate of narcotics control are key to success. However, police officers are routinely accused of physical abuse, arbitrary detention is common and there is no independent police oversight body in the country.","text - economic and financial environment":"Overall, the business environment in Saudi Arabia is somewhat conducive to a dynamic private sector. The Crown Prince\u2019s \u2018Vision 2030\u2019 strategy seeks to diversify the country\u2019s economy and has led to a record number of economic reforms that have improved the business climate in the country. However, there remains nevertheless a fairly sizeable informal economy in the country, albeit no larger than other countries in the region. ##&& Money laundering and terrorist financing is a systemic vulnerability of Saudi Arabia. However, a comprehensive revisions of the legal and institutional AML\/CFT framework was passed recently, which has imposed severe penalties for money launderers, which, together with political considerations, has allowed the country to avoid a place on the EU\u2019s money laundering blacklist. Nevertheless, terrorism financing in particular remains a risk and Saudi Arabia continues to be a high-risk jurisdiction for money laundering and terrorist financing.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Saudi government has failed to develop a uniform instrument to aid the identification of victims of organized crime and refer them to proper support and protection. In the area of human trafficking, for instance, the government has created a number of mechanisms for protecting victims, but also frequently engages in arbitrary deportation policies and many trafficking victims are punished for acts that they were forced to commit. The government has also attempted to take a preventive approach to human trafficking by applying a domestic labour platform that seeks to eliminate unregulated employment brokers, but compliance remains in question. ##&& Most civil society organizations (CSOs) in Saudi Arabia are affiliated with the government and independent CSOs are subject to a restrictive legal framework. The kingdom adopted a new law on civil society in 2016 which, in theory, should make it easier to register as a CSO. However, organizations can be banned or lose their right to form if they violate Sharia or contradict public morality or national unity. In practice, therefore, an independent civil society does not exist in the kingdom. There exists no independent media in Saudi Arabia and repressive measures against journalists have intensified in recent years. Journalists tend to censor themselves because those who voice any criticism are liable to be prosecuted on charges of blasphemy, insulting religion and threatening national unity. Journalists have been killed for criticizing government policies in Saudi Arabia.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Riyadh","GDP (current $US million)":"792966.84","Income group":"High income","Population":"34268528","Land Area (sq. km)":"2149690","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"69.7","Freedom in the World Index":"7","Human Development Index":"0.85","Global Peace Index":"2.44","Democracy Index":"2.08","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"53","GDP per capita (current US$)":"23140","1":"6.02","1.1":"6.90","1.2":"5.13","2":"4.29"},{"Corresp":"153","ISO-3":"SGP","Country":"Singapore","ISO-2":"SG","Continent":"Asia","Region":"South-Eastern Asia","Flag file":"sg.png","1.

The economic fall out caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have made certain communities in the region more vulnerable to trafficking. ##&& Regarding human smuggling, Singapore has seen a decrease in cases as authorities have become better at detecting concealed individuals at land and sea checkpoints. However, at the same time, criminal organizations have developed more sophisticated methods of human smuggling, including the procurement of genuine and fraudulent travel documents.","text - trade":"The level of firearm and ammunition smuggling in Singapore is negligible as the country has one of the strictest gun-control laws in the world, a relatively small population, a high degree of public safety, and is insulated by neighbours where gun trafficking appears to be under control. However, as a thoroughfare for international shipping, it is highly likely that illicit consignments such as illegal arms pass through Singapore\u2019s maritime borders.","text - environment":"Singapore is a transit country for fauna crimes, including the illegal wildlife trade of birds, reptiles, ivory, rhino horn and pangolins. The country\u2019s geography is especially attractive for wildlife traffickers, given its vast coastline and surrounding waters, which are home to several endangered and rare marine species. In addition to being a transit hub, Singapore has been implicated in domestic ivory sales. However, this is expected to decline with a ban on domestic ivory sales that goes into effect in 2021. As for flora crimes, Singapore has a zero-tolerance approach to timber smuggling and there is no evidence to suggest that the already small illegal flora market has expanded in recent years. Similarly, there are no reports of non-renewable-resource crimes in Singapore, with the exception of a few isolated cases of gold smuggling into the country.","text - drugs":"The production and trafficking of methamphetamine in Singapore has increased in recent years, making it the most trafficked and consumed drug in the country. Cannabis is the second most used drug in the country, but the amounts seized and the number of users are very low compared to the rest of Asia. While Singapore is not a heroin producer, heroin trafficking is a problem in the country. At the same time, there has been a decline in the number of heroin users over the last few years. With regard to cocaine, there have been reports of increased trafficking in Singapore. However, the amount of cocaine seizures in recent years suggests that the market is relatively small.","text - criminal actors":"There are several loose networks of criminal associates engaging in illicit activities in Singapore. The most common of these engage in internet scams, unlicensed moneylending, operating illegal gambling dens and illegally importing cigarettes without paying duty. However, these groups do not pose a major threat to society and are closely monitored by the national police. There have also been reports of authorities dismantling several drug syndicates in the country, as well as organized criminal networks smuggling ivory from Mozambique. Although Singapore has a long history of secret societies, a police task force has mostly dismantled them, including two major ones that controlled the bulk of organized crime in the country. ##&& There are still criminal gangs in Singapore, but they are described as an unorganized network of street-corner gangs with no centralized leaders, making them less of a problem. There have also been reports of foreign members in Singapore\u2019s criminal gangs, mainly from neighbouring countries.

However, public perception of transparency in government decision making has fallen, potentially due to its COVID-19 response. Furthermore, although public data can be accessed online on government websites, there is no Freedom of Information Act in place in Singapore. With regard to international cooperation, Singapore participates in several bilateral extradition treaties and extradition arrangements.The country is also a signatory to international conventions and treaties targeting organized crime and illegal arms.","text - criminal justice and security":"The government has played a proactive role in reducing organized crime through a robust legal framework, effective law enforcement and strong legislation. The country\u2019s judges are independent and there is little evidence of corruption within the judiciary. Similarly, the police response to crime is considered effective and professional, in part due to mechanisms that investigate and punish abuse. In 2015 the country introduced a law to empower law-enforcement authorities to detect, investigate, prevent and disrupt organized criminal activities. Additionally, Singapore has one of the strictest drug-control laws globally and has one of the world\u2019s top execution ratesfor non-violent drug offences. For environmental crimes, Singapore applies a law that gives effect to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species to control the import and export of endangered species in Singapore. To address modern slavery in Singapore, the country introduced a law that criminalizes forced labour, and sex and labour trafficking. Despite all these factors, Singapore remains an attractive place for smugglers due to its expansive coastline, numerous islands and proximity to large illicit markets in the region. Because of this, the country is also active in securing its borders through the use of various technologies, including surveillance cameras along its coastline and biometric screenings at checkpoints.","text - economic and financial environment":"Singapore is one of the world\u2019s largest financial centres, with a highly developed free-market economy that is largely free of corruption, has stable prices, low unemployment and a high per-capita GDP.

Furthermore, individuals and companies involved in money laundering and terrorism financing now face stiffer penalties under a new bill passed in 2018.

On financial crimes, two best-practice papers were released to guard against the misuse of company structures for illicit purposes. The police force also offers an online platform called i-Witness, which allows individuals to report on criminal activity to the police. Despite these efforts, some concerns have been raised about the lack of consistent screening of trafficking indicators, especially during brothel raids. ##&& In terms of non-state actors, while the constitution provides freedom of speech and expression, the government imposes official restrictions on these rights and Singapore has one of the most oppressive media environments in the world. Companies linked to the government own almost all domestic media outlets, and most journalists practise self-censorship. Furthermore, recent legislation gives the government the power to force media outlets, including online platforms, to \u2018correct\u2019 any information they deem to be incorrect. Additionally, the country requires organizations of more than 10 people to register with the government who have full discretion to register or dissolve such groups.

The country is also a waypoint for Nepali women trafficked into the Middle East and subjected to labour exploitation there. Occasionally, European nationals have been accused of facilitating the trafficking of Sri Lankans to Europe via India; however, it may be the case that this is actually human smuggling as workers are able to return home, but may feel unable to because of incurred debt or financial predicaments. ##&& Sri Lanka is both a source and transit country for a sizeable human smuggling market. Sri Lankan female domestic workers are primarily smuggled to the Middle East, Italy and Cyprus, as well as South-eastern and Eastern Asia, through falsified job contracts and employment offers. Additionally, Sri Lanka acts as a key transit point for people smuggled from Africa and the Middle East with final destinations in South-eastern Asia or the Pacific region. Friends and families sometimes facilitate smuggling, and on occasion, agents or other contacts accompany smuggled people for part of the journey. Evidence suggests there has been a surge in irregular migration from Sri Lanka to Australia.","text - trade":"Sri Lanka hosts a significant arms trafficking market. While there is a demand for arms trafficking mostly driven by local demand from business people, politicians and their supporters, demand was much higher during the civil war. The current supply of illegal arms is not a result of significant inflows of illegal weapons into the country, but rather of war time weapons ending up in the hands of criminal networks. Arms trafficking is believed to occur primarily in Puttalam, Kalmunai in the Ampara district and Ikirigollewa in Medawachchiya, where locals allegedly smuggle arms while trading dried fish. Criminal gangs linked to arms trafficking operate in western Sri Lanka in Colombo and Budulla, and in southern Sri Lanka in Galle and Matara. Illegal arms manufacturing is believed to occur mostly in rural areas, primarily to produce small armsand T-56 ammunition.","text - environment":"Sri Lanka is predominantly a transit country for illegal wood from Africa to Asia. The tropical hardwood furniture market largely drives the illicit logging of rosewood and other rare hardwoods. Sri Lankais also a key transit point in fauna trafficking that occurs between Africa and Southern Asia or South-eastern Asia and the Pacific. In addition, the fishing and harvesting of sea cucumber as well as shark fins, driven by foreign demand, contributes to the illegal wildlife trade in the country. In regard to non-renewable resource crimes, Sri Lanka is primarily a transit country for illicit oil trade and gold smuggling. Much of the gold smuggling to India takes place via maritime routes, especially from northern Sri Lanka to India's Tamil Nadu province. Some smuggling of gold also occurs via commercial flights.","text - drugs":"Sri Lanka is a transit point for Afghan heroin transported by dhow to Mozambique. Additionally, as the Pakistan-India route is strictly monitored, heroin is smuggled through Sri Lanka into India. As Karachi, in Pakistan, is considered a high-risk point of origin, it is likely that heroin transported by ocean freight to Western Europe, and Rotterdam more specifically, is now shipped from Colombo instead. This reduces the probability of containers being searched, as Colombo is not consideredhigh-risk. Heroin is also the most widely used drug in the country and a large domestic heroin market exists. Sri Lanka is predominantly a transit country for cocaine, with the trafficking of liquid cocaine presenting a significant challenge to authorities. Notably, Sri Lankan police have reported increasing instances of criminal gangs masking cocaine shipments to Australia and Europe in Sri Lankan containers. The domestic cocaine trade is quite small as cocaine use is mostly limited to elite circles. ##&& The cannabis trade is one of Sri Lanka\u2019s larger criminal markets and the country is a source and transit point, with local production used mainly to satisfy domestic demand. This is characterized by a rising rate in youth consumption. Cultivation is mostly situated in dry zones in the southern and eastern provinces, with around 500 hectares of land used to grow cannabis. This is likely to have increased, especially since 2017, when floods in the southern part of the country damaged the tea industry, reportedly propelling many into cannabis cultivation in an attempt to offset financial difficulties. Sri Lanka also serves as a transit country for synthetic substances sourced from India, Pakistan and Afghanistan moving through Colombo and Mal\u00e9, in the Maldives, to richer economies. Overall, however, the illicit trade in synthetic drugs is smaller than other criminal markets in Sri Lanka. Although it is not a major manufacturer of synthetic drugs or precursor chemicals, the use of amphetamine-type stimulants and other synthetic drugs, is on the rise in Sri Lanka with local demand stemming primarily from the youth and the nightlife scene. It appears that some of the logistical infrastructure used for the maritime smuggling of heroin from Afghanistan and Pakistan is now also being used to transport meth.","text - criminal actors":"There are at least 30 known mafia-style groups active in Sri Lanka, including some that emerged from militant groups or political parties during the civil war, most notably the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) or Tamil Tigers. These mafia-style groups appear to be focusing their efforts on drug trafficking. At present, narco-political gangs operate primarily in the south and west of the country. However, most of them tend to maintain a much lower profile than the LTTE. Meanwhile, loose criminal networks present a significant problem across Sri Lanka and are mostly involved in drug trafficking. Although violence occurs due to gang rivalries, violence against civilians is rare. ##&& Transnational linkages with other international organized crime networks are known to exist, facilitated largely by maritime crime related to human and drug trafficking. These foreign actors wield some influence and financial power, and use the knowledge of local partners to evade detection along Sri Lanka\u2019s porous borders. As for state-embedded actors, they are believed to engage extensively in organized crime. There are widespread accusations of extortion, kidnappings, extrajudicial killings as well as recruitment of child soldiers. Allegations that corrupt law enforcement personnel sell firearms to mafia groups have also been made. Criminal network activities have allegedly been normalized due to corruption among police and politicians. It has been further suggested that the government has institutionalized criminality with the ruling elite allegedly exerting influence over every aspect of the economy, operating similar to a mafia structure.","text - leadership and governance":"Although organized crime is a significant issue in Sri Lanka, political rhetoric on the matter has rarely turned into legislation. Reports indicate that citizens\u2019 trust in the Sri Lankan government has decreased dramatically because of rampant corruption, a lack of transparency and accountability, as well as a lack of equal representation of certain groups. Additionally, many citizens fear government surveillance and harassment. Reports indicate that the government functions as a family enterprise; it is centralized and has little oversight. At the same time, Sri Lanka has taken several steps towards preventing and countering corruption through its national action and anti-corruption programs. Furthermore, since the end of the civil war, there have been efforts to seek accountability for war crimes, but these have now been abandoned. An independent anti-corruption agency was established to investigate allegations of bribery and corruption. Nevertheless, government efforts to address organized crime have generally taken a backseat. ##&& At an international level, Sri Lanka is a signatory to several anti-organized crime initiatives. However, the question of how active a member the country is, is debatable. Additionally, Sri Lanka participates in multiple regional initiatives targeting corruption and transnational crime. Sri Lanka also has bilateral extradition treaties in place, as well as a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty. At the national level, the country relies heavily on its penal code to convict human traffickers. The country has also implemented national hotlines and forest watch websites for locals and tourists to report environmental crimes.","text - criminal justice and security":"Corruption is rampant in Sri Lanka\u2019s judicial system, which is hampered by delays in prosecution, a lack of independent investigations, deficient victim and witness protection procedures and political interference, as well as evidence tampering, destruction and concealment. Moreover, public records are largely inaccurate and changes to the Constitution have limited judicial control over the president and other executive officials. Corruption extends to the country\u2019s prison system, which also faces severe overcrowding. It is also worth noting the country has reinstated the death penalty for those convicted of drug offences. In regard to law enforcement, high levels of corruption and bribery allow the police to act with impunity. Certain structural changes have also been made within the police to prevent them from investigating political and other crimes committed by the current prime minister while he was serving as president (2005 \u2212 2015). In recent years, community policing and bicycle patrol initiatives have aimed to increase police visibility and accessibility, while mobile units provide vital services to remote areas. As for territorial integrity, Sri Lanka\u2019s lack of infrastructure and effective border management render it susceptible to organized crime, particularly along maritime routes. Nevertheless, the navy has been proactive and successful in addressing maritime crimes.","text - economic and financial environment":"Despite its focus on post-war economic development and increasing rates of economic expansion, political and fiscal uncertainties have deterred investment in the country. Furthermore, the labour market in particular lacks efficiency, perpetuating imbalances between labour supply and demand across various sectors, while the judiciary is known to undermine property rights. Sri Lanka has anti-money laundering legislation in place, however, it lacks legislation to establish monitoring mechanisms over the finances of non-profit organizations, allowing for a possible money-laundering loophole. Nevertheless, efforts are being made to strengthen surveillance of suspicious transactions.","text - civil society and social protection":"Although Sri Lanka has established a national authority to protect crime victims and witnesses, the appointment to leadership positions of people allegedly involved in torture, has significantly harmed its legitimacy. Witness protection also seems to vary with each offence. In terms of drug abuse, Sri Lanka\u2019s prison system provides rehabilitation programmes and civil society organizations also support rehabilitation measures, in addition to campaigning for better victim and witness support measures. Civil society has also been key in promoting peace and sustainable development. Despite this, the CSO sector in Sri Lanka reportedly lacks coordination. The Sri Lankan government has also put in place multiple national and regional strategies to prevent crime, but most are generic and are not directed at organized crime. In addition, the government introduced numerous community awareness programs for organized crime in the hope of influencing behavioural change and reducing participation among vulnerable populations. With regard to the country\u2019s media environment, press freedom is extremely limited as evidenced by a surge in the police harassment of journalists. Discrimination and violence targeting ethnic minorities appear to be tolerated by the government and religious freedom is reportedly minimal.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Colombo\/Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte","GDP (current $US million)":"84008.78","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"21803000","Land Area (sq. km)":"65610","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"80.5","Freedom in the World Index":"56","Human Development Index":"0.78","Global Peace Index":"2.00","Democracy Index":"6.14","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"38","GDP per capita (current US$)":"3853","1":"4.64","1.1":"4.65","1.2":"4.63","2":"4.04"},{"Corresp":"169","ISO-3":"SYR","Country":"Syria","ISO-2":"SY","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Western Asia","Flag file":"sy.png","1.

Forced labour and sexual exploitation are pervasive in the country with women, men and children being victimized; many women in particular are forced into prostitution. Organ trafficking is also known to occur. State and non-state actors alike have also exploited Syrian children in combat, forcing them to participate as combatants, human shields, suicide bombers or executioners. Syrian and foreign victims have been trafficked out of Syria and exploited in neighbouring countries. The market is extremely lucrative, and is reportedly expanding. State inaction and facilitation of human trafficking exacerbates the Syrian population\u2019s vulnerability to exploitation. Although human trafficking occurs across the country, Deir ez-Zor and Al Qaim have been identified as major trafficking hubs. ##&& Millions of Syrians seeking to escape the civil war have been smuggled to neighbouring countries in recent years. Syrian smugglers cooperate with foreign counterparts in neighbouring countries to transport both asylum seekers and refugees. It is difficult to distinguish between the human-smuggling and human-trafficking markets, as smuggled individuals have faced considerable dangers on smuggling routes, especially when ISIS maintained a stronger presence in the region, and have also been exploited once abroad. As a result, many Syrians have paid smugglers to transport them back into Syria. Due to the elimination of ISIS in north-eastern Syria and the Syrian regime\u2019s re-consolidation of most territory, the market has contracted in recent years. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the vulnerability of asylum seekers and refugees to exploitation.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking has been surging in Syria since the outbreak of the civil war. Many foreign weapons intended for delivery to either pro-regime or opposition groups have been diverted to the black market. Many weapons intended for delivery to opposition groups have also been diverted to terrorist groups such as ISIS. Weapons are illicitly sold both online and in open-air markets, especially in north-eastern Syria. Regime weapons stockpiles have also been continuously raided and looted throughout the war, and Syrian Army officials are known to make illicit sales of both weapons and ammunition to opposition groups such as the Free Syrian Army. Syria\u2019s arms-trafficking market is primarily controlled by pro-regime groups, both foreign and domestic, and is particularly prevalent in southern Syria and in Kurdish regions, generating billions of dollars annually.","text - environment":"Oil trafficking is a significant issue in Syria. Throughout much of the civil war, Syrian oil was controlled by ISIS, and constituted an important source of revenue for the terrorist group. ISIS sold oil to both pro-regime and opposition groups, at its peak generating millions of dollars daily. Regime-subsidized fuel has also been diverted to black markets, and both criminals and warlords have engaged in fuel smuggling. High-ranking Syrian officials have been implicated in the illicit oil trade, and illicit fuel profits have played a crucial role in sustaining the Syrian economy throughout the war. High-level Turkish officials have also been accused of illicitly purchasing and transporting Syrian oil from ISIS, although this remains disputed. Since the elimination of ISIS in north-eastern Syria, Syrian oil has fallen into the hands of US-backed Kurdish forces, raising questions as to the extent of US involvement in the Syrian oil industry. Due to US sanctions on Iran, Iranian oil is also smuggled into Syria. ##&& Although wildlife crimes are less pervasive, wildlife and pets have been smuggled into Syria from neighbouring countries and Eastern Europe, and subsequently exported with fraudulent permits. There are also wildlife breeding centres in Aleppo and Damascus, from which exotic animals are smuggled out of Syria to elsewhere in the Middle East. The illicit bird trade is a significant issue, and notably threatens falcon species, such as shaheen falcons. Poachers also target the Eurasian blackcap as a black-market food delicacy. Moreover, sheep have been trafficked to neighbouring countries with drugs hidden in their wool, especially out of southern Syria and the eastern Euphrates region. Although gold smuggling also occurs, most other environmental crimes, including the flora trade, are limited or non-existent.","text - drugs":"Syria\u2019s cannabis and synthetic-drug trades are flourishing. Cannabis consumption is widespread among youth, and many Syrians have turned to cannabis cultivation as a means of survival amidst rising rates of poverty and unemployment, especially in north-eastern Syria. Cannabis is also smuggled into Syria from neighbouring countries, often with the aid of foreign groups such as Hezbollah, which also aids in local cannabis cultivation in Syria and promotes cannabis use among Syrian youth. Corrupt regime and military officials also facilitate cannabis distribution, and the market is controlled by a mafia-like network of domestic and foreign actors. Synthetic drug consumption is also on the rise in Syria, and prescription drugs such as Tramadol have been increasingly used by Syrian youth. Captagon consumption has also been exacerbated by the civil war, as it has been used by all warring parties to enhance fighting capabilities. Synthetic drugs are also smuggled out of Syria to neighbouring countries and elsewhere in the Middle East, as well as to Europe. Easy access to ingredients enables synthetic-drug production to flourish, and Captagon production in particular has been increasing in recent years. Corrupt regime officials also facilitate the synthetic-drug trade, and the triple border between Syria, Jordan and Iraq is known to be a synthetic-drug-smuggling hub. ##&& Syria\u2019s heroin and cocaine trades are far less pervasive. However, heroin from neighbouring countries and Central Asia transits through Syria and onwards to other countries in the Middle East or Europe, primarily via Damascus, Aleppo and Syria\u2019s north-western coast. Cocaine also transits through Syria to elsewhere in the Middle East. Hezbollah is involved in both heroin and cocaine smuggling in Syria, and sells drugs to corrupt regime-affiliated actors involved in distribution. The port cities of Tartous and Latakia are major drug-trafficking hubs.","text - criminal actors":"Corruption, bribery and nepotism also run rampant in Syria. State-embedded actors engage in various criminal markets, especially drug-trafficking markets, and regime-affiliated groups such as the National Defence Forces (NDF), Tiger Forces, Country Armor Forces and Ghaith Forces exert significant control over transnational criminal markets. State-embedded actors also provide criminal groups with weapons and security, preventing their entry into prisons and facilitating their transit through checkpoints. Some state-embedded criminal networks such as the Shabiha Forces and the NDF are known to employ mafia-style tactics, and are involved in a wide range of criminal markets, especially in regime-held territory. In recent years, the Castle Company has emerged as one of the Syria\u2019s main mafia-style groups, operating primarily in regime-held territory formerly controlled by opposition groups. The Castle Company has significant ties to foreign criminal groups. ##&& Many other criminal networks also operate in Syria, including paramilitary groups, tribal militias and family businesses that engage in crime and violence. Whereas large criminal groups tend to be more violent and engage in various criminal markets, small criminal groups tend to operate at a local level and engage primarily in kidnapping and extortion. Syria\u2019s largest and most violent criminal networks tend to operate along the country\u2019s borders, cooperating with foreign counterparts in neighbouring countries and across the Middle East. Foreign criminal groups also exert significant influence over Syria\u2019s criminal markets. Hezbollah is the most active foreign group engaged in organized criminal activity in Syria, and plays a significant role in drug-trafficking markets. Foreign criminal groups also cooperate extensively with local criminals, especially south of Damascus. Various foreign proxy groups involved in the civil war also control border crossings, real-estate markets and human-trafficking operations, and are also suspected of involvement in oil trafficking. Nevertheless, most criminal markets in Syria remain under the control of state-embedded actors.","text - leadership and governance":"Syria is one of the most fragile, vulnerable and corrupt states in the world. The Syrian regime is highly centralized and restricts all forms of dissent. Social, economic and military interests revolve around personal loyalty to the Syrian president, and positions in the state apparatus are often awarded to relatives of the ruling family or to pro-regime Iranian actors. State intelligence agencies observe the daily lives of citizens in efforts to root out dissent through targeted detentions, torture and executions. The Syrian regime has not made sufficient effort to combat organized crime, even after the end of ISIS in north-eastern Syria. Instead, since the outbreak of the civil war the regime has remained focused on re-consolidating territory and returning basic services to its citizens. State-embedded actors and pro-regime criminal groups also engage in various forms of organized crime. Corruption is a systemic issue and affects the entire state apparatus, rendering Syria\u2019s rule of law one of the weakest worldwide. ##&& Syria has ratified most treaties relevant to organized crime, and is party to the UNCAC. The country\u2019s legislative framework addresses various types of organized crime, including human smuggling and trafficking of human beings. Nevertheless, anti-organized-crime and anti-corruption efforts are severely lacking, and law-enforcement efforts and capacity remain limited. Rampant impunity for state-embedded actors also hinders rule of law. The Syrian regime has also failed to engage in international collaboration to combat organized crime, and has taken advantage of attempts at collaboration to instead blackmail international partners and advance its political goals. Syria also fails to extradite war criminals, even though extradition treaties are in place.","text - criminal justice and security":"The Syrian judiciary is extremely corrupt and lacks political independence. Judicial officials also lack proper legal training, and are required to be members of the ruling Ba\u2019ath Party. Law-enforcement entities are equally corrupt, lack political independence and are infiltrated by elements of organized crime. Corruption among police is exacerbated by low public salaries. The Syrian military also carries out arbitrary arrests of citizens. There is very little public trust in either the Syrian police or other state security groups. The state security apparatus has also suffered due to the civil war and lacks the necessary capacity to effectively combat organized crime. ##&& Syria\u2019s territorial integrity is extremely weak, and the regime lacks the capacity and infrastructure to control its borders. However, the Syrian regime is now in control of nearly three-quarters of the country\u2019s territory, primarily in central, southern and coastal areas. Since the elimination of ISIS, north-western Syria has been controlled by US-backed Kurdish forces seeking autonomy from Syria. North-western Idlib continues to be controlled by various opposition and jihadi groups. Syria\u2019s northern borders are secured only from the Turkish side, but not internally, and the Turkish government has taken control of a swathe of territory along the Syrian\u2013Turkish frontier. Syria\u2019s eastern borders are controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces, with the exception of the al-Waleed Crossing, which is controlled by Iranian actors and Hezbollah, along with the Syrian\u2013Lebanese and Syrian\u2013Jordanian borders. Low territorial integrity enables cross-border criminal activity to flourish. Syria\u2019s southern borders in particular are known smuggling hotspots.","text - economic and financial environment":"Syria has an extremely high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing, and legitimate economic activity has dwindled since the outbreak of the civil war. Although the country has strict legislation against money laundering, implementation remains limited. Pro-regime and pro-Iranian actors in particular enjoy impunity from financial-related offences. The Syrian Central Bank has also been complicit in money-laundering schemes. Syria\u2019s economy has been severely damaged due to the war, and most businessmen, economists and companies have moved to neighbouring countries. Foreign investment is also limited. As Iranian and pro-Iranian actors exert considerable control over the country\u2019s businesses, imports and exports, the economy has further suffered from sanctions on Iran. Some state-embedded actors control minor businesses, although these are also monitored by Iranian intelligence. As such, doing business in Syria is extremely difficult. ##&& The crumbling state of Syria\u2019s economy resulted in the emergence of a black market for money exchange and transfers offering better rates than the Syrian Central Bank. The regime has arrested hundreds of individuals involved in the black-market trade. Since January 2020, the value of the Syrian pound has plummeted, and it reached record lows following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, inflation and the cost of basic goods in Syria are soaring, and the country relies heavily on emergency shipments of basic commodities from foreign allies. Over three-quarters of the national population live in poverty, and this has only been exacerbated by the pandemic.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim protection is extremely weak in Syria. Courts discriminate against women in particular, and perpetrators of sexual abuse can avoid punishment by marrying their victims. Women are also afraid to report sexual abuse to the police for fear of further sexual abuse. While a limited number of civil-society organizations seek to protect women, especially victims of sexual abuse, their role remains limited, and they are severely underfinanced. However, the Syrian regime has introduced stricter laws against sexual abuse in recent years. Two state-run drug-rehabilitation centres also exist, as do a few private centres. However, Syria lacks a witness-protection programme, and judges may oblige witnesses to appear in court without protection. Crime prevention in Syria revolves around community awareness-raising programmes, often targeted at youth. The Syrian regime also has plans to establish crime-reporting centres. Community-based initiatives led by non-governmental organizations to promote civil-society awareness have also been launched, although they have been largely ineffective. Moreover, various crime-prevention programmes supported by international aid organizations have been mostly unsuccessful at reducing crime. ##&& The Syrian media is owned and controlled by state actors, and investigative journalism is nearly non-existent. Journalists engage in self-censorship, especially on matters regarding the ruling family or the Alawite sect. Journalists are also under constant threat of abduction and death, and have often been subjected to intimidation.

The cotton harvest is crucial for the economy, and victims are trafficked primarily from Afghanistan and Bangladesh and forced to work the harvest without pay. Tajikistan nationals generally only manage the trafficking of victims into Tajikistan, while criminal actors in bordering countries manage the movement of Tajiks out of the country. Corrupt government officials continue to assist traffickers with impunity. ##&& ##&& Due to the Commonwealth of Independent States agreements, it is relatively easy for Tajik citizens to migrate legally to Russia for work, meaning there is little need for Tajiks to employ smugglers.

Although the activity has contributed to the depletion of the country\u2019s forests, the practice has declined by almost 90% over the past two decades, largely due to the increasing availability of alternative energy sources. Regarding fauna crimes, Tajikistan is a waypoint, and to a lesser extent a country of origin, for illegal wildlife products. Criminal actors are traditional hunters and poach in remote areas, primarily because of the lack of legal employment opportunities. Until recently, hunting and poaching was legal and socially acceptable throughout the country, but hunters have begun to create community-based conservancies to protect endangered wildlife. There are now reasons to believe the fauna crimes market is shrinking, with a revival in the numbers of protected species. ##&& Tajikistan is rich in natural resources, particularly large deposits of silver, aluminium and coal. The mining of aluminium is crucial to the economy, and extraction is predominantly carried out by a state-controlled company, Talco. It generates more than a third of Tajikistan\u2019s GDP, but is highly corrupted and has been used as a slush fund for the president and his leading government officials. The main criminal actors in the natural-resource market are state-embedded actors, who can ensure a lack of proper oversight and regulation in the market.

Despite Tajikistan having the highest volume of seizures of opiates regionally, there are high levels of collusion between drug traffickers and the state, and increasingly local law enforcement is prevented from seizing vast amounts of heroin. State actors collude with domestic actors, usually Tajik warlords who have remained active since the civil war, and foreign actors, usually from Central or Western Asian countries. ##&& Similarly, Tajikistan is a significant transit country for cannabis due to its proximity to Afghanistan, a major cannabis-producing country. Substantial amounts of cannabis are trafficked together with heroin and opium through Tajikistan, suggesting that the criminal actors work across both markets, with mafia-style groups collaborating with state actors. Tajikistan\u2019s synthetic drug market is fairly limited, with most synthetic drugs entering the country from Russia and to a lesser extent, European countries such as Germany. While Tajikistan\u2019s local market is small, there are signs that it is growing, with the criminal actors being generally Tajik, though some Afghan and Russian nationals have also been implicated. The cocaine market, on the other hand, is negligible.","text - criminal actors":"There are several mafia-style groups operating within Tajikistan. Mafia control is predominant along the borders and in particular in criminal enclaves where they are embedded in the community, exerting some control over daily life. The groups are for the most part involved in drug trafficking and have forged links with state actors, sometimes even being integrated into the state administration. Tajikistan also has criminal networks often loosely connected with the ethnic clans that existed and emerged out of particular civil war factions. These clans and networks mainly compete for shares of the drug market, often combining trafficking with legitimate business, such as car exports. Most of the violence perpetrated by these gangs takes place along the borders and in neighbouring countries, rather than in Tajikistan itself. ##&& There is widespread corruption and collusion with criminal groups at all levels of government, especially in relation to drug trafficking, where high-level officials earn some of the revenues of the trade by facilitating its smooth running, using sanctions, non-prosecution and direct involvement. After the civil war, President Emomali Rahmon acquired much of the drug trade by replacing officials in anti-trafficking units with loyalists, and by using law enforcement to affect seizures of non-state-backed drug traffickers, to monopolize the market. Drug trafficking has become one of the country\u2019s largest income-generating streams and is vital to its functioning. Foreign actors also engage in the drug trade, the most prominent of which is the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, Islamic State groups, and Russian, Chechen and Afghan groups. ","text - leadership and governance":"Tajikistan is a one-party state; political opponents face severe intimidation and extensive smear campaigns executed by state media. The Tajik government does not communicate a strong position against organized crime, and this is likely due to its intimate involvement in the criminal drug trafficking market. There is a serious lack of government transparency and accountability, especially concerning the lack of independent oversight mechanisms against corruption. In fact, the government\u2019s anti-corruption unit is headed by one of the president's sons and is perceived by the public as one of the country\u2019s most corrupt institutions. It is woefully understaffed and under resourced and has no legal obligation to make its audit reports available to the public. Despite citizens\u2019 right to request government information and records, the legal framework underpinning access is poor, and the system is highly unreliable. ##&& Despite formal participation in international treaties and the presence of multilateral organizations in the country, Tajikistan\u2019s cooperation appears to be nominal. Having signed many treaties pertaining to corruption, human trafficking and smuggling, and drug trafficking, Tajikistan\u2019s government appears reticent to engage properly with international partners, and the treaties have been ineffectively enforced, resulting in no significant changes. The story is similar with Tajikistan\u2019s national policies and laws. Many specific areas of organized crime have been criminalized under domestic legislation, such as drug trafficking, corruption and money laundering, among others, but the legal framework underpinning the policies is deficient and ineffectively utilized. ","text - criminal justice and security":"Though the judiciary is technically independent under a separation of powers, it is effectively subordinate to, and controlled by, the executive branch. Checks and balances are ineffective, transparency in the judiciary is virtually non-existent and the president holds both formal and informal power over the courts, demonstrated by the courts\u2019 consistent rulings against opposition figures and dissidents. Tajikistan also holds political prisoners within its prison system, where conditions are extremely poor, prisoners are tortured and denied basic needs, and violence is rife. Bribery is common among guards and prisons function as recruitment grounds for organized crime groups. ##&& Tajikistan has few law enforcement units focused specifically on combating organized crime, and the institutions it does have, such as the Drug Control Agency, have had their own serious problems with corruption. Public trust in law enforcement is extremely low, with corruption and bribery a daily occurrence in dealings with law enforcement, while arrests appear to be politically motivated rather than focused on battling organized crime. Tajikistan is vulnerable to the spillover of Afghanistan\u2019s organized criminal networks, especially with regard to heroin and opium, where its location makes it an important transit country for Afghan opiates destined for Europe and Russia. Tajikistan is also vulnerable to the radicalized Islamist groups in neighbouring Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Pakistan. The military\u2019s border force protects the borders, but due to a lack of resources and training, they rely on the presence of the Russian military, and have sustained fatalities at the hands of radicalized Islamist groups. Criminal groups have substantial control along the borders, especially with Kyrgyzstan and in the Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous republic where criminal groups control and are embedded in the community.","text - economic and financial environment":"Tajikistan offers a highly unattractive environment for business and having failed to recover from the 2008 financial crisis, the banking sector remains on the verge of collapse. The bureaucratic and administrative system is unreliable, and entrepreneurship is restricted by regulations. State-owned enterprises distort the economy and corruption is rampant, while private sector industry appears to play no role in mitigating organized crime. ##&& Tajikistan is assessed to have one of the highest risks of money laundering and terrorist financing in the world. Despite having set up action task forces to combat the practice, it is particularly vulnerable to money laundering because of the prevalence of cash transactions as a result of the deficiencies in the formal banking sector, as well as the country\u2019s sizeable shadow economy; and because tackling money laundering is not high on the political agenda.","text - civil society and social protection":"Despite certain legal frameworks being in place to support victims of crime and to protect witnesses, they are deficient enough to be effectively redundant. Theoretically, compensation for victims is legally available, but is rarely provided. There is a serious lack of effective legal representation, and the subordinated judiciary means that victims are unlikely to be granted adequate justice. The government and civil society do not provide support to victims or witnesses of organized crime and victims are often themselves punished by the law. Once identified as victims by the government, they are usually passed to international or civil society organizations. Tajikistan falls considerably below international standards in reference to combating modern slavery and drug user rehabilitation. ##&& The Tajik organized crime prevention landscape has improved over the last decade, the government having, at least nominally, scaled up its efforts with regard to human trafficking in particular. The ministry of education disseminates leaflets containing information on the prohibition of child labour, a significant vulnerability in the cotton-harvesting sector. There have been various government-funded campaigns targeting human trafficking, and a national anti-trafficking commission made up of government officials, donors, NGOs and international organizations. ##&& Civil society organizations have slowly taken root and begun improving in recent years. Legislation around the formation of civil society organizations has become more liberal and regulatory thresholds for official recognition of NGOs and public associations have been lowered, while their rights have been expanded. However, local government elites closely monitor the activities of these organizations, and will prevent anything that could be perceived as political. The press environment is significantly limited and controlled, and is getting worse. Independent media outlets have been closed and websites blocked, while intelligence services intimidate, blackmail and even exile journalists. In 2020, a new countering extremism legislation was passed, which gave authorities the ability to control the internet, monitor social media activity and block websites as they see fit.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Dushanbe","GDP (current $US million)":"8116.63","Income group":"Low income","Population":"9321018","Land Area (sq. km)":"141380","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"75.1","Freedom in the World Index":"8","Human Development Index":"0.67","Global Peace Index":"2.19","Democracy Index":"1.94","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"25","GDP per capita (current US$)":"871","1":"5.62","1.1":"5.10","1.2":"6.13","2":"2.67"},{"Corresp":"172","ISO-3":"THA","Country":"Thailand","ISO-2":"TH","Continent":"Asia","Region":"South-Eastern Asia","Flag file":"th.png","1.

Armed rosewood loggers frequently confront Thai rangers, sometimes with fatal consequences. Additionally, since a 1989 ban on logging of natural forests, more than half of Thailand\u2019s wood demand is met from imports, including illegally sourced wood.

Domestic and foreign criminal groups are believed to be involved in the market, with support from corrupt police and border officials. Thailand is considered primarily a transit country for heroin and, to a lesser extent, a destination country in the region. There are also small amounts of poppy cultivation in its northern provinces that border Myanmar and Laos. Most of the heroin is trafficked across the Thai\u2013Myanmar border, before being transported elsewhere. There are regular shootouts between drug traffickers and Thai law-enforcement officials in northern Thailand. Corrupt officials are also known to facilitate the trade. Volumes of heroin seizures have been increasingly consistently over the past few years, and heroin consumption is on the rise, in particular among youth populations amid the COVID-19 pandemic. ##&& Meanwhile, cocaine trafficking does not constitute a major criminal market in Thailand. However, there was a growing demand for the drug in the country due to its massive tourism industry, which was significantly diminished by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Loose criminal networks are believed to be involved in human smuggling, drug trafficking and other criminal operations in Thailand. They are particularly concentrated on the borders between Thailand and its neighbours. Criminal networks involved in drug-trafficking operations are not believed to perpetrate significant levels of violence against civilians, except for some conflicts among small drug-trafficking groups in the northern areas. Criminal networks who perpetrate a variety of online scams are also widespread throughout Thailand. ##&& There is no evidence to suggest the existence of native Thai mafia-style groups.

Despite specific laws to prevent organized crime and several specialized anti-trafficking officers, criminal markets such as drug trafficking and human trafficking remain at high levels. Additionally, slow reform in the police structure has contributed to a soaring crime rate, increased corruption and an overall lack of transparency.

Lastly, in regard to non-renewable resources crimes, there is no evidence of theft or smuggling of oil and gas in Timor-Leste. However, revenue from the legitimate trade of oil and gas is regularly and systematically diverted towards state-embedded actors in the country.","text - drugs":"Synthetic drugs are considered to be Timor-Leste\u2019s largest drug market.

According to the most recent data, the most common type of synthetic drugs consumed in the country was ecstasy; however, use of methamphetamine was also reported, although its use was less widespread and declining. Timor-Leste is a source, transit and destination country for a small-scale cannabis market. Furthermore, the market appears to be transnational and domestic in nature, with cannabis resin being trafficked from neighbouring countries, mainly Indonesia, and cannabis herb being grown locally, especially in the mountains. Profits seem to be accrued to both domestic and foreign actors. Heroin trafficking is one of the two smallest drug markets in the country, with Timor-Leste being a transit country for relatively limited amounts of heroin. Similar to heroin, the cocaine market in Timor-Leste is considered to be small, with evidence suggesting that the market is transnational in nature, and that Timor-Leste seems to be mostly a transit country, and to a lesser extent, a destination country.","text - criminal actors":"The organized crime landscape in Timor-Leste is fairly diversified, with all types of criminal actors exerting similar, moderate levels of influence.

Many members are involved in more than one group and most groups are involved in more than one criminal activity. Overall, the access of mafia-style groups to weapons is limited, with most groups relying on low-technology weapons. Moreover, there are many local criminal networks operating in Timor-Leste.

While a 2010 law placed organized crime prevention as one of the main permanent objectives of the country\u2019s national security policy, the law did not put forward a specific criminal market as a priority. At the same time, the government has been taking steps to address problems of transparency and accountability in the public sector by establishing different institutional oversight mechanisms to control corruption. The main oversight mechanism is an anti-corruption commission and an audit court. However, their effectiveness is deemed to be limited. Overall, the primary issue is not corruption as such, but rather entrenched nepotism. ##&& In regard to international cooperation, Timor-Leste has ratified five out of the 10 major international treaties and the related protocols on organized crime. The lack of adherence to all international instruments in this fieldcan be attributed to the fact that the country is considered a post-conflict society that is still struggling to establish the rule of law. It is also an indicator of the lack of willingness or capacity of the state to respond to organized crime. However, there is evidence that Timor-Leste has been taking some constructive steps to promote international cooperation in the form of law enforcement cooperation. At a national level, the legal framework of Timor-Leste criminalizes all organized crime-related offences.

Stemming from this are several concerns about the capacity of the judicial system and the lack of special units among the judiciary, including one tasked exclusively with prosecuting organized crime. Nevertheless, the judicial system in Timor-Leste has improved considerably over the past two decades, largely as a result of support from the United Nations Development Programme and bilateral partners, notably Portugal. The country has two law enforcement agencies, the effectiveness of which in combating organized crime is seen as weak, as several police officers were also members of gangs and criminal groups in Timor-Leste. While corruption is widespread across the general police force in the country, and there is also low trust in the police among local communities, the specialized law enforcement units in Timor-Leste are highly professional. In regard to its territorial integrity, the country possesses some natural vulnerability due to its geographic position. While border control is lacking, some initiatives to strengthen control have taken place fairly recently. In general, the lack of trained law enforcement officers is one of the most significant issues that Timor-Leste faces in its efforts to successfully tackle transnational organized crime.","text - economic and financial environment":"Although Timor-Leste has in place legal and institutional measures to combat money laundering, it lacks the necessary means to combat these activities. At the same time, the country does not present serious risk of money laundering due to the small size of the financial sector and has a scarcity of attractive mechanisms that allow the whitening of the proceeds of criminal activities. On the other hand, the almost completely unregulated construction and tourism sectors offer substantial opportunities for money laundering, which has become a concern for the Australian authorities. In terms of the general business environment, the government has some legal and institutional mechanisms in place to ensure that legitimate businesses operate free from criminal activities, especially regarding labour exploitation by business owners. Nevertheless, the relative ease of doing business in the country is very low.","text - civil society and social protection":"The extent to which Timor-Leste focuses on the assistance of organized crime victims depends largely on the type of crime. In the case of people who use drugs, the law states that treatment is the responsibility of the health ministry, which includes agreements with private entities to deliver the treatment to the patients. Additionally, individuals detained with small quantities of any type of drugs may be given therapeutic treatment and the prison sentence might be suspended. Regarding legislation protecting victims of trafficking, the country has legal provisions to ensure the access of victims to different assistance measures. However, protection services are assessed to be inadequate and for the fifth consecutive year, the government failed to finalize or approve procedures for victim identification. Furthermore, government officers and police investigators failed to identify and refer any potential victims of trafficking to protection services, and law enforcement regularly detain, and in some cases deport, foreign women involved in the sex industry, without screening them for trafficking indicators. ##&& The role of non-state actors in Timor-Leste seems to be mostly associated with the development of supportive and assistance measures for victims of human trafficking. However, some NGOs also play an important role in exposing cases of corruption among the government. Meanwhile, media freedom in the country is problematic, and journalists are systematically prevented from working freely by a combination of threats of prosecution, violence at the hands of the police and public criticism of various media outlets by the government.

Human trafficking is the lifeblood of entire quarters in Istanbul and other urban areas, and is key to the border economy along the Caucasian and Iranian borders. ##&& In 2015, Turkey emerged as a key transit state for migration and smuggling to Europe from countries such as Syria. At the height of the refugee crisis, Turkey was home to some of the most active and far-reaching smuggling networks, which facilitated migrant smuggling using false documents and transporting the individuals. The smuggling industry was, and continues to be in some cases, at the centre of the local economy in a number of towns in Turkey\u2019s border regions. After the EU\u2013Turkey deal on irregular migration was reached in 2016, the human smuggling industry experienced an initial dramatic drop. However, significant numbers of Turkish nationals continued to seek the services of smuggling networks following the regime\u2019s persecution campaign against the members of the G\u00fclen Movement. Moreover, in February 2020, Turkey lifted its strict controls on its land and sea borders, prompting thousands of migrants to head to the borders to try to reach Europe. It is clear, therefore, that the Turkish state is not averse to using migrant smuggling into Europe as a political tool.","text - trade":"The illegal arms trade is pervasive in Turkey, with firearm use and arms trafficking on the rise in recent years. Overall, Turkey plays a role as simultaneously a source, transit and destination country to greater or lesser degrees. The players involved in the illegal arms market can be classified broadly under three main types. First, there are criminal networks that supply handguns and shotguns to neighbouring Iraq, Syria, Iran \u2013 and across the world. Second, there is a much more sophisticated arms trafficking coalition that works illicitly to supply more advanced and profitable weapons. Finally, state-embedded individuals are thought to be involved in illegally transferring weapons to Salafi-Jihadist groups fighting in Syria and Libya, as well as providing weapons to paramilitary groups in Turkey. In sum, the arms trafficking market, therefore, is used instrumentally by the Turkish state for external political objectives.","text - environment":"The illicit trading of non-renewable resources is a critical component of Turkey\u2019s illicit marketplace. Oil- and gold-related crimes are the two most significant. Oil smuggling is one of the more profitable sources of income for organized crime groups in Turkey, which exploit a demand for cheaper oil and the opportunity to earn tax revenue from the sale of smuggled oil, sourced primarily from Syria, Iraq and Iran. Illicit oil, which is considerably cheaper than the legal alternatives, is easily accessible in the country. There are a number of factors that contribute to the pervasiveness of oil smuggling in Turkey, including the country\u2019s high taxes, its proximity to countries with far-lower oil prices, its difficulties in controlling its long borders, and its pervasive corruption. Indeed, there is ample evidence linking high-level politicians to the purchase and subsequent illicit sale of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of Islamic State oil disguised as Turkish and Iraqi Kurdish oil. With regard to gold-related criminal activity, most comes in the form of sanctions violations and associated money laundering, with recent cases illustrating the connections made by the Turkish state with Iran and Venezuela, among others. Given the country\u2019s currency crisis, coupled with its growing relationship with Venezuela and efforts to circumvent the Iranian sanctions regime, it is likely that the illicit market for non-renewable resources will continue to grow in scope and value. ##&& Other environmental criminal markets are less pervasive in Turkey, although they remain important features of the country\u2019s illicit economy. The intentional burning of forests, one of the most severe forms of environmental degradation in Turkey, to open the path for commercial developments, is a regular occurrence in coastal areas, a phenomenon in which government corruption and political interests are key factors. With regard to fauna crimes, seizures of traditionally trafficked illegal wildlife products, such as pangolins and rhino horn, suggest that, largely as a result of the country\u2019s location and status as a global transport hub, Turkey plays an important role in the transnational illegal wildlife trade. Domestically, however, fauna crimes are not particularly pervasive.","text - drugs":"Although most drug markets are important in Turkey, the heroin trade is by far the most pervasive drug market in the country. Turkey\u2019s proximity to major heroin-producing Afghanistan and to considerable consumer markets in Europe and the Middle East has made it an important link in the heroin trade chain. Turkish organized criminal gangs control the wholesale importation of heroin into Europe. An increase in acetic anhydride seizures, a key precursor for processing morphine into heroin, suggests that heroin production is on the rise in Turkey, with laboratories scattered across Istanbul and in eastern provinces at the border. There is thought to be a two-way trafficking route between the Netherlands and Turkey, whereby heroin and morphine are trafficked from Turkey to the Netherlands, while acetic anhydride, MDMA (commonly known as Ecstasy), and other drugs are moved in the opposite direction. Indeed, the prevalence of synthetic drug use, primarily methamphetamine and synthetic cannabinoids \u2013 known as \u2018bonsai\u2019 \u2013 has been on the rise in recent years, largely because of the easy access to the drugs and their relatively low price. Turkey also acts as a transit country for Captagon (the drug compound fenethylline hydrochloride), with tablets produced in south-eastern Europe smuggled through the country en route to the Middle East. ##&& Cannabis use is fairly common in Turkey and it has been increasing in recent years, particularly among young males. Cannabis cultivation, both licit and illicit, is widespread, with the latter concentrated predominantly in the south-eastern region of Turkey and controlled largely by the Kurdistan Workers' Party and its associated groups and individuals. The cocaine market is fairly limited. Turkey is not on the major transnational cocaine trafficking routes and does not play an important role as a transit route for cocaine, although the prevalence of cocaine trafficking does appear to have increased recently.","text - criminal actors":"Turkey has become known as a mafia state and the evidence suggests that this is the case, now more than ever. The Turkish government often leverages certain criminal markets, such as the gold and oil trade, human smuggling and arms trafficking, for its own benefit and political purpose. Depending on political circumstances and geopolitical relations with other countries, the Turkish government chooses to either tighten or ease its control over organized criminal activity. State-embedded individuals are thought to be involved in illegally transferring weapons to Salafi-Jihadist groups fighting in Syria and Libya, as well as providing weapons to paramilitary groups in Turkey. Organized crime and state-embedded individuals have extremely strong and complex links, dating back many decades and continuing to today. There are a significant number of mafia-style groups operating in Turkey, modelled on the traditional mafia typology, with a strong hierarchy centred on the head of family, known as a baba. But these have gradually declined in Turkey, increasingly replaced by looser, compartmentalized networks of semi-autonomous cells. ##&& There are a huge number of loose criminal networks predominantly in areas close to Turkey's sea and land borders, such as Adana, Izmir, Diyarbakir, Reyhanli, Gaziantep and Istanbul. These networks engage in a litany of cross-border smuggling activities, ranging from trafficking narcotics to smuggling migrants. The capacity and influence of these criminal networks has increased in recent years, as have their links with criminal networks in neighbouring countries and beyond. With the growth and increasing diversity of illicit economies in Turkey, ad hoc networks are far more influential and more reflective of the nature of both licit and illicit trade than mafia-style groups.  ##&& Although organized crime in Turkey is dominated by domestic criminal individuals, foreign criminals operate in the country as well, primarily in cross-border smuggling, including migrants, drugs and weapons, but also in transnational human trafficking operations. As such, their areas of operation are concentrated at the country's land borders and there is strong collaboration between these foreign and domestic-organized criminals. Foreign mafia groups and illegally armed groups, including terrorist groups that engage in organized criminal activity, are becoming increasingly visible in Turkey, exacerbated to a large extent by the spillover effects from conflict in neighbouring countries.","text - leadership and governance":"An increasing trend towards authoritarianism in Turkey by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan reached its peak in the wake of an attempted coup in 2016. In 2017, the regime adopted constitutional changes that concentrated power in the hands of the president. While the Turkish government has taken a public stance on organized crime, and it is a campaign issue in the country, it is used merely as a rhetorical tool for the state\u2019s own political purposes. Transparency and accountability are very limited and deteriorating. Almost all oversight mechanisms in the country are directly appointed and controlled by the government and are often used as a political tool to clamp down on dissent and political opposition. Corruption is rife across all levels of the state apparatus, due in large part to the ineffective anti-corruption agencies in the country and the inconsistent application of anti-corruption laws, all of which combine to create a culture of impunity. The extent to which the government not only abets organized crime but is the perpetrator of organized criminal activity on an industrial scale is the critical challenge facing policymakers and law enforcement generally. ##&& Turkey has a robust anti-organized crime legal framework, including legislation on most forms of organized crime, as well as legislation criminalizing the establishment and membership of an organized criminal organization. However, despite the strong presence of legislation pertaining to organized crime in Turkey, there is a major issue in the lack of application and enforcement of these laws. The problem in Turkey is not that anti-organized crime policies and legislation do not exist, but that such tools effectively become redundant when the entire system of government acts in such a way as to undermine them. On paper, Turkey appears to have strong bilateral and multilateral cooperation frameworks in place, including having ratified all relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, but these are largely a relic of the country\u2019s history as an ally of the Western world. Cooperation between Turkey and the US Drug Enforcement Agency, for example, has weakened considerably since 2016, which has damaged the Turkish National Police\u2019s ability to deal with drug trafficking. Similarly, although extradition treaties are in place with a whole host of countries, there are severe concerns regarding the use of extradition processes and requests on the part of the Turkish government, which uses them only as a political tool, but also engages in illegal renditioning of suspected coup plotters. Concerns have been raised about the Turkish government\u2019s prolific abuse of INTERPOL\u2019s red-notice system to unfairly target journalists, activists and political opponents living abroad.","text - criminal justice and security":"Turkey\u2019s extensive sea and land boundaries, combined with its position at the crossroads of Asia and Europe \u2013 located as it is on the primary trafficking routes of a number of illicit economies \u2013 make control of the country\u2019s borders challenging. Stretches of the border, in particular those with Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan are particularly porous. However, many of the illicit flows across the Turkish borders are by design and are sanctioned by official authorities who do otherwise have the capacity to stop them. Overall, law enforcement capacity in Turkey is fairly strong, with a well-trained and well-equipped police and border force, as well as a number of special law enforcement units focusing on organized crime. However, corrupt practices are commonplace in Turkey\u2019s already highly politicized law enforcement, and police abuse is customary. Similar criticism can be levelled at the country\u2019s judicial system, which is similarly highly politicized. The government has appointed thousands of judges loyal to the regime, which, with the purge of the judicial system following the failed coup in 2016 and the potential ramifications of ruling against the executive, has severely weakened judicial independence in Turkey. From local courts to the constitutional court, the Turkish judicial system, which is the most effectively used tool against political dissidents, is under the control of Erdo\u011fan. Long detention and pretrial periods are increasingly common in Turkey, and prison conditions are generally unsatisfactory, with severe overcrowding a major issue. Overall, therefore, as with many of the policies, legislation and institutional structures in Turkey, the judicial and detention systems look robust on paper but their effectiveness is severely compromised by the lack of independence and the extraordinary degree of interference and control by the Turkish state.","text - economic and financial environment":"Turkey is a regional financial centre for countries in Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Middle East and Eastern Europe, and faces significant money laundering risks, including the illicit proceeds from drug and human trafficking, and migrant and fuel smuggling. Although significant improvements to the anti-money laundering framework have been made in recent years, a number of serious shortcomings remain about issues such as proceeds of crime confiscation, managing frozen assets and the lack of restrictions on entering the country with substantial sums of cash, which makes tracking money laundering extremely difficult. Furthermore, the government\u2019s money laundering investigative activity has been criticized for being overtly politicized, and state-embedded individuals are likely to be involved, be it directly or indirectly, in money laundering operations.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Turkish government has implemented and engaged in a number of organized-crime prevention initiatives, primarily in the trade of illicit drugs and human trafficking. The prevention of drug use is a key pillar of the state\u2019s national drug strategy, which offers drug users rehabilitation and access to information through various awareness campaigns. Opioid substitution therapy is available in Turkey and the penal code provides for the option of treatment for drug users in place of a custodial sentence. ##&& Support for victims of human trafficking is relatively robust in Turkey, although there is a need for an increased number of victim shelters and an improvement to victim identification systems. Overall, both prevention, and victim and witness support measures in the country are sufficient. However, measures to prevent organized crime are often used as a political tool by the Erdo\u011fan government, namely with regard to the prevention of human smuggling, as evidenced by the government\u2019s decision to lift its strict controls on its land and sea borders. ##&& Where Turkey fails comprehensively with regard to civil society and social protection measures is in its treatment of non-state individuals. As part of the government's broader shift towards authoritarianism, in particular since the 2016 failed coup, non-state individuals are increasingly targeted if they are viewed by the Erdo\u011fan regime as political opponents. The clampdown is perhaps most visible in the field of journalism and freedom of the press: the government has eliminated dozens of media outlets and the country\u2019s biggest media group was taken over by a pro-government conglomerate. Turkey is one of the world\u2019s worst offenders for jailing journalists. The greatest opposition to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s regime comes through social media, often by Turkish citizens in exile, which precipitated the introduction in October 2020 of repressive legislation aiming to limit access to social media platforms. Nevertheless, despite concerted efforts by the Turkish regime to stifle freedom of the press, Turkey\u2019s civil society generally has shown impressive resilience and ability to evolve in the face of such challenges.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Ankara","GDP (current $US million)":"761425.50","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"83429615","Land Area (sq. km)":"785350","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"79.7","Freedom in the World Index":"32","Human Development Index":"0.82","Global Peace Index":"2.96","Democracy Index":"4.48","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"40","GDP per capita (current US$)":"9127","1":"6.89","1.1":"6.40","1.2":"7.38","2":"3.54"},{"Corresp":"179","ISO-3":"TKM","Country":"Turkmenistan","ISO-2":"TM","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Central Asia and the Caucasus","Flag file":"tm.png","1.

The number of Turkmens seeking migration abroad for employment makes them vulnerable to being trafficked into forced labour in foreign markets, such as Turkey, Russia and India. Turkmen women are also particularly vulnerable to being trafficked abroad for the purposes of sexual exploitation. ##&& Although Turkmenistan is not as major a player in the transnational human smuggling market, it is nevertheless a waypoint for the smuggling of individuals from Asia to Europe.

While the numbers of seizures are small and have declined in recent years \u2013 up until the government stopped declaring seizures of opium and heroin in 2016 \u2013 there are suggestions that the small volumes of seizures could point to officials being involved in the illicit activity. Significant seizures in Afghanistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, taking place near their borders with Turkmenistan, suggest there may be higher volumes of heroin crossing the border than the authorities admit. Figures around the small domestic market for heroin use are also thought to be unreliable. There is little evidence to support the existence of a significant cocaine market in Turkmenistan. ##&& A domestic market for cannabis does exist in Turkmenistan, but use is relatively low by global standards. Similarly, the extent of the synthetic drugs market is fairly limited in the country, although scarce data shows Turkmenistan was the only country in the region to report an emergence of new psychoactive substances.","text - criminal actors":"Turkmenistan has a history of dealing violently, but effectively, with mafia bosses, having eradicated all active leaders in the 1990s and even performing public executions. Currently, the most prominent mafia-style groups in Turkmenistan are the \u2018thieves-in-law,\u2019 where members adhere to a particular lifestyle taking oaths and living only off the profits generated by criminal activity. The groups\u2019 control, however, should not be overstated, as they generally only perform tasks outsourced by the government, such as operations within the prison population. Nevertheless, mafia-style groups have minimal control over the prison system overall. While these groups are thought to have some access to weapons, they do not carry arms openly. ##&& There is some evidence of loose criminal networks in Turkmenistan, but it is more common for Turkmen to cooperate with transnational heroin trafficking organizations, usually consisting of US, Afghan and Sri Lankan nationals. There are also reports of Turkmen criminal groups racketeering Turkmen labour migrants in Turkey. These networks are widespread, operating throughout the country, and although the level of violence they employ varies, it is particularly high surrounding the human trafficking market. ##&& As Turkmenistan is a dictatorship, state institutions are weak and corruption levels are extremely high among state actors, which means the state often creates and facilitates criminal markets and ideal conditions for them to thrive. Governmental transparency is low and public infrastructure contracts are often used as a way to allow elites to pocket state funds. Corruption is particularly prevalent in the highest echelons of government, where President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov has control over the entire economy, legal and illegal, and power is passed on by nepotism rather than democratic processes.

On the whole, the government is highly ineffective and governs in its own self-interest. ##&& In general, the public has a severe lack of trust in the government, especially in the public sector and construction industry. The 2018 election lacked the prerequisites of a democratic process, and there is no information available to the public on government spending and budgets. Turkmenistan is a highly isolated country, with little interest in regional or international cooperation with other Commonwealth of Independent States countries or further afield. With the exception of the Arms Trade Treaty and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, Turkmenistan has ratified most relevant treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, but does not participate in them meaningfully.

No independent judicial control exists, and international bodies are prevented from carrying out meaningful audits. Courts are unable to pass effective judgement against organized crime defendants or high-profile criminals. Turkmenistan has one of the highest imprisonment rates in the world, which has led to serious overcrowding, substandard conditions and lack of adequate medical treatment for inmates. Torture and forced confessions are widespread especially in pre-trials, and corruption is rife among prison officials. ##&& Like most other resources of the state, law enforcement lies in the president\u2019s control and is usually used to fight dissenters and political opponents rather than punish and prevent organized crime, especially since the unit established to fight organized crime was dissolved. The national police are tasked with maintaining internal security, and the ministry of national security, the successor to the KGB that uses similar methods, is deployed to prevent drug trafficking. There are no civilian oversight bodies governing the use of police force, and while there are laws to prevent arbitrary arrest, the practice seems to continue unchecked. ##&& Turkmenistan\u2019s borders are long, porous and difficult to police, and the country is situated on major trafficking routes in proximity to notable criminal markets such as the opium and heroin markets of Afghanistan. While trafficking by sea seems less common due to the country\u2019s legitimate exports of controlled goods such as oil from its ports, the roads between Turkmenistan and its bordering countries have improved substantially over the past decade, and have facilitated smuggling by land.

There have been many stories of corruption among business leaders and the Turkmen government. The president has a small number of patronage networks that control the economy and distribute wealth and business opportunities to his circle of appointees, leading to a culture of bribery, nepotism and embezzlement.","text - civil society and social protection":"While some national laws around social protection exist, the government rarely implements them meaningfully. The government has not responded to help victims of human trafficking, contrary to its obligations under its anti-trafficking law, instead leaving international non-state actors to provide treatment and care.

The government did however cooperate with NGOs to conduct awareness campaigns in rural areas, providing at-risk groups with training, information and school discussions around exploitation and trafficking. ##&& Independent groups face incredibly difficult obstacles in openly carrying out human rights work in Turkmenistan. There exists a burdensome and punitive registration system that effectively prevents most independent NGOs from operating or fundraising.

In combination with the continuation of the sponsorship (Kafala) system and a failure of the government of the UAE to meet the minimum standards for combating trafficking and smuggling, the demand for cheap labour enables both human smuggling and trafficking on a relatively large scale. According to documented cases, women are most often trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation, though many are also trafficked for domestic servitude and labour. Male victims, conversely, tend to be trafficked for labour purposes. Most victims of human trafficking are tricked into debt by recruitment agencies or experience their sponsors in the UAE withholding identity papers or wages. Besides human trafficking, local demand for cheap labour has fuelled irregular migration into the UAE, one of the most popular destinations for Filipino migrant workers, many of whom hire smugglers to enter the country. The evidence also suggests that many irregular migrants stay in the country only temporarily before journeying onto other destinations in the Middle East or South Africa.

In recent years, the UAE has seen the emergence of an illegal wildlife marketplace for exotic and endangered species on social media platforms where traders can avoid disclosing their identities.

Drug trafficking organizations of South Asian origin are believed to be responsible for much of the trade in heroin, cocaine and cannabis, whereas the criminal actors involved in the smuggling of synthetic drugs tend to be from a diverse set of countries, including Indonesia, Libya and Mexico.

There are also recurrent allegations of torture and mistreatment during custody, wheel there are reports of overcrowding in UAE prisons as well as occasional reports of substandard sanitary conditions and food shortages. Law enforcement bodies in the UAE, particularly in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, are sufficiently resourced and the police forces have a number of specialized units, such as a unit responsible for countering human trafficking. Lastly, the UAE has placed a strong emphasis on border control and territorial integrity, implementing the highest levels of technology at its airports and seaports. However, the country still faces several challenges given its geographic location on several transnational smuggling routes and in proximity to countries with prominent criminal markets.","text - economic and financial environment":"The UAE is a competitive investment destination and a relatively easy place to do business. Reforms in recent years have sought to further ease procedures for establishing and operating businesses in the country. At the same time, state interference can sometimes be an impediment to private sector development and the ruling families have considerable influence over the economy, potentially skewing market competition and openness. ##&& Money laundering and terrorist financing is a large-scale, systemic risk in the UAE and the country has become a global centre for money laundering. In spite of attempts at addressing the issue, for instance by setting up a financial intelligence unit and implementing economic substance requirements which resulted in the removal of the UAE from the European Union\u2019s \u2018blacklist\u2019 of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes, the UAE\u2019s framework for AML\/CFT has not fully been capable of addressing the country\u2019s money laundering and terrorist financing vulnerabilities. The property market in Dubai, in particular, has become a key means for organized criminals, corrupt politicians and terrorist networks to launder money with very few restrictions.","text - civil society and social protection":"In recent years, the UAE has begun to explore more crime prevention strategies. For instance, law enforcement has worked towards an increased focus on community policing, and the UAE\u2019s national committee to combat human trafficking has adopted a strategic plan that puts prevention at the centre of its efforts. The government of the UAE has also voiced increasing awareness of the role of the private sector in responding to the challenges posed by organized crime and terrorism. However, few concrete steps have been taken to provide civil society with a genuine civil role in the fight against organized crime. With regard to support for victims of organized crime, the UAE\u2019s human trafficking support services infrastructure is relatively robust, including the provision of victim shelters and training courses and rehabilitation services to victims. Significant improvements can be made, however, including by improving potential victim identification procedures and by improving access to support services for victims of labour trafficking in particular. With regard to drug use, although it is a taboo subject in the UAE, the rehabilitation can be offered as an alternative to punishment through the criminal justice system. Finally, in 2020, the government introduced a witness protection program, although the effectiveness of the program remains to be seen. ##&& The space for civil society actors, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly in the UAE remains heavily restricted. The media, too, has often been suppressed harshly, journalists are subject to surveillance and, on several occasions in recent years, critical journalists have been arrested for allegedly disseminating false information.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Abu Dhabi","GDP (current $US million)":"421142.27","Income group":"High income","Population":"9770529","Land Area (sq. km)":"98648","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"40.3","Freedom in the World Index":"17","Human Development Index":"0.89","Global Peace Index":"1.75","Democracy Index":"2.70","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"71","GDP per capita (current US$)":"43103","1":"5.75","1.1":"6.75","1.2":"4.75","2":"5.33"},{"Corresp":"187","ISO-3":"UZB","Country":"Uzbekistan","ISO-2":"UZ","Continent":"Asia","Region":"Central Asia and the Caucasus","Flag file":"uz.png","1.

Aside from the agricultural sector, Uzbek men are most commonly trafficked into forced labour in the construction and oil and gas markets in Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkey and other surrounding countries. In recent years, the labour market in Russia has become less attractive to Uzbeks, and they are increasingly being trafficked into Turkey as an alternative. Allegedly, law enforcement agencies in the country are complicit in recruiting potential victims and facilitating trafficking. The human smuggling market is less pervasive, largely due to the existence of visa-free travel among the majority of Central Asian states, thus rendering the services of smugglers unnecessary. However, some Uzbek nationals seek the services of smugglers in order to obtain the necessary work visas. Indeed, Uzbek labour migrants are particularly vulnerable to exploitation as most do not possess the necessary documents required to work in Russia.","text - trade":"While the illicit arms trade exists in the Central Asia region and within Uzbekistan, it is a small market due to the inherited cultural attitudes from the Soviet Union, where guns were only owned by registered hunters and state officials. Arms are reportedly seized from people crossing Uzbek borders, but gun possession by civilians has been in decline in recent years, decreasing approximately tenfold over the past decade.","text - environment":"The flora crimes market is dominated by illicit logging, typically during the autumn and winter months, when natural gas supplies are cut off to many households and businesses, creating a need for fuelwood for cooking and heating. Corrupt local authorities are complicit in allowing organized crime groups and business interests to facilitate and manage illicit logging. The fauna crimes market is similarly small, with around 300 cases reported each year, usually consisting of poaching and possession of protected species, alongside illegal fishing. There are cases of endangered species being kept for display, such as falcons and lions, and the trade is domestic as well as international. Corruption payments are made to low-level officials to ensure the trade can continue unpunished. As Uzbekistan is a large producer of gold, the illegal extraction, mining and smuggling of the metal is the most common natural-resource crime. The market is driven by both domestic and international demand and is facilitated by bribes. However, following the legalization of mining for precious metals by private individuals and companies, levels of illicit gold mining have declined. Nevertheless, the oil and gas sector that is controlled by the state is opaque and prone to corruption.","text - drugs":"Due to Uzbekistan\u2019s proximity to Afghanistan, it is an important transit country for heroin originating in Afghanistan headed for Western Europe and Russia. This trade is mainly run by foreign criminal actors, particularly from Turkey. However, since Uzbekistan introduced counterterrorism measures to tighten its borders with Afghanistan and Tajikistan, the volume of opiates transiting through the country has reduced, diverted instead to other neighbouring countries. ##&& The consumption, distribution and sale of synthetic drugs, especially Tramadol, are on the rise in Uzbekistan and there have been a number of large seizures of various psychoactive substances in recent years. The demand driving the synthetic drug market is both domestic and international. There have also been large seizures of marijuana in recent years, where prevailing demand comes from abroad. There appears to be a negligible market for cocaine.","text - criminal actors":"A remnant of the Soviet period, the \u2018thieves-in-law\u2019 are the primary mafia-style group operating in Uzbekistan. The group exhibits strong characteristics of traditional mafia-style groups, such as the requirement on the part of all members to take an oath, uphold a code and live exclusively off criminal profits. These criminals participate in extortion, illustrating the extent to which they have integrated into the business community, where they combine legal and illegal activities and benefit from protection by representatives of the government. The group had grown into a vast criminal network globally, and spread through the former Soviet Union, Europe and the US, but is slowly losing its influence. Furthermore, there are several loose criminal networks, with links to foreign criminal groups, operating in the most prevalent markets across the country, such as human trafficking, gold mining and the drug trade. ##&& The criminal activity of state-embedded actors, and the intertwining of criminal groups and the government, has meant that the state has effectively co-opted organized criminal activity. Corruption is rampant in the Uzbek government, and two of Uzbekistan\u2019s alleged top criminal leaders hold government positions, demonstrating the embeddedness of criminal groups in the state apparatus. Law enforcement officials are also vital to the functioning of organized crime and sometimes take up very active roles exploiting their position to assist in crimes, as most transnational criminal flows occur under the protection of border control officials, low- and mid-level officials and likely - certain ministers. The Uzbekistani state is also involved in drug trafficking; and in other legitimate areas of the economy, such as cotton production, the government remains enmeshed with criminal actors. ##&& There are no foreign diasporas controlling any of the organized criminal markets in Uzbekistan, and only minimal to moderate interactions with foreign criminal actors occurs within the country. However, due to Uzbekistan\u2019s roots in the Soviet Union and the continuation of the \u2018thieves-in-law\u2019 style of criminal organization, criminal networks are closely linked to Russia, as well as their neighbouring Central Asian nations.","text - leadership and governance":"Since 2016, when Shavkat Mirziyoyev succeeded Islam Karimov as president of Uzbekistan, there have been small signs of limited liberalization of the ruling regime. However, these have not been significant enough to restore faith in the government and the democratic process. The democratic process is not independently protected and has been widely corrupted and penetrated by organized crime, with many senior government officials accused of criminal activity. Public resources are misused in the country to sustain power and wealth for those in, or close to, the ruling elite. Despite Uzbekistan\u2019s governmental operations being largely opaque, it did introduce an online mechanism allowing citizens to file complaints and report problems with the government, which has been expanded to all ministries and local government offices. The government also publishes its budget online, but in a country that needs wide institutional reform and the introduction of a meaningful separation of powers, the changes are piecemeal and do little to improve Uzbekistan\u2019s statute as one of the world's most corrupt states. ##&& There have been small signs of improvement in Uzbekistan\u2019s international cooperation framework. The current administration has made an effort to improve relations with neighbouring countries, settling many border disputes and laying the groundwork for future collaboration in combatting transnational crime. The country has ratified several, but not all, relevant international treaties pertaining to organized crime, and generally cooperates in extradition cases. Uzbekistan is also a member of INTERPOL and speaks with intent about combating illicit drug trafficking and transnational organized crime, although significant tangible results have yet to be identified. While Uzbekistan\u2019s national legal framework is well-crafted and criminalizes almost all organized crime activities, the levels of corruption and widespread evasion of justice undermine the importance of the legal structure.","text - criminal justice and security":"Despite constitutional provisions, the judiciary in Uzbekistan is not independent, with judges merely rubber-stamping verdicts passed down by law enforcement agencies and the prosecutor general\u2019s office. Corruption is rampant in the judicial system, with many businesses needing to pay bribes to continue operating and judicial positions obtained through bribes. The judiciary is effectively controlled by the executive and, despite recent judicial reform aimed at creating a more independent judiciary, the courts are entirely ineffective at combating organized crime and are usually used as a way for elites to shore up power and evade justice. With regard to the detention system in the country, Uzbekistan\u2019s prisons, which are shrouded in secrecy, are notorious for the physical abuse and torture of inmates. However, in 2020, the government took steps to increase transparency surrounding the country\u2019s penitentiaries, releasing, for the first time, data on the prison system and its detainees. ##&& Corruption is rife throughout all levels of law enforcement. Police are known to frequently extort bribes, cover up corruption and intimidate whistle-blowers to ensure the interests of the ruling elite are preserved. Trust among the public for law enforcement is extremely low, and many victims of crime are unwilling to self-identify and cooperate with the police out of fear. Uzbekistan\u2019s border is extremely difficult to manage as a result of its long, difficult terrain and its proximity to countries with thriving international criminal markets, such as Afghanistan\u2019s opium trade. The capacity for border control is hampered by disputes around demarcation of boundaries with both Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Alongside these strategic difficulties, border control officials are involved in corruption and criminal activity themselves. Uzbekistan has made strides in reinforcing the dangerous border it shares with Afghanistan due to the fear of an over-spill of radical Islamic insurgencies, and this has also led to a restriction in the flow of opium.","text - economic and financial environment":"Uzbekistan\u2019s banking sector operates in a non-transparent environment, lacks effective oversight and is therefore vulnerable to money laundering. The banks are usually small and under close state control. Despite a few attempts to limit money laundering through legislation and the creation of commissions, the government has created only mild obstacles to the misuse of banks and financial institutions by well-connected people. ##&& The capacity of the government to ensure that legitimate businesses are able to operate free from the influence of criminal groups has improved over the past two decades, especially after the new president\u2019s economic modernization reforms. The procedure for business registration has been simplified, interference by regulatory bodies has been reduced and currency controls have been abolished. Uzbekistan is satisfactorily conducive to business and allows for business expansion, but there are many bureaucratic processes to deal with, in addition to poorly enforced land and property rights, and widespread corruption.","text - civil society and social protection":"Uzbekistan provides some assistance to victims of organized crime, but care is mainly provided by civil society organizations. The government has opened 130 centres to assist vulnerable people and trafficking victims and provides some funding, but they are generally under-resourced and the staff inadequately trained. The lack of trust in government and law enforcement also means many victims are reluctant to report crimes committed against them, and when they do, their identities are rarely kept confidential in court proceedings. Furthermore, the government does not provide legal representation for victims who are unable to pay for it. The government has modified its agricultural policies and run public awareness campaigns concerning the prohibition of child labour in the cotton harvest and to educate citizens about their labour rights. Another positive step has been the adoption of a law aimed at strengthening the protections of human trafficking victims and aiding their rehabilitation. Nevertheless, it is still early to assess the effectiveness of the latter law. ##&& Although civil society organizations and human rights activists have played vital roles in drawing attention to forced labour during the cotton harvest, the government is hostile towards any perceived criticism from these groups and only cooperates in limited ways. Media freedoms are severely limited in Uzbekistan and no criticism of the government is tolerated. Despite this, small improvements have been made under the new president, with the freeing of imprisoned journalists, access to censored websites being granted and media registration being simplified. Despite this surveillance, censorship, threats and arrests are still very much present in the media sphere.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Tashkent","GDP (current $US million)":"57921.29","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"33580350","Land Area (sq. km)":"448924","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"72","Freedom in the World Index":"11","Human Development Index":"0.72","Global Peace Index":"2.16","Democracy Index":"2.12","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"26","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1725","1":"4.97","1.1":"4.55","1.2":"5.38","2":"3.79"},{"Corresp":"190","ISO-3":"VNM","Country":"Vietnam","ISO-2":"VN","Continent":"Asia","Region":"South-Eastern Asia","Flag file":"vn.png","1.

It is a major source country for the trafficking of women and girls, particularly from ethnic-minority groups and poorer backgrounds, into regional and global sex industries. Moreover, both Vietnamese adults and children are trafficked into forced labour and\/or sexual exploitation in Europe, the Middle East and other parts of Asia. To a lesser extent, Vietnam is a destination country for Cambodian and Lao children trafficked into forced labour and\/or sexual exploitation. Criminal actors involved in this market include local recruitment agencies, family members and acquaintances of victims,as well as foreign actors. State-embedded actors are also known to facilitate cross-border trafficking operations. The rise of sophisticated cybercrimes has contributed to trafficking activities. Although the official numbers of human-trafficking victims have decreased in recent years, many believe that this is due to a lack of effort to gain information on the part of the Vietnamese authorities. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic is believed to have worsened human trafficking in Vietnam as more people have become vulnerable to exploitation (in particular online), illicit activities have become harder to detect and it has become more difficult to provide direct assistance for vulnerable communities and survivors. ##&& Vietnam\u2019s human-smuggling market is believed to have grown in recent years. Many Vietnamese nationals employ smugglers in search of economic stability abroad, particularly other parts of Asia and Europe. Smuggling networks are highly organized and are closely linked with communities in the destination countries. Like human trafficking, Vietnamese authorities are suspected to facilitate cross-border smuggling operations.","text - trade":"Vietnam is potentially a source, destination and transit country for arms trafficking. Despite strict arms regulations, most current civilian possession in the country is illegal. Loose criminal networks are known to sell illicit arms online or at the country\u2019s borders, while mafia-style groups sell arms primarily in the capital. Foreign actors also engage in the market, predominantly as buyers. The illicit manufacturing of arms is reportedly on the rise, with most privately manufactured arms being primarily used for agricultural or hunting purposes and sold publicly online or via local networks.","text - environment":"Vietnam is a significant source country for illicit timber in the region, as well as illegal timber trafficking from Laos and Cambodia and the smuggling of rosewood from the Mekong region to China. Highly organized, hierarchical organizations are involved in cross-border timber trafficking, which is protected and facilitated by widespread corruption. Illicit logging has resulted in the country losing half of its forest cover over the last 50 years. Similarly, Vietnam\u2019s fauna-crimes market has significantly threatened wildlife populations. It is among the largest globally, particularly its illicit ivory market. Moreover, Vietnamese criminal networks are also known to be involved in rhino-horn trafficking, pangolin trafficking, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and captive-bred tiger parts and products. Corruption is known to play a significant role in the market, with officials routinely accepting bribes to facilitate domestic sales and the cross-border trafficking. ##&& Vietnam is also a destination country for oil, gold and diamond smuggling in the region. Vietnam, together with Thailand, is considered to have the largest oil-smuggling markets in South-eastern Asia. While oil smuggling primarily involves Vietnamese criminal networks, state-embedded actors, local fisherman and foreign actors are also known to be involved.","text - drugs":"Heroin is one of Vietnam\u2019s largest drug markets. Given its proximity to the Golden Triangle, Vietnam serves primarily as a destination market and as a transit country for heroin to Australia and New Zealand. The country\u2019s heroin trade is concentrated along its borders with Laos and Cambodia, where drug lords often rely on poor communities and ethnic minorities to transport heroin across borders. There are strong linkages between organized criminal networks in Vietnam and expatriates in source and destination countries. Corrupt government officials facilitate this trade, as do border officials in the rural borderland provinces. Meanwhile, the synthetic-drug trade is a growing problem in Vietnam. As a transnational hub, Vietnam is both a destination and transit country for methamphetamines produced in the Golden Triangle. It is also a source and transit country for ecstasy and ketamine. ##&& Vietnam is a destination country for cannabis from the USA, Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, Australia, Laos and Cambodia. Additionally, illicit cultivation, storage, trade and use of cannabis within Vietnam is on the rise, especially among Vietnamese youth and students. Vietnam is a transit country for cocaine trafficked from China, Laos and Cambodia, as well as a destination country for cocaine smuggled via cargo from Europe and West Africa. While cocaine is Vietnam\u2019s smallest drug market, the trafficking of cocaine is reportedly on the rise in the country, evidenced by the increase in cocaine detection and seizures.","text - criminal actors":"Mafia-style criminal groups operate throughout Vietnam, and are mostly involved in the human-trafficking, arms-trafficking and drug-trafficking markets. In particular, local drug lords control territory in the north-western provinces, while arms-trafficking groups control territory in Ho Chi Minh City. Although mafia-style group members have been widely reported to carry knives, swords and guns openly, the rate of violence from these groups is low to moderate, although it may be higher in areas where drug trafficking is more prominent. Similarly, Vietnamese criminal networks have been linked to the human-trafficking and human-smuggling markets, the ivory- and pangolin-trafficking markets, illicit logging operations, arms trafficking, and drug-trafficking markets. Those involved in heroin trafficking are most heavily concentrated along Vietnam\u2019s northern and central northern borders with Laos. Transnational linkages also exist between Vietnamese and foreign criminal networks. ##&& Although Vietnam officially claims to be implementing strict policies to combat organized crime, corrupt officials and state involvement in criminal markets have made it more challenging to assess their purported zero-tolerance stance. State-embedded actors exercise a certain degree of control over Vietnam\u2019s illicit logging market, and have also been known to engage in fuel smuggling and other criminal activities. Involvement allegedly occurs at all levels of the state apparatus, although higher-level officials tend to be more involved in flora-related crimes, while low-level officials tend to be more involved in human smuggling and non-renewable-resource crimes. As for foreign actors, since the liberalization of its economic system Vietnam has faced a number of practical challenges from foreign criminal networks, particularly along its northern borders. There is no evidence to suggest that foreign actors exert significant control over criminal markets, although some do have considerable influence in the online gambling market.","text - leadership and governance":"Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party is the only legal political party in the country, forcing other political parties to operate either in secret or from abroad. There has allegedly been growing public discontent with the Vietnamese Communist Party in recent years, particularly as official corruption in the form of kickbacks, gift requests, nepotism and cronyism remains rampant. While corruption-related arrests and prosecutions against senior officials have reportedly increased in recent years, anti-corruption law enforcement remains highly selective and is linked to political rivalries. On organized crime, while the government has officially taken a strong stance, the presence of state-embedded actors in criminal markets impedes these efforts. ##&& At the international level, Vietnam is a signatory to major UN conventions, as well as bilateral and multilateral agreements, to combat organized crime. The country is also an official member of international and regional police organizations. At the national level, Vietnam lacks legislation specific to organized crime. However, criminal offences incur more severe punishment if they occur in an \u2018organized manner'. While human trafficking was criminalized in 2015, ambiguity exists in its definition. Similarly, drug trafficking, human smuggling, arms trafficking and flora crimes were also criminalized under the 2015 penal code, including the death penalty for possession, transport or trade of large quantities of heroin and methamphetamines. Although non-renewable-resource crimes are addressed in the 2015 code, penalties are limited to fines and the confiscation of assets.","text - criminal justice and security":"Vietnam lacks an independent judiciary. Nevertheless, the country\u2019s judicial system does take a strong stance against drug-related crimes, evidenced by the greater prosecution of drug crimes over other criminal markets. There are also harsher sentences for drug crimes, including the death penalty. Vietnam has the third-highest execution rate in the world, and has been criticized for its harsh prison conditions. Regarding law enforcement, Vietnam has reduced its anti-trafficking efforts in recent years. Additionally, there has been a reduction in human-trafficking investigations and prosecutions, due in part to a lack of collaboration between government agencies and municipalities, low budgets and low levels of trafficking awareness, as well as delays in implementing anti-trafficking legislation. Vietnam has also been accused of failing to combat flora, fauna and oil crimes. Meanwhile, law enforcement has increased efforts to curb arms trafficking, and state-owned media sources have reported an increase in the detection and seizing of illicit drugs. Since Vietnam\u2019s north-western borders are particularly vulnerable to criminal markets, the country has also made an effort to strengthen its border-control capacity and increased its border-control staff in recent years.","text - economic and financial environment":"Vietnam is assessed to have one of the highest risks of money laundering and terrorist financing in the world. The country\u2019s economic growth rates, foreign-investment levels, lack of credible regulatory controls and largely cash-based economy makes it susceptible to money laundering. Within the country, local drug lords often control both illicit and licit economic activities through the recruitment and management of businesses via family connections. Additionally, criminal groups involved in human-trafficking and human-smuggling operations are known to provide financial services, or 'shark loans', to victims. Vietnam has promised to improve and cooperate with regional and international agencies on the topic of money laundering. Additionally, the country has introduced collaborative efforts to provide anti-money-laundering guidance to prosecutors and law-enforcement officials. Vietnamese anti-money-laundering legislation also requires businesses in select sectors to participate in anti-money-laundering programmes, and individuals convicted of money laundering may be subjected to imprisonment, fines, bans from government positions and confiscation of property.","text - civil society and social protection":"Vietnam\u2019s anti-trafficking laws contain provisions for victim support, including travel funds, shelter, medical and psychological support, legal aid, educational support and vocational training. However, the country has struggled to put effective measures in place, and has also reduced efforts to support and protect survivors and victims in recent years. Additionally, organizations providing support to human-trafficking victims are not funded by the government, and are often short-staffed, poorly funded and lacking resources. In 2019 the government created a fund to support and encourage law enforcement in crime prevention. Furthermore, it recently made efforts to prevent forestry and wildlife crime, including a partnership aimed at training wildlife-enforcement officers to better understand and address wildlife crime. The Vietnamese Ministry of Education also holds awareness campaigns in schools and universities against 'social evils'. However, this narrative engenders a stigma against people who use drugs and victims of human trafficking. Vietnam also lacks a whistle-blower protection programme. ##&& Meanwhile, Vietnam\u2019s civil society is underdeveloped due to its single-party system. Non-state actors operate under strict government surveillance and are reluctant to criticize government activities. As far as the media is concerned, Vietnam has one of the harshest environments in Asia, with all media outlets either entirely or partially state owned. A cybersecurity law enacted in 2019 requiring social media companies to remove any content deemed \u2018toxic\u2019 by the government is among the latest steps taken by the Vietnamese state to crack down on free speech and freedom of the press in the country. Bloggers and independent journalists are subject to censorship and imprisonment. Vietnam is also one of Asia\u2019s most prolific jailers of peaceful activists, with activists routinely charged under laws that prohibit activities opposing the government.

United Arab Emirates (UAE) influence has also resulted in a new trafficking market in southern Yemen. Furthermore, organ trafficking from Yemen to Egypt is worsened by poverty and extortion. Profits are shared by hospitals, networks and mediators, and some Yemeni hospitals secretly conduct organ transplants. Yemeni children are also victims of trafficking, forced into temporary marriages, commercial sex tourism domestically and in Saudi Arabia, and used as child soldiers. Children collected by Saudi gangs are sent under military escort to the Gulf, and subjected to involuntary domestic service, begging, or drug smuggling into Saudi Arabia. ##&& Yemen is also a source, transit and destination for human smuggling.

Small arms sale, including coalition weaponry, thrives on social media, and the military, security forces, navy, and coast guard are accused of illegal arms shipments and facilitating black-market smuggling. The Houthis (an Islamic armed political movement), STC, and IRG have historically collaborated on arms trafficking, and battlefield exchanges or sales between factions have occurred. Before the conflict, Yemen was a transit hub for East African and Gulf weapons, and weapons are now smuggled via Yemen into Palestine, Sudan and Somalia. An active weapons trade also exists between al-Qaeda factions, and Iranian weaponry, including drone technology, is smuggled to the Houthis.","text - environment":"Fauna trafficking is a significant issue in Yemen, and although flora crime is comparatively unsubstantial, alleged smuggling of the Socotra Island\u2019s endemic dragon tree by UAE-related actors is a source of tension. With regard to fauna, Yemen is a transit country for African wildlife, such as cheetahs, destined for wealthy consumers in the Arabian Peninsula. Deer, hyenas, monkeys and other fauna are also illicitly sold in the country. Yemen is a source and transit hub for endangered and other vulnerable species, including pangolins, Arabian leopards, golden sparrows, blue baboon spiders, Yemen veiled chameleons, falcons, and large cats primarily bred in Yemeni villages for Gulf markets. The market is enabled by corruption and bribery, with traders importing specimens from Djibouti, Somalia and Eritrea. Additionally, illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing depletes fish stocks; although illegal, the market is largely socially accepted. IUU fishing overlaps with more lucrative criminal activities, particularly arms trafficking from Eritrea via fishing boats. ##&& Moreover, the illicit trade of stolen oil is on the rise in Yemen, and Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which once controlled various facilities, has now turned to smuggling. Meanwhile, intra-coalition fighting in southern Yemen focuses on extraction or storage-facility control. Gangs use ground tanks and oil tankers to store and transport oil from government to Houthi areas, resulting in systematic crude-oil looting from state-owned company fields. Illegal oil and gas sales transpire with Houthi and IRG facilitation, with cross-faction collaboration and military-commander involvement. Governorates under Houthi control are also experiencing a gas crisis due to the militia\u2019s black-market trading and selling of gas.","text - drugs":"Conflict has intensified Yemen\u2019s illegal drug trade and increased the border\u2019s porosity. Yemen is a transit country for drugs from the Gulf, Pakistan and Iran, with heroin from Afghanistan sometimes transiting Aden international airport into Egypt. Heroin sales have been increasing in Sana\u2019a, and although the trade is overseen by the Houthi, several routes run exclusively through IRG-controlled territory. Meanwhile, cocaine shipments have been apprehended in deliveries to government agencies, and opportunistic gangs transiting cocaine to Gulf and Arab countries primarily utilize sea routes. ##&& Yemen is also a transit country for cannabis from Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa. Sana'a has seen unprecedented cannabis and hashish activity, and seizures are increasing. The Houthi secretly coordinate hashish smuggling with affiliates, in order to preserve their image. However, cannabis may be sidelined by Yemeni-produced khat, which although legal, invites organized-criminal activities and may utilize forced labour. The same networks facilitate khat and small-arms smuggling into Saudi Arabia, and Yemen exports khat to countries with Somali or Yemeni diaspora, the proceeds subsequently being laundered into Yemen through the hawala (money broker) system. Synthetic drug use is also increasing and inexpensive drugs, primarily prescription drugs and Captagon pills, are the most readily available. In Yemen, drugs are used to control and encourage youth involvement in conflict or in political smear campaigns. Although government-affiliated media claim that Houthi funding comes primarily from the drug trade, the Houthi militia have facilitated the disposal of Lebanese Hezbollah drug products, including Captagon.","text - criminal actors":"Large Yemeni tribes engage in banditry, kidnapping, and have significant weapons arsenals, allowing them to act with impunity and dictate their own governance. In northern and eastern Yemen, goods cannot cross territory without tribal permission. Oil- and arms-smuggling networks collaborating with Houthi, IRG, and STC actors share similar mafia-style characteristics, and military brigade commanders provide them with protection or documentation. Gangs and mafias linked to the Houthi militia are involved in arms, oil, drug, and human trafficking, looting, robbery, home raids, and kidnapping. Victims are subjected to violence and are kept in secret prisons while mafia members work as brokers. The Houthi also control cigarette smuggling, and oil companies are owned by Houthi officials or their relatives. Overlapping tribal, government and security membership makes it difficult to surmise the extent of collusion, and state actors involved in peace negotiations may have links to criminal markets, ignoring illicit practices to ensure constituent loyalty. ##&& Loose criminal networks involved in arms trafficking, human trafficking and human smuggling may also have mafia ties. With regard to the latter two, individuals from Somalia and Ethiopia act as facilitators and brokers, while Saudi members, as well as Saudi-residing Somalis and Ethiopians, receive victims. Meanwhile, Yemeni criminal networks connected to state actors interact with Egyptian organ-harvesting networks. The black market now encompasses everyday items, and criminal networks are violent and widespread. Yemeni networks with ties to militia and the Horn of Africa collaborate with Saudi traffickers, and these networks are often formed to carry out terrorist activities. Regarding the arms market, Saudi Arabia supplies the IRG, the UAE supplies the STC, and Iranian actors, while also involved in drug trafficking, supply the Houthis.","text - leadership and governance":"Yemen is considered one of the world\u2019s most fragile and corrupt states. State institutions, plagued by corruption, bribery, and cronyism, lack capacity and rely on UN funding. This is exacerbated by the government\u2019s security approach and the lack of IRG popular support and influence. The war has damaged infrastructure and facilitated organized crime, and although the supreme national authority for combating corruption was established before the conflict, even then it lacked capacity. The security sector has long suffered from corruption, including ghost soldiers, preferential treatment, and the distribution of military commands for political gain. A 2019 decision facilitating oil trade by commercial companies affiliated with Houthi loyalists, resulted in financial losses for the state oil company, oil derivative purchases by fictitious companies, black-market expansion, and economic crisis. While access to information is fairly robust, monitoring, compliance, anti-corruption and transparency efforts have stalled. Nevertheless, the 2020 IRG and STC Riyadh agreement contained clauses regarding corruption reduction. ##&& Yemen is party to international and regional agreements regarding organized crime, corruption, drug and arms trade, wildlife crime, and terrorism financing, also covered by domestic law. Despite expressing reservations regarding arbitration and extradition, Yemen has an extradition agreement with Egypt and a judicial cooperation agreement and protocol with Tunisia. The IRG occasionally collaborates with UN human-rights mechanisms, and the US supports the coast guard with training and equipment. Due to the fragile political situation, the government has faced internal security threats, weak institutions, law-enforcement and economic challenges, and systemic corruption. Although the penal code criminalizes slavery and child sex trafficking, it excludes sex trafficking as understood within international law, and despite efforts to combat trafficking and protect victims, laws are not enforced.","text - criminal justice and security":"Yemen lacks a comprehensive justice system, adequate courts, judges, staff and training, and no units focus specifically on organized crime. There is no monitoring mechanism and the transition to a paid system has increased corruption. Data is further skewed by the stigma regarding the arrest of women and the categorization of most violent crimes as politically motivated. The government lacks control over the court and prison systems, and by law, parties may settle informally outside of court. Most prisoners are pre-trial detainees, and conditions do not meet international standards due to overcrowding, lack of prison staff training, ineffective case management, underfunding, poor sanitation, inadequate access to justice, the intermingling of pre-trial and convicted inmates, and deteriorating infrastructure. Houthi-affiliated tribal militias operate prison facilities with unknown conditions, and sexual exploitation is common in Sana\u2019a prisons. While the Houthi militia arrests critics and subjects some to forced migration, others are held in secret UAE jails in Yemen and tortured. ##&& The military characteristics and criminal opportunism of policing structures has resulted in decreased public trust. Due to the conflict, resources have shifted, and military capabilities have been exhausted. Despite abetting crime, security officials benefit from impunity, and officers responsible for investigating organized crime have been involved in repressing peaceful demonstrations. Polarization and multiple loyalties exist, based on party, sectarian, regional and tribal affiliations. Territorial integrity is challenged by the conflict between the North and the South, ongoing counterterrorism campaigns against AQAP, tribal issues, extensive borders, and US drone attacks. Moreover, Yemen\u2019s eastern governorate faces destabilization due to the geopolitical struggle between the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, and Yemen\u2019s proximity to Africa makes maritime routes viable for organized crime. The interior of the country is difficult to police, but as a result of a Yemeni\u2013US\u2013Saudi initiative, the border guard situation has improved, particularly in performing checkpoints, patrols, advanced methods of inspection, and confiscation.","text - economic and financial environment":"Yemen is one of the most at-risk countries for money laundering and terrorist financing. Although laws and institutions exist to combat both, efforts are hindered by conflict, poor financial policies and low commitment to international standards. Control of the Central Bank has been fought over by the Houthis and the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, and the hawala system lacks formal oversight and is used for both legitimate and illegitimate transactions. Yemen's informal economy is significant, and agriculture is the country\u2019s largest employment sector. Yemen's economy has been dependent on the oil sector since the mid-1980s, but the sector faces declining productivity. While mineral ore reserves are still significant, the sector lacks investment, and Yemen depends heavily on aid. Doing business in Yemen is extremely difficult, due in part to regulatory deficiencies, and competing Central Banks undermine the IRG\u2019s ability to regulate the economy. The Houthis have also enacted a tax regime, resulting in a continued stream of income.","text - civil society and social protection":"A pattern of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances has occurred in Yemen. Those targeted suffer torture, ill treatment, are denied access to lawyers and their family, and many detainees are held in secret. The killing of several preachers prompted others to flee, and Houthi militants are accused of hostage-taking, torture, and abuse. The government lacks capacity to protect trafficking victims, who are often incarcerated or deported. Furthermore, Yemen lacks specialized centres for drug-addiction treatment or meaningful crime-prevention measures. The non-governmental organization community within Yemen suffers due to the ongoing conflict, but some organizations have sought to shed light on organized crime. Tribes are involved in security provision, rule of law and justice, but their role in countering rather than enabling organized crime is ambiguous. Press freedom has been curtailed by all parties, and the Houthis have blocked online access, with several online newspapers being restricted to disseminating information via social media. Journalists are subjected to abduction, incarceration without trial, arbitrary detention, threats of kidnapping, arrest, torture, the blocking of news sites, and salary suspension.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Sanaa","GDP (current $US million)":"22581.08","Income group":"Low income","Population":"29161922","Land Area (sq. km)":"527970","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"111.7","Freedom in the World Index":"11","Human Development Index":"0.47","Global Peace Index":"3.41","Democracy Index":"1.95","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"15","GDP per capita (current US$)":"774","1":"6.13","1.1":"5.00","1.2":"7.25","2":"2.00"}],"1":"5.30","1.1":"5.21","1.1.1":"6.63","1.1.2":"5.67","1.1.3":"5.21","1.1.4":"4.32","1.1.5":"5.32","1.1.6":"5.35","1.1.7":"5.29","1.1.8":"3.22","1.1.9":"5.08","1.1.10":"6.02","1.2":"5.39","1.2.1":"4.34","1.2.2":"5.62","1.2.3":"6.46","1.2.4":"5.12","2":"4.46","2.1":"4.32","2.2":"3.99","2.3":"5.27","2.4":"4.95","2.5":"4.03","2.6":"4.58","2.7":"4.70","2.8":"4.47","2.9":"4.60","2.10":"4.13","2.11":"4.42","2.12":"4.10"},"europe":{"Continent":"Europe","Population":745567591,"Land Area (sq. km)":23337816,"GDP (current $US million)":21638752.950000003,"children":[{"Corresp":"2","ISO-3":"ALB","Country":"Albania","ISO-2":"AL","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Central & Eastern Europe","Flag file":"al.png","1.

Albania is also a destination country for human trafficking with some irregular migrants from Asia subjected to forced labour in the country. Domestic trafficking of women for sexual exploitation continues, albeit on a smaller scale than it once was. ##&& Albania serves primarily as a transit country for the smuggling of migrants from the Middle East and North Africa who travel through Greece and Montenegro, on their way to Western or Northern Europe. Albanian organized crime groups are involved in both international and domestic human smuggling operations and cooperate with human smugglers in surrounding countries to facilitate the journeys.","text - trade":"Compared to other Balkan states, arms trafficking is relatively limited in Albania, and there is no arms or ammunition production. However, there are still arms remaining from the civil unrest in Albania in 1997, creating the foundation for a limited criminal market in small arms, light weapons and dismantled weapon parts. Many of these small arms and light weapons (SALW) are destined for other European markets, but some appear to be sold on the domestic market as well. Arms trafficking routes from Albania to EU countries are either inland, moving north through the Balkans or Greece, or seaborne to Western Europe. Within Albania, the criminal market for SALW is mainly controlled by criminal networks from the country's northern regions.","text - environment":"Although there is evidence of a decline in recent years, environmental criminal markets persist for both flora and fauna, as well as non-renewable natural resources. Illegal logging is an issue and is particularly widespread in the district of Elbasan and the southern district of Vlora. A 10-year export ban was imposed in 2016 and successfully curbed some illegal logging. However, it also created opportunities for small, well-organized criminal groups in Kosovo and Montenegro to smuggle illicit timber into and from Albania, causing illegal logging in border areas, where mountainous terrain makes it difficult for the police to contain the activity. ##&& Illegal trade in birds, brown bears and wolves is believed to be a relatively common form of wildlife crime in Albania, with many protected species and other wildlife traded online or in shops. Furthermore, although a nationwide hunting ban has sought to limit it, poaching continues. Similarly, though it does not constitute a major criminal market, the illegal extraction of natural resources, such as chrome, remains an issue. An oil-producing country, Albania is home to a small but significant market for illegal oil extraction, which is facilitated by corrupt practices on the part of state officials. While the market does not involve major organized crime groups, there are reportedly links between the latter and state officials.","text - drugs":"Albania is a key transit country for heroin, as well as cocaine trafficked from Latin America. Albanian criminal actors also play central roles in Europe\u2019s heroin and cocaine markets. Mafia-style groups have formed associations with South American cartels, the \u2018Ndrangheta and cocaine producers, allowing them to import vast quantities of high-quality cocaine at competitive prices and giving them access to a complex global infrastructure. Albanian criminal groups, however, are not just engaged in trafficking cocaine to Europe, but are also involved in its storage and distribution, and have increasingly consolidated their influence over wholesalers and retail markets across the continent. As a result, Albanian organized criminals have come to control a significant share of Europe\u2019s cocaine trade. ##&& Albania is also a transit country for heroin trafficked to Europe through the Balkan route from Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Trafficking is undertaken by mafia-style actors and criminal networks that are known to cooperate with other criminal actors involved in the heroin supply chain. Most heroin is trafficked into Albania by land, through North Macedonia, but heroin-processing laboratories have also been uncovered internally by Albanian police. ##&& Albania has been one of the largest producers of cannabis in Europe for at least a decade. In recent years, however, cultivation has declined drastically, largely due to police intervention, the destruction of plantations, and state efforts to change the business model. Nevertheless, stockpiles remain and, for now, Albania continues to be a significant source of cannabis for the EU, with the drug reportedly transported by sea via Italy and by land through Greece and Montenegro. The criminal market for synthetic drugs in Albania is the smallest of the drug markets in the country. Synthetic drugs are imported into Albania primarily from neighbouring countries, such as Serbia and Bulgaria, as well as various EU countries. In general, while cannabis appears to be relatively widely consumed domestically, consumption rates of harder drugs are low in Albania.","text - criminal actors":"Albania\u2019s criminal ecosystem is dominated by overlapping criminal networks and family mafia-style actors. Mafia-style groups control the criminal markets for drugs, human trafficking, human smuggling and are reportedly moving into public procurement. They have positioned themselves as some of the most powerful criminal organizations in Europe. Albanian mafia-style groups differ from other major mafias (such as the Italian), in that they rarely identify themselves with names or symbols. With that said, Albanian groups exhibit a clear structure and loyalty to a single leader. They collude with state-embedded actors and are able to influence elections by pushing votes in one direction or the other. Mafia-style groups in Albania also allegedly create smaller, looser criminal networks that gravitate around them. These networks reportedly have a fluid organizational and operational structure and comprise of 3-4 members. They take a pragmatist-driven approach by seizing any opportunity for profit. They are highly violent but cooperate well with corrupt police and judiciary officials as well as with foreign actors, particularly the Sicilian mafia as well as Turkish organized crime groups. They are known to have links to Kosovar and Montenegrin criminal networks and have a strong presence in Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK, among others. Due to specific socio-economic factors, a worrying trend of youth involvement in day-to-day criminal operations in various roles as part of criminal networks is observed. Albanian criminal networks are heavily involved in drug trafficking, especially the cannabis trade. They often pose as legal businesses to operate and different members are responsible for specific tasks within the organization, such as securing, transporting, distributing drugs, etc. ##&& State-embedded actors also feature heavily in the criminal landscape of the country. Reportedly, crime group members have been appointed to political positions at various levels within the state apparatus. Criminal networks are highly embedded in local- and regional-level structures and operate with the police and receive political protection. Foreign actors also function within Albania but are less influential than domestic groups. Turkish crime groups for one are mainly involved in heroin trafficking, while Italian groups are influential in the southern part of the country. There is evidence that Albanian organized criminals interact with foreign crime groups from Kosovo and Montenegro, as well as South and Central American cartels.","text - leadership and governance":"Albania is an unconsolidated democracy where checks and balances on power structures are not always adequately ensured and often result in weak institutional capacity. Criminal state capture has reduced the state\u2019s ability to tackle organized crime. Under pressure from the European Union, the Albanian government has placed corruption and organized crime high on the political agenda, and a comprehensive judicial and anti-corruption reform programme is currently in implementation. Nevertheless, this process is slow, and the political environment remains characterized by polarization, frequent crises and persistent grand corruption. ##&& Albania's legal framework on international judicial cooperation in criminal matters is well established, and Albanian law enforcement has partnered with various institutions at international and regional levels. Albania is a member of INTERPOL and a partner of the European Judicial Network; it has signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Europol; and is part of various regional law enforcement networks. Albania also has several extradition agreements in place and has ratified nearly all relevant organized crime treaties. Overall, Albania has a fairly robust legislative framework to address organized crime. However, enforcement of this legal framework often falls short.","text - criminal justice and security":"Independence and capacity in Albania\u2019s judiciary are lacking, and corruption often undermines the integrity of the criminal justice system. The Albanian government is currently implementing a comprehensive justice reform package aimed at substantially strengthening the judicial system and the institutional safeguards against corruption. However, due to the scale and ambition of the judicial reforms, as well as delays, the country has at times lacked a functioning Constitutional Court. And because all judges have to go through an extensive vetting process, there is a severe backlog of cases. Detention facilities in Albania are reportedly lacking in quality, with accounts of abuse within Albanian prisons. Because of inadequate resources, low salaries, limited equipment, high turnover of staff, as well as corruption, the Albanian law enforcement\u2019s response to organized crime is often delayed and inadequate. Whereas some criminal groups have been effectively dismantled and results have been achieved, investigations and prosecutions often fail to target the upper echelons of criminal organizations, and the number of final convictions is limited. Overall, this translates into little progress being made in the fight against organized crime.","text - economic and financial environment":"Albania is one of the poorest countries in Europe, and its social and economic policies have failed to generate sufficient employment, which may push people towards organized crime. At least a third of the country\u2019s GDP is thought to come from the informal economy, which, besides causing loss of tax revenue, makes the introduction of labour protection and competition rules difficult. The lack of contract enforcement, along with unclear property rights and the prevalence of corruption are also major constraints to private sector development. Corruption, weak regulatory frameworks and a significant informal economy render Albania vulnerable to money laundering. As a significant percentage of the country\u2019s economy is informal, the number of detected money laundering cases is low. Outside of the informal economy, many large-scale money-laundering projects are set up as prestigious public\u2013private infrastructure projects, such as football stadiums, theatres and malls. Such large-scale projects often involve corrupt Albanian politicians and international \u2018starchitects\u2019, indicating the extent to which organized crime is able to capture state institutions. ##&& Albanian police have approved a new action plan aimed at tackling money laundering, criminal assets and unjustified wealth. Moreover, under amendments to the country's anti-mafia law, tools have been developed for freezing, handling and confiscating criminal assets. However, implementation remains a significant challenge, particularly with regard to the confiscation of sequestered assets. Albania was grey-listed by the Financial Action Task Force in early 2020 due to its inability to address strategic deficiencies in its anti-money laundering regime.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Albanian government has made significant progress in passing legislation that meets international standards, on the status and treatment of victims of crime. Nevertheless, challenges persist at the implementation level. There is lack of support programmes to ensure medical, psychological and social assistance to victims of crime, and only a limited number of public and private actors are involved in offering such services. Moreover, the country lacks an integrated victim support system, and victim and witness assassinations are not unheard of. Strong ties between mafia-style organizations and the Albanian legislature and law enforcement agencies often put witnesses in danger. As a result, many witnesses have been forced to skip court hearings and refrain from testifying. Legal aid schemes need to develop outreach mechanisms and access to protection services. Civil society organizations (CSOs) with donor support remain the primary providers of aid for most cases involving vulnerable groups, rather than by government agencies. ##&& The culture of crime prevention in Albania is relatively underdeveloped. Although legislation and law enforcement mechanisms do exist, prevention mechanisms are ineffective and lack creativity regarding engagement with citizens to prevent criminal activity from occurring in the first place. Additional prevention programmes must be established. Civil society and media engagement in countering organized crime is limited. Many civil society organizations are dependent on external donors for financial support while public funding for CSOs is minimal and not yet legally regulated. Press freedom is generally respected, but few media outlets in Albania enjoy financial and editorial independence, and many politicians use rhetoric that is not conducive to a free and independent media environment.

While non-renewable resource crimes are not overly present in Andorra, the trafficking and laundering of precious metals and minerals does occur, albeit on a small scale. Jewellery is one of Andorra\u2019s most significant commercial sectors, and several cases have been recorded of Andorran citizens being involved in the illicit trafficking of gold and diamonds. Additionally, illegally mined gold in France has allegedly been smuggled into Andorra and sold. The country was once considered a tax haven, which has probably increased the likelihood of the existence of money laundering schemes related to the trade in natural resources. Overall, evidence suggests that the criminal market for non-renewable resources in Andorra is limited. However, as gold and diamonds act as facilitating products for money laundering, there may be a larger market than realized.","text - drugs":"Illicit drug trafficking does not pose a substantive threat to Andorra as the local consumption of narcotics is low and drug traffickers in the region prefer more accessible routes through the ports of Perpignan and Biarritz in France and through ports in Spain. However, there are recorded cases of heroin being trafficked into Andorra, mainly involving loose criminal networks. Based on seizure statistics, it is likely that there is a larger market for cocaine than heroin. Most seizures, however, are from Spanish and French tourists, as well as from other non-residents who intend using the drug for personal consumption. Nevertheless, large quantities of cocaine destined for local markets have also been seized. ##&& The local production of cannabis has increased in recent years, as have cannabis imports from neighbouring countries. Cannabis appears to be smuggled mostly from Spain and to a lesser extent from France, predominantly by criminal networks consisting mainly of Andorran residents. Trafficking routes reportedly go through official checkpoints and the mountainous terrain between borders. The synthetic drug market appears to be small, with sources close to the police reporting a decrease in synthetic drug use. Synthetic drugs are nevertheless trafficked into Andorra, coming primarily from Northern Europe in cocaine and cannabis shipments.","text - criminal actors":"The most prominent criminal groups in Andorra appear to be made up of foreign criminal actors. Many foreign criminal actors are involved in money laundering in the country. In addition, criminal organizations from Russian-speaking countries and the Balkans are involved primarily in serial burglaries and damage to property. Groups of jewellery thieves from Serbia (the Pink Panthers) and China (the Pink Pandas) operate in Andorra as well. There have also been registered cases of human smuggling perpetrated by Chinese criminal organizations. The criminal networks operating in Andorra are market-specific and involved predominantly in the drug trade. Information suggests that there is cooperation between local criminal actors and foreign criminal networks (for example, networks operating in France). ##&& State-embedded actors are not generally involved in transnational criminal activity, although there may be occasional cooperation between organized crime groups and officials in certain transactions. There is no information that any mafia-style groups operate in Andorra.","text - leadership and governance":"Although there is not much evidence of organized crime in Andorra, the country puts emphasis on developing and implementing prevention strategies. It has also committed to fighting drug trafficking and the selling of cannabis-related substances to underage youth.

However, in 2015 the international community raised organized crime in Andorra as an issue when the Banca Privada d\u2019Andorra (BPA) was implicated in money laundering on behalf of organized-crime groups. Transparency in the country is observed, with the government publishing its budget as well as information on the clearance of its accounts. In 2019 it put forward a law to promote transparency in public administration, but while the bill proposes that officials declare their assets upon taking and leaving public office, the provisions do not bind them to adhere to this measure. ##&& Andorra generally complies with international standards in regard to fighting organized crime, and collaborates successfully with international institutions and mechanisms. Andorra has effective bilateral agreements, including cooperation protocols, with the Spanish police, and more effective cooperation protocols with France are in development. In regard to extradition, Andorra adheres to the European Convention on Extradition, drawn up in 1957 by the Council of Europe. Due to its history of money laundering and tax evasion, Andorra approved a law in 2017 which reinforced their criminalization. Because it has a low criminality rate, the country\u2019s legal framework for organized crime appears sufficient.","text - criminal justice and security":"In the wake of the BPA scandal, the Andorran judiciary established a new unit to tackle organized crime.

Andorra has a Criminal Police International Cooperation Department within its Police Corps, which encompasses INTERPOL\u2019s National Central Bureau in the country. This unit focuses specifically on issues related to organized crime and shares intelligence with its partner countries. Additionally, Division III: Judicial Police and Criminal Investigation, a unit within the Directorate of the Police, has specialized sections on drug trafficking, money laundering and organized crime. While law enforcement measures have improved, the implementation of anti-crime measures is poor, especially insofar as money laundering offences are concerned. There are close relationships between the Andorran and Spanish authorities; however, Andorra\u2019s relationship with the French police and customs agents is less developed, a situation that has resulted in more illicit cross-border activities, such as arms and cigarette trafficking. Nevertheless, the geographic and topographic features of the country along with the lack of an international airport and port deem it less vulnerable than other countries in the region.","text - economic and financial environment":"Andorra used to be considered a tax haven and has a history of large-scale money laundering operations permeating the legal economy. Following the BPA scandal, however, the regulatory and institutional framework was reformed to meet international standards. The country has a financial intelligence unit, which is dedicated to implementing legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorism financing and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Due to external pressures in the wake of the 2015 scandal, Andorra eased its bank-secrecy laws and now complies with international standards on economic regulation. The economic environment allows for the expansion of legitimate businesses, and regulations have been introduced with the intention of creating a modern, transparent and internationally comparable regulatory framework that will attract both foreign investors and legitimate businesses.","text - civil society and social protection":"There is a specialized service for victims of human trafficking in Andorra, even though no cases of trafficking have been reported. No information is available regarding witness protection programmes, but Andorra\u2019s low organized crime rate suggests that these may not be a priority. There is an emphasis on prevention strategies aimed at tackling organized crime, the most substantial one being related to drug use prevention. There are also departments within the police force and the country\u2019s mental health centre that focus respectively on prevention and social orientation, as well as on addiction treatments. Prevention strategies have also been implemented in relation to robbery, child abuse and cybercrime. ##&& Andorran journalists and media houses are free to report on news related to organized crime without fear of prosecution or retaliation. Media outlets are reportedly dependent on political, business and religious interests, which heavily influence coverage. Conflicts of interest between these stakeholders, along with the level of difficulty associated with reporting on the activities of banks in the country, are among the biggest problems that journalists face.","Number of pages":"3","Capital":"Andorra La Valla","GDP (current $US million)":"3154.06","Income group":"High income","Population":"77142","Land Area (sq. km)":"470","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"","Freedom in the World Index":"93","Human Development Index":"0.87","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"","Regime Type":"","Corruption Perceptions Index":"","GDP per capita (current US$)":"40886","1":"2.97","1.1":"2.55","1.2":"3.38","2":"7.75"},{"Corresp":"10","ISO-3":"AUT","Country":"Austria","ISO-2":"AT","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Western Europe","Flag file":"at.png","1.

The criminal market in human trafficking is dominated by foreign criminal actors, including eastern European and Nigerian mafias that are part of global networks. While the number of identified domestic trafficking victims in Austria has decreased, available evidence suggests that most victims of sex trafficking are young women from Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Nigeria and China. Recently, a new trend has been observed, where Venezuelan nationals are getting involved in the market, both as perpetrators and as victims. Many of these victims have been lured into trafficking under the guise of more licit forms of employment opportunities. In addition to sex trafficking, there is evidence of a large, potentially expanding market for labour trafficking. ##&& Austria is both a destination country for human smuggling and a transit country for migrants en route to northern Europe. Both foreign and local actors operate within this criminal market, with reports indicating that Austrian nationals are recruited by transnational criminal organizations. Irregular migrants entering Austria have previously transited through Italy, travelling via the central Mediterranean route, or the Western Balkans, moving via the Balkan route.","text - trade":"Located at the cross-section of Western, Eastern and Southern Europe, Austria is a hub for arms trafficking. The Austrian criminal market for the illicit trade of firearms is relatively sizeable, and Austria is considered both a destination, transit as well as a source country for illegal firearms. Austria has one of the highest rates of registered gun ownership in Europe and is a major exporter of firearms. There is also a significant number of unregistered and illegal firearms in the country and firearms are relatively easy to obtain in Austria. Some of these illegal arms may be trafficked abroad, and illegal firearms seized in Brazil have been reported to come from Austria. At the same time, illegal arms are known to be imported from the Western Balkans, suggesting that the criminal market in Austria consists of arms of both foreign and domestic origin. The criminal market for arms trafficking in Austria is heavily linked to organized crime groups that often participate in numerous other illicit activities, such as the illicit drug and prostitution markets. In particular, Italian mafia-style groups, namely the 'Ndrangheta and Camorra, are involved in arms trafficking to, from and through Austria, but there are suggestions that Chechen, Georgian, Balkan and Turkish crime groups are also active in the trade.","text - environment":"Although environmental crimes are known to occur, markets for this in Austria are limited in scale and scope. There is evidence of small imports of illegal timber into Austria from Ukraine, Russia, Slovakia, Indonesia and in particular, Romania. On a number of occasions, Austrian timber companies have been exposed for their involvement in illegal logging operations in other countries. With regard to fauna crimes, Austria is a destination and transit country for illegal reptiles. A small number of Austrians are involved in supplying the transnational illegal reptile trade by collaborating with collectors and supplying pet markets in Austria and various connected Western European countries. The hunting of protected raptors remains problematic and there is some evidence of trade in poached mammals, birds and reptiles. Reports have indicated that crude oil has been illegally imported in Austria, but evidence for the existence of a larger non-renewable resource crimes market is negligible.","text - drugs":"Austria plays a role as a transit point in the transnational drug trade, but is predominantly a destination country for drugs such as cocaine, heroin, cannabis and various types of synthetic drugs. The most consumed and confiscated drug in the country is cannabis. Austria is mainly a destination and transit country for cannabis, with limited domestic production. A significant amount of Austria\u2019s cannabis supply comes from the Western Balkans and Morocco. This cannabis is trafficked mostly by mafia-style groups with roots in the Balkans. In addition to imported cannabis, Austria has a supplementary supply of domestically cultivated cannabis which appears to be distributed by domestic networks. Cocaine seizures have increased in the last few years and evidence suggests that cocaine consumption rates are currently rising. Cocaine is imported from Latin America via Spain, the Netherlands and the Balkans, sometimes arriving at the Vienna International Airport. Foreign criminal groups in collaboration with domestic actors are believed to be responsible for most of the trafficking of cocaine into Austria. ##&& Austria is both a destination country and a transit point for heroin trafficked via the Balkan route. Foreign mafia-style groups based in the Balkans with links to various other destinations in Europe (particularly the Netherlands) and in Africa are responsible for most heroin trafficking. Synthetic drug markets in Austria are driven predominantly by domestic demand. Amphetamines and MDMA\/Ecstasy consumed in Austria tend to originate in the Netherlands and Poland, whereas methamphetamines are mainly produced in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In recent years, a number of smaller laboratories used to produce amphetamine and methamphetamine have been dismantled in Austria. However, there is no evidence that domestic production is widespread enough to cover a substantial amount of the market and domestically produced synthetic drugs only supplement foreign supplies. Unlike cannabis, cocaine and heroin, it is not clear what criminal actors are responsible for servicing the market in synthetic drugs. One reason for this is that a significant amount of trade is occurring over the darknet.","text - criminal actors":"The Austrian criminal ecosystem is dominated by foreign actors, and many criminal markets in Austria are controlled or influenced by transnational criminal groups. Most foreign actors with a sustained presence inside Austria are pseudo-legitimate international \u2018rocker\u2019 associations, which are involved in the largest Austrian criminal markets (drug trafficking, sexual exploitation and the illicit arms trade). These include the United Tribuns, Osmanen Germania, Hells Angels and Satudarah, which have their origins in other European countries, with established \u2018chapters\u2019 in Austria. These groups are mainly formed by foreign nationals, whereas Austrian citizens carry out supplementary tasks. Behind the scenes, however, some of the country\u2019s most prominent criminal actors are mafia-style groups of Balkan, Turkish, Arabic, Russian, Nigerian, Chinese, Chechen and Italian origins. The criminal groups from the Balkans are involved in human trafficking and smuggling, in addition to drugs and arms trafficking to Austria and northern Europe; Nigerian and Chinese mafias are involved in trafficking for sexual exploitation to Austria, as well as in the drug trade, while the Chechen mafia is involved in arms trafficking. Italian mafias such as the Camorra and the 'Ndrangheta are involved in drug trafficking, financial crimes, illegal gambling and money-laundering through the establishment of legal businesses in Austria. In addition to foreign criminal actors, small local criminal networks, seeking foreign collaboration, are active on the Austrian drug market, especially the cannabis trade. These networks are also involved in human smuggling and trafficking, as well as in the trafficking of firearms. ##&& Although state-embedded actors do not facilitate criminal markets on an organized basis, there have been cases of money-laundering, illicit public procurements, and corruption within the government. There is no evidence for the existence of domestic mafia-style groups in Austria.","text - leadership and governance":"The current Austrian government has shown commitment and leadership in the fight against organized crime. Levels of corruption in the country continue to be fairly low and safeguards against corruption are effective in most areas. However, recent high-level corruption cases have exposed vulnerabilities to Austria\u2019s political integrity, and the legal and institutional anti-corruption framework has some deficiencies when it comes to access to information and enforcing integrity measures at the political level. ##&& The Austrian government has shown commitment to international cooperation against organized crime and is party to most relevant anti-organized crime treaties, including the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, its three protocols and the UN Convention against Corruption. It has established a Joint Operation Office within the Criminal Intelligence Service to reinforce international cooperation and intelligence exchange and is a member of a European information exchange platform to combat illegal wildlife trade. In addition to the European Convention on Extradition, Austria has extradition agreements with Switzerland and the USA. The Austrian penal code criminalizes the establishment of, and participation in, a criminal association engaged in any of the criminal markets. The penal code also includes provisions against human trafficking, human smuggling, the illegal trafficking of military weapons, nuclear and radioactive material, dangerous waste, counterfeit money or drugs as well as a range of corruption offences such as active and passive bribery, embezzlement and fraud. Additionally, Austria\u2019s anti-organized crime legal framework contains a number of acts that provide provisions against human smuggling and drug trafficking.","text - criminal justice and security":"Austria\u2019s judiciary is independent and efficient and criminal justice matters are handled fairly. Furthermore, within the judiciary exists a specialized anti-corruption unit, the Public Prosecutor's Office for White-Collar Crime and Corruption, which deals with financial crimes, the falsification of governmental budgets, state-embedded bribery and organized crime-related corruption cases. Prisons in Austria are of a high standard, are equipped with the necessary security infrastructure and provide a range of services aimed at rehabilitating offenders into society. Austria\u2019s law enforcement agencies house several units specifically tasked with countering organized crime. Within the Austrian Crime Intelligence Federal Agency, the Bundeskriminalamt, a number of specialized bureaus have been established. These include a bureau against corruption, a Federal Bureau Against Organized Crime, and a bureau that specializes in human smuggling and human trafficking. While this makes for what appears to be a relatively strong framework for criminal justice, Austria\u2019s position along major drug, arms and human trafficking routes in Europe continues to expose the country to illicit flows.","text - economic and financial environment":"Austria\u2019s economic and regulatory environment is conducive to doing business and the Austrian economy is open and diverse. There are, however, constraints to economic opportunities with a bureaucratic process that makes starting a business time-consuming. Overall, Austria is resilient to money laundering and terrorist financing, but systemic issues remain. Austria is considered a hub for money laundering between western and eastern Europe, with money from Russia and Ukraine flowing to and through banks in Vienna. Numerous businesspeople from eastern Europe, often involved in larger criminal networks, hold bank accounts, company investments, and real estate in the country. Historically, beneficial ownership transparency has been lacking in Austria, and the government has been hesitant to introduce reforms that could limit the inflow of dirty money into the country. However, while there is still a conducive environment for illicit financial flows in Austria, recent years have seen the implementation of key reforms that create some progress in the area of fiscal transparency and make it more difficult for dirty money to infiltrate Austria.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim support mechanisms in Austria are fairly robust by standards, particularly when it comes to providing services to victims of modern slavery. Although the state takes the lead, it is often supported by civil society - particularly in the area of human trafficking and the rehabilitation of drug users. Victim-support organizations include a variety of government-funded civil society organizations that provide victims of trafficking and smuggling with a range of services, including help in finding accommodation, employment, medical care and psychological counselling. For the most part, Austrian society considers and treats drug addiction as a health condition. There are several institutions that specialize in the medical and psychological care of people who use drugs and there is a coordination centre focusing on care, prevention and social reintegration. Numerous civil society organizations are active in drug prevention and in carrying out awareness and sensitization campaigns as well as offering psychological support. Additionally, the government and law enforcement have been adopting crime-preventive initiatives. The Bundeskriminalamt has established a Bureau for Crime Prevention Staff and has launched a series of initiatives to establish security partnerships between citizens, police and local government. Austria also takes part in the European Crime Prevention Network. ##&& Austria's media environment is considered free and does not seem to be affected by any restriction to freedom of expression. However, in recent years, the rise of populist politics in Austria has been associated with diminishing press freedom and accusations of extremism levelled against critical journalists.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Vienna","GDP (current $US million)":"445075.39","Income group":"High income","Population":"8879920","Land Area (sq. km)":"83879","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"26.1","Freedom in the World Index":"93","Human Development Index":"0.92","Global Peace Index":"1.28","Democracy Index":"8.16","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"76","GDP per capita (current US$)":"50122","1":"4.04","1.1":"3.95","1.2":"4.13","2":"7.42"},{"Corresp":"16","ISO-3":"BLR","Country":"Belarus","ISO-2":"BY","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Central & Eastern Europe","Flag file":"by.png","1.

Over the same period, the number of identified Belarusian human trafficking victims has decreased. Trafficking victims are primarily men who are subjected to labour exploitation in the Russian Federation. Meanwhile, Belarusian women who travel to work in the hotel or adult entertainment industries are subjected to sex trafficking. Human trafficking in Belarus appears to be carried out by a mix of individuals, mafia-style criminal groups, international criminal networks and state-embedded actors, such as low-level customs and border officials. There is a possibility that escort prostitution may increase due to limited work prospects and the introduction of simplified visa procedures from EU countries.","text - trade":"Belarus appears to be a source and transit country for illicit arms. The market is mainly structured around illegal arms stolen from former Soviet stockpiles, illicit flows from Ukraine distributed in Russia due to weak border controls, and\/or illicit arms transported into the rest of Europe via Poland, in collaboration with Polish organized crime groups. There is also significant evidence of state facilitated arms trafficking into conflict zones or countries under sanctions. Additionally, the ongoing war in Ukraine remains a destabilizing factor in the proliferation of arms, with arms that are trafficked from Ukraine to Belarus usually crossing via the Chernihiv or Kyiv routes. Overall, the arms trade is a significant source of income for Belarus.","text - environment":"Flora crimes in Belarus are generally limited to cases of illegal logging that involve locals who need fuel. Perpetrators are often legitimate businesses that fell more trees than is legally allowed. Organized crime groups are present only to a limited extent. While there are no significant flows out of the country, if any market exists, it is of a small scale with Belarus serving as a source and transit country. Meanwhile, there are indications that Belarus acts as a transit for illegal wildlife trafficked from Poland to Russia, and possibly Ukraine. Experts have also speculated that animals may have been destined for medicinal markets in Asia. ##&& In terms of non-renewable resource crimes, most are related to the illegal mining of sand and small-scale amber excavation. Irregular migrants carry out large-scale work, with possible links to human trafficking. Additionally, with a highly developed shadow economy and high rates of corruption, Minsk is said to be following the \u2018amber fever\u2019 in Ukraine, where government forces struggle to contain amber mafias. Similarly, coal from the Donbas is reportedly smuggled via the Russian Federation through Belarus and into the EU. Additionally, since the large-scale excavation of sand is labour-intensive and requires large machines, it is likely that groups involved possess equipment or are supported by companies owning the necessary machinery \u2013 indicating a mafia-style organization. Belarus has also been suspected, by Russian officials, of avoiding export duties on petroleum products by shipping them under different names.","text - drugs":"Cannabis and synthetic drugs are the most common in Belarus. People growing cannabis for personal use dominate the country\u2019s trade. Meanwhile, any transnational dimension appears to be limited, as local suppliers largely meet domestic demand. Synthetic drugs is the fastest-growing criminal market in Belarus. Local producers, consisting of smaller mafia-style groups, run the market, while larger transnational networks involving foreign producers retail the drugs online. There has been some success in locating stash houses, but authorities struggle to curb the trade.","text - criminal actors":"The frequent recurrence of large-scale, high-level corruption cases involving officials suggests there is a significant connection between criminal markets and state actors. State-embedded actors are responsible for major losses from both national and municipal budgets. Additionally, it is likely that customs and border officials are involved in the trafficking of goods in the region, and the government has been accused of smuggling arms to conflict zones and controversial regimes. Diplomatic cables have also labelled Belarus as a quasi-mafia state, where distinguishing between state and organized crime activities has been impossible. There is a lack of current information on mafia-style groups in Belarus, as a number of former members of mafia-style groups have, since the 1990s, incrementally moved their activities into the legal realm and become public officials and business owners. While active mafia-style groups still exist in various criminal markets, it is likely that they are keeping a low profile due to the harsh punishment and extensive resources spent on policing. ##&& There is evidence that criminal networks in Belarus are involved in drug distribution and trafficking but mostly locally, while activities involving arms and human trafficking networks, as well as those active in cybercrimes, are more international in nature. Connections have also been found between criminal networks and travel agencies to provide fake documents. Nevertheless, there is a lack of information as to the names and defined leadership of criminal networks in the country. Criminal networks in Belarus are closely related to Russian organized crime groups. There is also cooperation with criminal networks from neighbouring countries, as well as other states and regions that do not share borders. Overall, foreign actors are likely active across all criminal markets in Belarus, with most of these engaging in operations using ethnic ties.","text - leadership and governance":"Belarus is characterized as having an authoritarian regime, where despite technically having a democratic process, there is no separation of powers and the president has full executive control and significant legislative power. While there is no proof of direct involvement by the government in \u2018classic\u2019 organized crime activities, there is evidence of practices akin to financial scams. European neighbours, international organizations, and opposition groups have also raised concerns about corruption, violations of human rights, and undemocratic activities in Belarus since the 1990s. The government has introduced laws to combat corruption and declared the fight against corruption the most important priority of the state. At the same time, the government retains power to shut down any corruption-related publications or reports, based on a range of restrictions. Additionally, most political decisions and legislative bodies are controlled and influenced by the presidential administration with no transparency and there is a complete lack of accountability within the security agencies.","text - criminal justice and security":"Belarus\u2019s judicial system lacks independence and is under the strict control of the president, who appoints the majority of judges and has allegedly used the system as a tool to crack down on opponents.

In terms of law enforcement services, Belarus has a ministry of internal affairs, as well as various national bodies responsible for specific aspects of national law enforcement and different types of police, including the organized crime and corruption police. The police force in the country suffers from widespread corruption, inadequate training, resource shortages and poor working conditions. With regards to territorial integrity, Belarus is a transit country for various criminal markets given its geographic location.

Nevertheless, illegally smuggled, foreign-produced arms make up the largest part of the domestic criminal firearms market. Firearms seized in Belgium are primarily from the Balkan region. They are smuggled in by road in cars, as well as in passenger buses and vans, which are used by courier companies. Alternatively, weapons enter the country via the port of Antwerp. In these cases, however, weapons do not seem to be intended for the Belgian market but the country is used to transit the weapons destined for other countries.

Belgium has one of the leading diamond industries in the world and Antwerp is an important hub for the global diamond trade, where several crime groups are active. Diamonds are illegally smuggled into Belgium, then sold in the country and used to launder money. Because of its connections to former African colonies, Belgium has historically played an important role in the ivory trade. The country has stockpiles of ivory and continues to be a transit hub for the illicit trade in wildlife products, including live birds, primate species and ivory, exported from African countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea and Liberia, to Asia, North America and the Middle East. Belgium is a destination country for illegal flora markets, such as plants from Thailand and traditional medicinal herbs from Asia and North America. The port of Antwerp has been a major point of entry for large amounts of illicit timber headed for Europe. Timber is shipped from Central Africa and is imported by a number of Belgian companies.","text - drugs":"In addition to being a destination country, Belgium is one of the most important European transit countries for drugs. It is responsible for a disproportionately large share of Europe\u2019s cocaine seizures. This is largely because Antwerp, Europe\u2019s second-largest port, has emerged as a significant international drug trafficking hub and one of the most important ports of entry for cocaine into Europe. Cocaine, imported in containers entering the port, is predominantly destined for the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. Belgium is a notable source and destination country and transit zone for new psychoactive substances and synthetic drugs. Many of the synthetic drugs are believed to come from China, but the production of synthetic drugs, such as MDMA, commonly known as Ecstasy or molly, amphetamines, ketamine and synthetic cannabinoids are expanding in the Belgian-Dutch border region. Several drug labs and warehouses have been dismantled in recent years. These production and conversion facilities appear to be operated predominantly by Dutch organized-crime groups and there are very links between the Dutch and Belgian crime markets for synthetic drugs. ##&& Belgium is predominantly a destination for heroin and seizures indicate that its markets appear to be relatively sizeable. Heroin destined for Belgium enters the country via the Balkan route, the southern route (transiting in African countries before reaching Europe), or the northern route (transiting in Central Asia and Russia). The country is a producer, consumer and transit country for cannabis destined for markets in other European countries. Most herbal cannabis consumed in Belgium is either cultivated locally or imported from Spain, the Netherlands and some North African countries; cannabis resin comes mostly from Morocco and is trafficked mainly by road through Spain and France. Professional cultivation of cannabis is expanding in Belgium, with some involvement of crime organizations. Criminals from the Netherlands play an important role in the Belgian crime market for cannabis.","text - criminal actors":"A mix of mafia-style groups of foreign and domestic origin, as well as loose networks, are the main actors involved in Belgium\u2019s crime markets. Foreign actors wield considerable influence over the country's organized-crime markets. Notably, Albanian and multiple Italian organized-crime groups are involved in drug trafficking, arms trafficking and human smuggling, frequently in collaboration with Turkish mafia-style groups. Turkish actors are also involved in murder-for-hire against Turkish and Kurdish dissidents. Dutch groups are involved in drug trafficking, cannabis production, import and export, cocaine production and export, and the export of synthetic drugs. They are involved in money laundering and labour exploitation. Romanian organized-crime groups operating in the Belgian market are involved in human trafficking for sexual and labour exploitation. Additionally, Nigerian organized-crime groups are involved in human smuggling which often results in human trafficking. ##&& In addition to these groups, there are numerous 'loose' crime networks in Belgium, supporting drug trafficking, cultivation and production. The networks are relatively widespread but are concentrated more in city areas, such as Brussels and Antwerp, or at the Dutch border. Mafia-style outlaw biker gangs play an important role in crime. These include the Hells Angels, No Surrender, Diablo, MC Mongols, Satudarah MC and the Bandidos.

Under the federal public prosecutor\u2019s office there exists a specific section with jurisdiction over organized-crime matters. Belgium is vulnerable to transnational organized crime, largely because of its geographic position at the heart of Europe. The country\u2019s ports and airports are key transit hubs for illicit products. However, border authorities have sought to strengthen port security in recent years. The country\u2019s law enforcement is made up of federal and local police forces. The federal police carry out expert operations at national and regional levels and support local and federal units. The federal police have a specialized body dedicated to the fight against organized crime. Additionally, there are a number of units specialized in prioritized crime markets, such as human, drug and arms trafficking. The federal public prosecutor\u2019s office contains a dedicated organized-crime section. Facilities in Belgian prisons are generally good and free from abuse and corruption, but there are occasional reports of problematic conditions, such as overcrowding. Belgium reportedly had the most overcrowded prison facilities in the EU, where inmates suffered insufficient access to healthcare and sanitary facilities. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in early, conditional as well as temporary release. This response has, at least temporarily, reduced overcrowding.","text - economic and financial environment":"Belgium has an open and competitive service- and export-oriented economy. Doing business in the country is relatively easy despite rigid labour and tax regulations. Belgium has a large financial industry but has taken steps to improve transparency. Although it is still considered a tax haven and it might continue to attract dirty money, Belgium has become significantly less secretive, probably making it a more difficult jurisdiction for money launderers. The country is believed to have a relatively resilient Anti-Money Laundering\/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML-CFT) framework. It has an adequate legal and institutional AML-CFT framework, but one remaining vulnerability is the trade in diamonds.","text - civil society and social protection":"Belgium has introduced a number of protection mechanisms and procedures for victims of human trafficking and certain forms of human smuggling, such as residence permit rights upon cooperation with investigators. The Belgian system has worked in some cases, but very few victims enter victim procedures.

The country has set up a number of preventative strategies to tackle organized crime at federal and local levels. Some of these address specific crime markets and bring together various public institutions to form a coherent and comprehensive approach. Other strategies are more locally oriented and tackle crimes specific to their area. Civil society plays an important role in Belgian social and political life, as well as in responding to some crime markets, such as human trafficking and wildlife crimes. Belgium enjoys a high level of media freedom and any attempts to silence critical journalism is considered anti-constitutional.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Brussels","GDP (current $US million)":"533097.46","Income group":"High income","Population":"11502704","Land Area (sq. km)":"30530","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"31","Freedom in the World Index":"96","Human Development Index":"0.93","Global Peace Index":"1.50","Democracy Index":"7.51","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"76","GDP per capita (current US$)":"46345","1":"4.34","1.1":"5.05","1.2":"3.63","2":"7.00"},{"Corresp":"22","ISO-3":"BIH","Country":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","ISO-2":"BA","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Central & Eastern Europe","Flag file":"ba.png","1.

Victims are trafficked mainly for sexual exploitation and forced labour. Bosnia and Herzegovina is as a transit country for victims of Chinese, Indian and Turkish descent, as well as victims from Middle Eastern and the Gulf countries attempting to enter Europe. Bosnians are often victims of forced labour in the construction industry and other sectors in neighbouring Balkan and European countries. Within the country, Bosnian women and girls are trafficked for sexual exploitation in private residences and motels. In particular, marginalized Roma and other children are forced to beg, are sexually exploited and forced to do domestic work. Child trafficking is reportedly a significant issue and is on the rise. The number of foreign victims of human trafficking inside Bosnia and Herzegovina is low, but there have been recorded cases in which victims were from Afghanistan, Cuba, The Gambia, Libya and Sri Lanka. ##&& Human smuggling is a significant issue in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country that plays an important role in the transit of individuals smuggled into the rest of Europe. Smuggled individuals tend to originate from the Middle East and North Africa region, most often entering Bosnia and Herzegovina from Serbia and Montenegro. Organized crime actors with connections to the political elite are known to assist smuggled individuals as they enter and leave the country, but local populations operating opportunistically also play an important role in the crime market. Thousands of smuggled individuals have found themselves stuck in the country because of the relatively strong border control in neighbouring countries, exacerbated by further restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking is a significant issue in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many arms from the 1990s remain in circulation and it is among the top countries globally in terms of the number of legal and illegal firearms in civilian possession. Additionally, Bosnia and Herzegovina is situated along one of the trafficking routes between large arms-supplying countries, such as Serbia and Montenegro, and destination countries for illegal firearms in Europe. This facilitates the trafficking of old weapons to organized crime groups in Austria and Germany and in Scandinavian countries. Furthermore, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a known transit country for converted weapons.","text - environment":"The main environmental crime markets in Bosnia and Herzegovina are those for illicit logging and illegal wildlife products. Criminal markets exist for non-renewable resources, albeit on a far smaller scale. Bosnia and Herzegovina is an exporter of both timber and timber products, mainly to the EU and neighbouring countries. Illicit exports are facilitated by gaps in legislative and customs regulatory frameworks, as well as by shortcomings in border control. Individuals connected to the political sphere and those who control public companies engage in the market. ##&& Fauna-based illicit markets are known to exist, the most prevalent of which is the trade in endangered species. The market for quails, in particular, has become popular due to hunting tourism. However, there is no clear evidence suggesting any organized involvement of transnational organized crime actors in the illegal fauna market. Trade in commodities, such as fuel oil and natural minerals, is known to occur at the border between Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro. Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is a small, but noteworthy, amount of illegal extraction of minerals and coal.","text - drugs":"Bosnia and Herzegovina is an important transit country for heroin and cannabis bound for Europe. Domestic consumption of cannabis and some cultivation and production of cannabis and synthetic drugs, such as MDMA, also known as ecstasy or molly, is known to occur. It is on the route for heroin trafficked for Central Europe, making Bosnia and Herzegovina an important transit and storage country for heroin and precursor chemicals such as acidic anhydride. Chemical components for MDMA, including rare crystal powder, are imported from EU countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, and are then produced in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Cannabis is transported from Albania to Bosnia and Herzegovina from where it is trafficked to Western European countries. Moreover, Bosnia and Herzegovina has recently become a source of sour cannabis, with reports of emerging indoor cultivation and growing production in the southern and western parts of the country. ##&& The crime market for cocaine in Bosnia and Herzegovina is less valuable and pervasive than the markets for other drugs. However, more groups are entering the market and stronger ties have been established between crime groups in Republika Srpska (with affiliations to crime organizations in Serbia and Montenegro) and Latin American drug traffickers.","text - criminal actors":"Both mafia-style groups, criminal networks, state-embedded actors and foreign criminal groups have a presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mafia-style groups are heavily involved in drugs, particularly heroin, and arms trafficking. A number of Bosnian mafia-style groups operate in various European countries and Bosnian criminals play important roles in the underworlds of these countries. Smaller criminal networks are heavily engaged in crime markets across Bosnia and Herzegovina, though the crimes are more low-level than those of the larger mafia-style actors. These networks are divided mainly along ethnic lines \u2212 between Serbs, Bosnians and Croats \u2212 though they frequently collaborate. Mafia-style actors or criminal networks from other countries in the Balkans have a sustained presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Organized crime actors originating in Kosovo, Croatia and Serbia, and to a lesser extent Montenegro and Albania, are known to hide and operate across Bosnia and Herzegovina. Additionally, Turkish and Middle Eastern criminal actors wield significant influence over crime markets in the country. Corruption levels are high, and many criminal actors enjoy protection from individuals in the state apparatus. Some members of crime groups are employed in state institutions; others are members of dominant political parties. Political groups and criminal networks often have overlapping interests.","text - leadership and governance":"Bosnia and Herzegovina has a unique political architecture, with a tripartite presidency that consists of one Bosnian, one Serb and one Croat who act as the head of state on a rotating basis. Under this system, unity has been difficult to maintain and there have been many instances in which the three presidents disagree on policy. As the political system of Bosnia and Herzegovina is highly decentralized, a significant amount of power lies with the cantons. Although leaders have vowed to fight crime, they have ultimately lacked the ability to take national leadership on the issue \u2212 for example, by outlining a coherent national security strategy. With several cantonal governments, it is difficult to root out political corruption and nepotism, which enables a high degree of state capture by organized crime actors. While the country has adopted satisfactory policies against corruption and organized crime on paper, independent safeguards against corruption are weak and grand corruption and state capture remain systemic issues. ##&& Bosnia and Herzegovina has ratified nearly all the relevant organized crime treaties. However, low levels of cooperation exist between Bosnia and Herzegovina and other countries, in large part because of the divergent foreign policy agendas of various government entities. At the same time, however, Bosnia and Herzegovina participates in both INTERPOL and Europol; its agreement on operational and strategic cooperation with Europol came into force in March 2017. The country is a signatory to the Convention on Police Cooperation in Southeast Europe, the Operational and Strategic Agreement with Europol and a number of bilateral agreements with its neighbours, including on joint patrols, cooperation mechanisms and local border traffic. Although domestic laws and policies against organized crime generally live up to global standards, implementation is severely lacking.","text - criminal justice and security":"Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s judiciary is weak and often suffers from political interference. As a result, it cannot consistently guarantee due process. While some progress has been made regarding judicial reform, the process has been riddled with delays and corruption remains a fundamental concern. Due to the administrative structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are 16 security agencies operating in the country on different administrative levels. The ability to effectively dismantle criminal organisations is seriously hampered by a lack of coordination between the many authorities in the country. Investigative capacities among law-enforcement entities are generally weak and, in some cases, police have been found to be highly corrupt and to engage in criminal activity. Additionally, Bosnia and Herzegovina lacks the infrastructure to control its borders, making it difficult to fight illicit flows moving across its borders.","text - economic and financial environment":"Administrative complexities and high levels of corruption make Bosnia and Herzegovina a relatively difficult place to do business and a somewhat unattractive investment destination. Bosnia and Herzegovina faces a risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. Although anti-money laundering legislation is in place, its enforcement remains inadequate. Institutions generally fail to apply anti-money laundering laws and there is significant room for improvement in financial investigations. Audit and tax administration reports continue to be used in a non-systematic and reactive, rather than a proactive, manner. Financial investigations are not launched systematically in corruption cases and the overall anti-money laundering framework needs further alignment with FATF standards \u2212 the internationally endorsed global standards against money laundering and terrorist financing, which increases transparency and enables countries to take successful action against the illicit use of their financial systems.","text - civil society and social protection":"Bosnia and Herzegovina lacks the administrative and institutional capacity to provide support for victims and witnesses of organized crime. While victim and witness support in courts has been improved in recent years, the lack of harmonisation between various legal frameworks across the country continues to engender differences in the scope of protection, as well as inequalities in access to justice for all types of proceedings. Crime prevention mechanisms remain inadequate, although dedicated corruption-prevention bodies have been set up across Bosnia and Herzegovina. Civil society organizations (CSOs) continue to play a role in the response to organized crime, particularly when it comes to victim support. While progress has been made in building institutional mechanisms for cooperation between governments and CSOs, there remains room to improve the inclusion of civil society in decision making. Bosnia and Herzegovina performs well in terms of press freedom compared with other countries in the Western Balkans, but the country\u2019s independent journalists often find themselves subject to intimidation and defamation suits.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Sarajevo","GDP (current $US million)":"20164.19","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"3301000","Land Area (sq. km)":"51210","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"72.9","Freedom in the World Index":"53","Human Development Index":"0.78","Global Peace Index":"2.04","Democracy Index":"4.84","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"35","GDP per capita (current US$)":"6109","1":"5.89","1.1":"5.15","1.2":"6.63","2":"3.92"},{"Corresp":"26","ISO-3":"BGR","Country":"Bulgaria","ISO-2":"BG","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Central & Eastern Europe","Flag file":"bg.png","1.

Several types of criminal structures operate within the market, each having a specific modus operandi, but no single criminal actor holds a monopoly. A local demand for victims of human trafficking also exists, primarily in Bulgaria's larger cities and resorts. The internet plays a large role in the disjointed nature of the market as it allows independent workers to enter the sex trade freely. While criminal structures now work with contracts and exert control over their victims by means of market mechanisms, those trafficked to Western and Northern Europe to work as beggars are still punished and experience a significant degree of cruelty if their daily quotas are not met. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many victims of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation have returned home to Bulgaria. ##&& In general, Bulgarian-based human smuggling networks provide in-transit logistics for the smuggling of migrants from Turkey to Serbia or Romania. However, some well-organized groups may also smuggle people all the way to their intended destinations. Most human smuggling groups have a foreign national as an organizer \u2013 someone who is based elsewhere and recruits migrants. Corruption is an important factor in human smuggling, with border officials facilitating the market and organizing boutique smuggling channels. Since the peak of the migrant crisis in 2015, flows have reduced and the market has shrunk significantly. However, it still has an impact on communities near Bulgaria's borders with Greece, Romania and Serbia, as well as in Sofia, which is a transit point for smugglers. Given that Bulgaria is an important part of the Balkan route, there may be a significant increase in the market if new irregular-migrant waves follow.","text - trade":"Although arms trafficking is not extensive, Bulgaria is an important transit country for Turkish-manufactured gas pistols trafficked to Western Europe, where they are converted to fire live ammunition. Information suggests that workers in arms-manufacturing facilities smuggle and sell weapons or parts to poachers on the local market. To a much more limited extent, Bulgaria is a source country for firearms trafficking, mostly into Greece. The grey market generates much of the profit from arms trafficking. It involves intermediaries who, using falsified end-user certificates, sell arms to terrorist organizations and militias. The arms production sector is prone to corruption due to the economic dependence of some cities on arms manufacturing. It is highly likely that low- and mid-level officials at border checkpoints, especially on the Turkish border, are paid to facilitate arms trafficking.","text - environment":"Widespread corruption in the forestry sector in Bulgaria enables a significant illicit logging market. Legitimate companies take part in illicit logging, using corruption or fraud to avoid regulation. There are instances of government officials being part of the organized networks who illegally extract timber, and allegations exist of links between major political parties and the so-called wood mafia. Private business interests also contribute to the illegal logging industry \u2013 entire forests have been unlawfully felled to make way for the construction of resorts and their infrastructure. Fauna crimes are much smaller in comparison. ##&& Poaching occurs in Bulgaria, but it is uncommon and small scale, linked to individuals rather than organized crime. The illegal caviar trade and sturgeon overexploitation are a concern. Only few countries, including Bulgaria, have viable populations of wild caviar, and Bulgarian sturgeon farms are known to launder wild-caught sturgeon and market the caviar through fraud and counterfeiting. The market for non-renewable resource crimes is significant. Oil trafficking is especially prominent in Bulgaria, with estimates of illegal oil sales accounting for a 20-40% share of the total market. Illegal diesel fuel sales are also a problem. Illicit coal mining is recorded, but it is small scale, perpetrated by groups of two to three people extracting fuel for heat.","text - drugs":"Bulgaria is an important transit country for the heroin market, with domestic networks being involved mostly in logistics. Sources point to more than 70% of the heroin in Western and Central Europe transiting the Balkan route, with most of the drug passing through Bulgaria, although quantities moved through the country are likely to have decreased somewhat following the COVID-19 lockdowns.* Most of the heroin is bound for Western Europe and comes from Turkey. Local demand accounts for a small part of the profits made. Heroin is the preferred drug of the marginalized, especially the Roma community, who are allegedly involved in trafficking small quantities of heroin from Turkey and distributing it in Bulgaria. Corruption is an important element of heroin trafficking, yet there are low levels of violence within the drug market in general. ##&&Although Serbia was a primary entry point for cocaine in the past, recent reports claim that flows have shifted to Romania and Bulgaria. The latter is primarily a transit country, but a small market exists in the larger cities and resorts. Bulgarian-based criminal networks have traditionally played a logistical role in cocaine trafficking, successfully facilitating large-scale operations from South America to Western Europe. However, they are now increasingly organizing their own operations and recruiting mules to traffic cocaine directly to their destination markets.##&&Bulgaria is mainly a transit country for the illegal cannabis market, which has grown massively since 2018. Criminal networks are involved in the logistics of cannabis trafficking from Albania to Turkey, Serbia and Romania. Recently, increasing quantities of cannabis grown in Bulgaria have been exported to Turkey and Greece. Cannabis is the most prevalent drug in the country and demand is widespread, which has prompted organized-crime groups to enter the market. Corruption most likely plays an important role in cannabis trafficking, with checkpoints on the Macedonian, Romanian and Turkish borders being the most vulnerable. The consumption of synthetic drugs is also on the rise in Bulgaria. Groups from the Sofia region have established themselves as amphetamine producers, while groups in the southeast of the country specialize in methamphetamine production. Police reports indicate a rise in courier deliveries of synthetic drugs purchased online. Precursors also transit through or are destined for Bulgaria, while synthetic drugs arriving from the Netherlands, Belgium and the Czech Republic are trafficked through Bulgaria to Turkey, the Middle East and North Africa. Foreign criminal actors, mostly of Turkish origin and based in Western Europe, reportedly organize these flows.","text - criminal actors":"High-level political figures are implicated in numerous illicit activities, from illegal logging to the smuggling of drugs and cigarettes. There are allegedly two groups that are deeply rooted within the highest echelons of government and cooperate with each other. The influence of state-embedded actors extends from Bulgaria\u2019s government to its justice system, allowing them near-full control over the state apparatus. For the most part, state actors facilitate criminal markets by providing protection. There are a number of public-procurement contracts awarded to specific companies that do not follow proper protocols, and officials at the highest political levels trade in influence. The traditional mafia\u2019s influence has declined as most groups have been dissolved. Those who remain have set up legitimate businesses and established their influence in the legal economy and politics, but they are still involved in criminal operations as well, primarily extortion and drug trafficking. ##&& A number of criminal networks, differing in structure and size, operate in almost all the traditional criminal markets and also engage in vehicle theft, loan sharking and phone fraud. They target Bulgaria's larger cities and resorts, but may also be based in its smaller municipalities and border regions. These criminal networks are now less violent towards trafficking victims, with the exception of forced begging. Drug markets are also relatively unaffected by violence, with force rarely being used. Criminal networks cooperate closely with both state-embedded and foreign criminal actors ( Albanians, Turks, Latin Americans and Italians, who operate in their own countries). Foreign criminal actors rarely operate within the country itself, with the notable exception of Afghani human-smuggling networks, which conduct their business in Bulgaria but are controlled from Afghanistan.","text - leadership and governance":"Bulgaria's political elite put countering organized crime high on the agenda and boast successes in the field. The primary concerns of the international community stem from issues of corruption and the rule of law. In general, there is the political will to tackle all major forms of organized crime, although the response is weak in countering white-collar crime and corruption, where political interests persist. Corruption is extensive and public trust in institutions is low. Notably, criminal influence threatens the democratic process, with the buying of election votes being a common practice. There is an anti-corruption body, but it is neither effective nor independent. Transparency has improved significantly, with institutions now publishing annual reports and statistics on their activities, but shortcomings still exist. Major issues are public accountability, control of the prosecution service and difficult access to public information. ##&& Bulgaria is party to most international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. The country generally adheres to all relevant mechanisms, but it has been criticized for its lack of compliance with the UN Convention against Corruption. Bulgaria is a member of and an active contributor to a number of regional and global counterterrorism and anti-organized crime initiatives, and there have been a number of successful international operations in the field. While laws adequately account for organized crime threats, there is no national anti-organized crime strategy. Instead, policies are typically designed in an ad-hoc manner, in the form of measures against different types of organized crime, and sentences for certain offences have been lax. Progress has been made in anti-corruption reforms, but proper enforcement is lacking.","text - criminal justice and security":"Bulgaria has a specialized court tasked with presiding mainly over organized crime related hearings as well as a specialized anti-organized crime unit within the judiciary, the Specialized Prosecutor\u2019s Office, but there are concerns about the latter's independence. Corruption within the judiciary continues to mar its work, and the criminal justice process remains outdated and slow, making prosecution difficult. The prison system has been criticized for overcrowding, ill-treatment of inmates, poor material conditions and inadequate health care \u2013 all issues which are reportedly being addressed. There are specialized law enforcement units tasked with countering organized crime, but it is difficult to assess their effectiveness. The main factors diminishing their success are linked to a lack of political will to tackle certain forms of organized crime. Corruption within law enforcement, including the customs and border police, is problematic, as is political influence. Bulgaria\u2019s borders are under constant pressure from illicit flows, made worse by the hard-to-police terrain and strategic position of the country on the Balkan route. In spite of these issues, Bulgaria's capacity to control and protect its borders has improved significantly in recent years and is now on par with best practices.","text - economic and financial environment":"While the Bulgarian government has put emphasis on the development of adequate anti-money-laundering (AML) legislation that complies with EU regulations, practical enforcement is weak (in spite of there being a financial crimes unit) and money-laundering investigations are rare. The country is nonetheless perceived as being highly resilient to money laundering, mainly because of the good performance of its AML framework. ##&& Bulgaria's economic regulatory environment has improved slowly over the years, largely due to the growing number of electronic services and the resultant electronic exchange of data between institutions. Nevertheless, the results are negligible when compared to the billions that have been spent on e-government. The state\u2019s capacity to ensure that legitimate businesses are able to operate without interference from criminal groups has improved, but there are still entities and state actors who are able to extort and appropriate businesses with the help of the judiciary and the National Revenue Agency. Corruption, a lack of political independence and ineffective administrative processes in other key regulatory bodies also contribute to a permissive environment where organized crime is able to proliferate. Criminal groups are not directly involved in economic market regulation; however, they have influence over the authorities responsible for this regulation.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government has a framework in place to provide shelter and support to victims of trafficking, while state and non-state institutions treat drug dependencies. There is legislation that regulates witness support and protection, but amendments made in 2018 have contributed to the opaqueness of the witness-protection bureau, which falls under the supervision of the prosecutor general \u2013 who allegedly uses the organization as a private army rather than for its intended purpose. Witnesses of corruption and organized crime are therefore fearful of collaborating with the authorities. ##&& There are prevention strategies that cover general and organized crime, but these are not as efficient as initially envisioned and a culture of crime prevention is still weak. While NGOs and citizens are officially considered an integral part of the state\u2019s efforts to tackle crime, the government is not very open to criticism. Civil society organizations do their best to improve the country, but the state is not fully committed to promoting their independence. ##&& Corruption and collusion between politicians and the media is widespread in Bulgaria, but there are also independent media outlets. These are often the target of smear campaigns, and their journalists have suffered physical attacks on themselves and their property.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Sofia","GDP (current $US million)":"68558.82","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"6975761","Land Area (sq. km)":"111000","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"51.6","Freedom in the World Index":"78","Human Development Index":"0.82","Global Peace Index":"1.63","Democracy Index":"6.71","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"44","GDP per capita (current US$)":"9828","1":"5.43","1.1":"5.10","1.2":"5.75","2":"5.29"},{"Corresp":"43","ISO-3":"HRV","Country":"Croatia","ISO-2":"HR","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Central & Eastern Europe","Flag file":"hr.png","1.

The internal market is rather scattered and mainly run by criminal network consisting of a few perpetrators, whereas the transit market is operated predominantly by foreign mafia-style groups. ##&& Foreign criminal actors dominate the human smuggling market in Croatia, but locals are also involved, albeit to a much lesser extent. There have been a few instances in recent years, where police officers have been implicated in the human smuggling trade. The continuation of the migrant crisis along the Balkan route has increased Croatia\u2019s vulnerability to human smuggling, with people predominantly from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, Algeria and Morocco being smuggled into the country. Despite the fact that many irregular migrants enter countries that are part of the Balkan route without assistance from smugglers, many continue their journey across Croatia and onwards to their destination with the assistance of smuggling rings. Thus, the country is a transit hub, especially the region of Karlovac, rather than a destination.","text - trade":"The Croatian arms trafficking market is transnational in nature, albeit limited. There is some demand for firearms in Croatia, but it has been largely met by weapons left over from the Homeland War. Reportedly, criminal networks and gangs acquire weapons from across the Balkans and mostly use Croatia as a corridor to Western Europe, where supplies are limited and prices for firearms are higher.","text - environment":"There is no evidence to suggest the existence of a significant criminal market for illicit flora in Croatia, but teak from Myanmar, bound for luxury boat builders in the Netherlands, has been trafficked through Croatia. This suggests that legitimate Croatian companies may be engaging in transnational timber trafficking, facilitated by low levels of law enforcement at Croatian ports. It is likely that significant profits from timber trafficking have been laundered into Croatia\u2019s legal economy. A more worrisome occurrence relates to allegations made against the country's public enterprise for forest management, purportedly involved in mismanagement of forest resources, fraudulent public procurement and corruption. There is also evidence of an active wood mafia operating within Croatia and illegally trafficking timber to neighbouring countries. Other flora-related crimes that may occur on a very small scale in the country are linked to construction in tourist areas as well as new villas and gardens, in which exotic plants may be grown. While poaching is an issue and endangered wildlife species have been smuggled into Croatia, there is nothing to indicate the presence of a significant criminal market for illicit fauna in the country. Most notably, bird species such as quail and common whitethroat, among others, are targeted by poachers and sold to restaurants, as are some endangered shell and clam species. Historically, songbirds have been poached and sold into Italy, although no current information on the issue is available, which suggests that there may have been a decrease in this illicit activity. ##&& ##&& Similarly to flora and fauna, the criminal market for non-renewable resources in Croatia is not significant. Illicit oil and gas drilling may occur on a very small scale in the Adriatic Sea, and some instances of corruption related to the legal oil trade have been recorded.

Illegal imports of hydrofluorocarbons have been brought into the EU from members states such as Croatia and Greece.","text - drugs":"Available information suggests that several small criminal groups with flexible organizational structures dominate the Croatian drug market.

Traditionally, cocaine shipments, usually from South and Central America, were trafficked into Croatia by sea or land from Western Europe or Turkey. However, more recently, organized crime groups in the Western Balkans, including those with members of Croatian origin, have established more direct cocaine trafficking routes from South America to the European market, in collaboration with South American cartels. The domestic cocaine market is concentrated in major cities such as Zagreb, Split and Dubrovnik. ##&& Cannabis use is widespread in Croatia, with herbal cannabis being the most frequently seized substance in the country. Although the number of dismantled cannabis plantations in the country has remained stable over the past years, there has been an increase in the number of dismantled indoor cultivation sites. Despite the domestic cultivation of cannabis, most of it originates in Albania and is smuggled into Croatia via Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Groups smuggling cannabis into Croatia use both land and maritime routes. Domestic demand for synthetic drugs is arguably on the rise, with MDMA being the most consumed synthetic drug in Croatia. Amphetamines and MDMA are smuggled primarily from producing countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands, while methamphetamine is smuggled from Eastern Europe and Asia. Nevertheless, production takes place in Croatia as well, with a number of small laboratories having been identified and disrupted. Reports also indicate new psychoactive substances being mainly bought online.","text - criminal actors":"There no evidence to suggest that the state itself exerts control over or even engages in specific criminal markets. There is, however, ample evidence that Croatia suffers from criminal state capture and abuse of position for personal gain on a pandemic scale. This relates to the exploitation of public funds, the fixing or avoiding of public procurement and is basically present in all areas of public and private life in Croatia. Criminal networks are prominent in Croatia. They engage in most illegal markets, but around 70% of all known criminal networks mainly focus on drug trafficking, smuggling of persons, as well as tax and customs evasion. These groups vary in size, but are for the most part relatively small, consisting of 5 to 10 members. They are dispersed across the country, but criminal activity is focused in Croatia's major cities of Zagreb, Split and Rijeka. Perpetrated violence is low and corruption is used to avoid detection and prosecution. ##&& Anecdotal evidence suggests there are major mafia-style groups in Croatia, but arguably only one \u2013 Prido\u0161lice i za\u0161titari \u2013 fits the criteria. Reportedly, the group has a leader and two lieutenants below him, with lower-ranking members known to the authorities. The group is predominantly active in extortion, has access to weapons and uses violence. Usually, gang members carry knives and small arms. However, they rarely commit murder unless they want to demonstrate power, intimidate foes or eliminate potential threats. Croatian intelligence agencies assess domestic organized crime groups to be well networked with regional groups with whom they frequently trade services and provide logistics to each other when operating outside their domestic territories. Nevertheless, there is minimal evidence to suggest the strong influence in Croatia of foreign actors, who, for the most part, use the country as an access point for maritime and other trafficking routes in Europe. There are, however, legitimate Croatia-registered companies, which are protected by the state and control the energy market. These companies are financed by foreign entities and are reportedly able to promote foreign geostrategic interests in Croatia.","text - leadership and governance":"Given the country's socio-economic and geographic vulnerability, combatting organized crime is a political focus in Croatia. International initiatives in this field are of high priority within the framework of multilateral foreign-policy activities. Corruption and state capture are an issue and Croatia has made efforts to improve its anti-corruption framework. However, the anti-corruption rhetoric is not adequately translated into policy and implementation, whereby the main problem is political will rather than a suboptimal legal framework. ##&& Croatia has consolidated the fight against corruption under one organization, the Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime (USKOK), which has a wide political authority to investigate, prosecute and prevent corruption. USKOK shares the responsibility for investigating corruption in Croatia with the National Police Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime (PNUSKOK), with additional structures aiding anti-corruption efforts. There is also a parliamentary body tasked with coordinating the implementation of the anti-corruption strategy. The framework guiding freedom to information is assessed as very good and there are efforts to increase transparency. There are oversight mechanisms in place for the state corruption, but these measures have not been very effective. Despite the efforts made, faith in government is generally low and it is seen as corrupt on the national and local level alike. ##&& Croatia is party to all relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. The country is also an active participant in a number of global and regional initiatives, including the Southeast European Law Enforcement Centre and Europol. Thus, cooperation in law enforcement and information exchange between domestic law enforcement and intelligence agencies and their foreign counterparts is well established. Croatia\u2019s legislative framework covers all the relevant criminal markets, and, in line with its international commitments to countering organized crime, the country\u2019s national legislation is aligned with international standards. In spite of these measures, the implementation of legal mechanisms appears somewhat problematic.","text - criminal justice and security":"USKOK operates as a unit within Croatia\u2019s judicial system and is tasked with prosecuting cases of corruption and organized crime. There are also four specialized criminal judges \u2013 based in Zagreb, Rijeka, Split and Osijek \u2013 who are responsible for adjudicating cases of organized crime and corruption. Nevertheless, a lack of funds and poor capacity to close high-profile cases are recognized as major obstacles to the functioning of USKOK. More generally, political and economic pressures on the judiciary persist and, in turn, lower public trust in the system. While reports indicate that the functioning of the judicial system is problematic, some improvement has been made. ##&& ##&& Croatia's anti-corruption police unit (PNUSKOK), in its role as a specialized law-enforcement unit mandated to tackle organized crime, is also functional. Additionally, the security and intelligence agency of Croatia is tasked with the collection and analysis of information that will ultimately provide actionable intelligence to detect, prevent and disrupt organized crime. To this end, the customs administration also plays a significant part. All units report good cooperation with their international counterparts, as is evident in a number of joint investigations and anti-organized crime operations. ##&& ##&& However, the country\u2019s borders, especially the long and porous one with Bosnia and Herzegovina, are vulnerable to trafficking flows as Croatia is an extension of the Balkan route. In addition, the port of Ploce appears among the most vulnerable border points in Croatia. Furthermore, the country\u2019s border control has been under strain since Europe\u2019s migrant crisis began. While flows have reduced since the 2015 peak, irregular migrants using smugglers still try to enter the EU via unofficial border crossings between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Notably, there are reports of brutal treatment of migrants by Croatian border police.","text - economic and financial environment":"An anti-money laundering office was established within the Croatian Ministry of Finance to conduct financial investigations related to organized crime. The office analyses suspicious transactions and cooperates with other competent authorities in Croatia, as well as with its international counterparts. Overall, Croatia seems to have a robust AML\/CFT framework in place and is highly resilient to money laundering. Conversely, despite implementing certain reforms, the economic regulatory environment is burdensome and inefficient, yet is still conducive to doing business. A new labour law was put into effect in an effort to make the labour market more flexible and dynamic, but recent estimates put the grey economy at around a quarter of the country\u2019s GDP, and financial and economic crimes remain an issue for Croatia.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government has a fairly robust framework in place to provide support to victims of modern slavery. There is a national committee for monitoring and improving the victim and witness support system in the country, and Croatia\u2019s Ministry of Justice is a member of Victim Support Europe. Nevertheless, NGOs often cite a lack of help from the government in their victim- and witness-support efforts. There is a project on victim support, protection and compensation being implemented, which, among other things, aims to establish a central information point that makes possible the extraction of statistical data on victim-support procedures on individual cases. Croatia lacks a coherent crime prevention strategy and there is little information about priority areas and concrete activities. There are several strategic documents in place to guide prevention efforts of trafficking of human beings, corruption, cyber crime, domestic violence, etc., but it appears their purpose is self-sufficiency, not actual implementation. This does not mean that prevention is not ongoing, but rather points to a discrepancy between official strategies and actions plans that serve administrative purposes on the one hand, and actual prevention activities that are operationally implemented. This is likely a consequence of lacking analytical and research capacities within law enforcement. ##&& The media environment is somewhat stable, although there are certain issues. The public broadcaster is under political pressure, with certain groups attempting to influence its internal policies and operations. It appears that journalists who investigate corruption or organized crime are harassed, often through physical and cyber violence as well as threats. Nevertheless, investigative journalism plays a crucial role in uncovering corruption and reporting on state capture. Some investigative reports have had a significant impact, eventually leading to investigations and prosecutions. It, however, appears that most cases brought to a court fall short of an adequate judicial epilogue as a result of the slow and selective criminal justice system.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Zagreb","GDP (current $US million)":"60752.59","Income group":"High income","Population":"4065253","Land Area (sq. km)":"88070","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"49.8","Freedom in the World Index":"85","Human Development Index":"0.85","Global Peace Index":"1.62","Democracy Index":"6.50","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"47","GDP per capita (current US$)":"14944","1":"5.07","1.1":"4.75","1.2":"5.38","2":"5.58"},{"Corresp":"45","ISO-3":"CYP","Country":"Cyprus","ISO-2":"CY","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Southern Europe","Flag file":"cy.png","1.

This can be attributed largely to the country's geographical location as it sits at a crossroads between Africa, Asia and Europe, at a global hotspot for irregular migration and trafficking. Cyprus is mainly a destination country for human trafficking, with sexual and labour exploitation being the two main purposes. The majority of sexually motivated exploitation is seasonal, taking place during the high tourist season between April and October. Migrant workers are often exploited and subjected to labour trafficking in the agriculture and construction industries. Victims subjected to labour trafficking are typically recruited by employment agencies on short-term work permits, but once the latter expire, victims are threatened, their pay and documents withheld and they experience debt-based coercion. Victims of human trafficking tend to come from a wide variety of Eastern European, South-east Asian, West African, East African and Central Asian & Caucasian countries. The response to human trafficking in Cyprus varies considerably between the two Cypriot entities, with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) essentially providing traffickers with impunity. ##&& For a number of years, Cyprus has been among the top recipients of asylum seekers in the European Union. It is primarily a transit country for irregular migrants, but reports indicate that it is becoming a destination country as well. The 2015 migrant and refugee crisis, combined with the country's close proximity to Turkey, has led to considerable growth in its human-smuggling market. The tolerance and practices of the Turkish authorities have enabled human smugglers to use Cyprus as a beachhead into Europe. The demilitarized and difficult-to-monitor UN buffer zone stretches for 180 kilometres, providing additional opportunities for smugglers. Reports indicate that many migrants are tricked into purchasing smuggling packages they believe are for Italy, Spain or Greece, only to end up in the TRNC, where they are forced to work long hours so they can buy false documents to get into the Republic of Cyprus. In many cases, such trickery constitutes a form of human trafficking.","text - trade":"Gun ownership in Cyprus is relatively high, but the criminal market for small arms and light weapons appears to be minor. Evidence suggests that local criminal actors normally acquire firearms by robbing army camps or army reservists\u2019 houses, but these sorts of incidents happen on rare occasions only.","text - environment":"Although there are many unanswered questions about the nature of environmental crimes in Cyprus, evidence suggests that the two predominant forms are illicit logging and the poaching of migratory birds. Illicit logging occurs within protected areas of the country and it is believed that most of this wood feeds a local demand for firewood, used primarily for heating. Within the criminal markets for fauna, the most common illicit activity is the poaching of migratory songbirds such as robins, blackcaps and thrushes. The demand comes primarily from local restaurants, where songbirds are served as part of the expensive delicacy of Ambelopoulia \u2013 a plate of cooked songbirds. Due to concerted attempts to curb poaching, there has been a significant reduction in the size of the criminal market over the years. ##&& There is little proof of the existence of a criminal market for non-renewable resources. However, the TRNC has been linked to the smuggling of oil products (most likely extracted by the Islamic State) from Syria to Turkey, as well as to the smuggling of refined-oil products from Libya to European markets.","text - drugs":"Cyprus is a destination market for cannabis, cocaine and synthetic drugs, but there is little indication that it is a trans-shipment point for drug-trafficking flows. Cannabis is the most the prevalent illicit drug in Cyprus, entering the country mostly via other European countries. While Cyprus is primarily a destination country, there are reports of small-scale local cultivation to supplement imported cannabis. There is little evidence to confirm or deny the involvement of specific organized-crime groups in the cannabis market. Cocaine is the second most consumed drug in Cyprus and one of its most valuable criminal markets. It enters the country primarily via passenger flights or airfreight, after first entering Europe via Belgium and the Netherlands. Mafia-style groups are known to control the criminal market for cocaine. ##&& There is not a big market for synthetic drugs in Cyprus. An increase in the use of amphetamines, methamphetamines and MDMA has been observed in recent years, but this growth has come off a very low base. During the tourist seasons, the demand for synthetic drugs is believed to increase substantially. These drugs are smuggled into the country mostly via air, with the majority originating in the Netherlands. There is a lack of information regarding specific organized-crime groups operating within the synthetic-drug market, but reports suggest that there are a large number of independent, low-level dealers. The heroin market in Cyprus is the smallest of the drug markets. Domestic demand is low, with only a handful of seizures in recent years.","text - criminal actors":"Russian groups appear prominent in the country; they are believed to be the best connected and to exert the most financial and economic power in Cyprus. British, Eastern European and Asian organized-crime groups also have a presence in Cyprus, while Turkish groups have established a significant foothold in the TRNC. In the human-trafficking and smuggling markets, in particular, there is a high level of collaboration between individuals in Cyprus and foreign criminal actors in countries such as Moldova, Russia, Uzbekistan and Romania, but foreign actors in the country are also involved in property crimes as well as poaching, among others. The state does not seem to exert significant control over any criminal market. However, organized criminals have been able to bribe border officers and other low-level government officials. More-prominent officials have allegedly been involved in money laundering. ##&& Criminal networks are highly influential, having a stake in drug trafficking in the country, as well as in illegal gambling and trafficking of women. Approximately 15 mafia-style groups allegedly operate across Cyprus, in Nicosia, Famagusta, Paphos and Limassol. Famagusta port more specifically is a hub for arms and goods smuggling. Though the majority cannot be explicitly named, they have a relatively clear leadership structure.","text - leadership and governance":"In recent years, the government of the Republic of Cyprus has renewed its commitment to combating organized crime, illustrated by its strengthened intelligence capacities and the establishment of a new law-enforcement agency to fight organized crime and terrorism. Corruption in Cyprus remains a substantial problem, with the country suffering from one of the highest levels of corruption in the EU. The institutional framework for fighting corruption is mostly adequate. However, it contains a number of significant gaps and suffers from low levels of trust, which critics say are due to the prevalence of politically motivated appointments and decisions. ##&& Cyprus has ratified all relevant international organized-crime conventions, including the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), the UNTOC protocols and the UN Convention against Corruption. Cyprus has several bilateral treaties with regional countries focused on cooperation in the countering of organized crime, terrorism, and the illicit use and trafficking of drugs. It has also signed and ratified bilateral agreements on judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, and is considered very active in global-policing efforts. Cyprus engages in cooperation on extradition, but has, on a number of occasions, failed to extradite criminals, which has had serious consequences. Cyprus\u2019s legal framework covers various aspects of organized crime, including legislation on illicit drugs, illegal fishing, human trafficking, cybercrime and money laundering.","text - criminal justice and security":"Cyprus\u2019s judiciary is independent and generally upholds due process in criminal matters. Nevertheless, a moderate risk of corruption exists in the judicial system, related in particular to the payment of bribes and irregular payments for the purpose of receiving favourable judgments. The judiciary suffers from a lack of staff and resources, which has led to poor enforcement, as well as significant delays and backlogs. Reports suggest prison overcrowding and conditions in detention facilities are a concern. There have also been allegations of criminal organizations wielding influence in prisons. With persistent allegations of police ill-treatment and lack of capacity of police to counter organized crime, law enforcement is a sector that needs improvement. Certain strides have been made, however, evident in the formation of an agency responsible for fighting organized crime and terrorism. ##&& Cyprus\u2019s territorial integrity is violated regularly by transnational smugglers and traffickers. The dispute over the northern half of Cyprus and hostile, often aggressive Turkish foreign policy is a source of fragility. As an island state, the Cyprus port and marine police play an important role in policing the country\u2019s territorial waters, but they regularly face accusations of abuse and disproportionate actions, particularly against boats carrying asylum seekers and other migrants.","text - economic and financial environment":"Cyprus has an open economy that is heavily reliant on trade in services, particularly in the financial and tourism sectors. Overall, Cyprus's economic regulatory environment is conducive to doing business. However, there are still concerns over the country's relatively high unemployment rate and the fact that it is heavily reliant on external investment. Procurement processes are vulnerable to corrupt practices, and organized crime is reportedly deeply entrenched within legitimate businesses. This is especially true in the nightlife sector, where large investments have been made, making it possible for considerable quantities of laundered money to flow out of these legal entities. ##&& With its large, highly secretive offshore financial industry, Cyprus is a well-known hub for money laundering. Following the economic collapse that occurred in 2013, a stricter framework against money laundering was adopted, but a number of risks and vulnerabilities remain. These are for the most part related to international business \u2013 notably real-estate deals and banking. Recent years have seen some major money-laundering scandals on the island, including one that implicated a company co-owned by President Nicos Anastasiades; a claim that was later dismissed by the state's anti-money laundering unit. Nevertheless, Cyprus has worked hard to align its banking regulations with EU directives, as well as to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s common standard on reporting. While major issues remain, this has strengthened Cyprus\u2019 Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism framework.","text - civil society and social protection":"Cyprus has established a fairly robust system for assisting the victims and witnesses of organized crime, who are entitled to protection under the official witness-protection programme. The government has installed various mechanisms to protect the victims of human trafficking, including a system for identifying and helping them to access relevant social, health and psychosocial services. However, these measures are sometimes criticized by civil society for being slow and for lacking transparency in the identification process. With regard to support for drug users, a number of harm-reduction programmes have been put in place, including opioid-substitution treatment, which is also available in prisons. ##&& The Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and authorities generally respects these freedoms. While journalists can engage in critical reporting, some of those who have covered controversial topics such as corruption and organized crime have faced threats and censorship.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Nicosia","GDP (current $US million)":"24948.94","Income group":"High income","Population":"1198575","Land Area (sq. km)":"9250","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"57.4","Freedom in the World Index":"94","Human Development Index":"0.89","Global Peace Index":"1.92","Democracy Index":"7.56","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"57","GDP per capita (current US$)":"27858","1":"4.19","1.1":"3.50","1.2":"4.88","2":"4.42"},{"Corresp":"46","ISO-3":"CZE","Country":"Czech Republic","ISO-2":"CZ","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Central & Eastern Europe","Flag file":"cz.png","1.

Marginalized communities, homeless people with disabilities and migrants on short-term visas are the most vulnerable to human trafficking. Women are forced into prostitution and into \u2018advantageous\u2019 marriages to non-Europeans. The Czech Republic is a hub for pornographic production and many victims of human trafficking are exploited in the industry. Women are often forced to work in massage parlours, nail salons, casinos, etc. Men are usually forced into demanding physical labour. Domestic crime networks and foreign criminal actors operate in the human-trafficking market. It is common for offenders to recruit victims through employment agencies or deceptive private, unregistered labour agencies, which are run by locals, often with a foreign connection. ##&& As part of the Central European migration corridor, the Czech Republic has been identified as a significant transfer zone for migrants being smuggled to Western European countries. Human smuggling in the Czech Republic is facilitated by crime networks and foreign actors. In the early nineties, Vietnamese criminal groups were suspected of smuggling people between the Czech Republic and Germany. The largest groups at the time were the Vuong Van Vu\u2019s gang and the Khac Dan\u2019s group. Although there is no indication of whether these continue to function, evidence suggests that people, including children, are trafficked from Vietnam to the UK through the Czech Republic. Allegedly, lost or stolen documents are forged in the country and sold to foreign nationals.","text - trade":"The Czech Republic is largely a country of origin and a transit point for arms trafficking. Illicit firearms are reactivated and converted. Most of the non-lethal weapons are sourced from the Czech Republic or other countries with lax gun laws and are then sold elsewhere in Europe, where they are converted to fire live ammunition. Organized-criminal groups as well as individual citizens are involved in arms trafficking, the latter often unknowingly. Information suggests that old Czech military equipment is resold to conflict zones in Africa and the Middle East. Although legal, some exports have ended up in violation of arms embargoes \u2013 such as the sale of arms to foreign companies that redistribute weapons to conflict zones. Czech companies are allegedly used as proxies to bypass sanctions, including continued deliveries to Azerbaijan and Syria. The illicit arms market in the country is facilitated by an increasingly diverse range of foreign criminal actors, though Czechs continue to comprise a plurality of those actors. Criminal offenders from the Vietnamese diaspora in the country are another prominent actor on the market.","text - environment":"While there are some instances of illegal logging in the Czech Republic, it does not appear to be significant. By extension, neither is the illegal flora market. However, observers have noted that the country has been used as a point of entry and transit point for Myanmar teak imported via Slovenia, which was subsequently funnelled to the Netherlands. Conversely, the country arguably has one of the largest illegal fauna markets in Europe. It hosts a significant market for bear parts and is a central point for post-mortem poaching, where CITES-protected species are imported from Poland and Slovakia, for instance, processed for traditional Chinese medicine and trafficked to Asia. It is highly likely that these practices are facilitated by criminal actors from the Vietnamese diaspora in the country. Vietnamese groups are involved in trafficking animal products from Africa to Vietnam. Live animals have been smuggled into the Czech Republic as well. ##&& In addition, the country is known for oil smuggling and oil-related fraud. Crime groups avoid VAT and excise duties by exporting oil and then smuggling it back into the Czech Republic. Mis-invoicing and the dilution of fuel with other substances \u2014 producing sub-standard fuel \u2014 is common. Similarly, fraud and mis-invoicing occur in the coal business. Employees of coal-extraction companies illegally sell to companies at extremely discounted rates without company approval. Allegedly, networks involved in the non-renewable resources crime market are connected to state-embedded actors and in some instances foreign criminal actors with political influence.","text - drugs":"Heroin appears to be among the least-popular substances in the Czech Republic, which positions the country more as a transit point in the trade of the drug. For the most part, foreign criminal actors are involved in smuggling heroin into the Czech Republic \u2014 predominately from Albania and Kosovo. In recent years, however, heroin flows have shifted from the Balkan route to the South Caucasus route, with heroin from Iran passing through Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia to Ukraine, Moldova and then through central Europe, including the Czech Republic. Indications point to criminal proceeds generated from the heroin trade being laundered in the country through chains of casinos. Although cocaine is not the most-prevalent substance in the Czech Republic, the market is on the rise. Reportedly, the \u2019Ndrangheta as well Nigerian and Balkan organized-crime groups are involved in trafficking cocaine into the country, importing the drug primarily from Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands. ##&& Cannabis is the most prevalent drug in the Czech Republic. To satisfy the demand, cannabis is produced locally or smuggled from Slovakia and Hungary. Czech nationals and Vietnamese criminal groups are involved in the distribution and have allegedly established ties to \u2018grow shops\u2019. Reports indicate that certain quantities of cannabis are trafficked from the Czech Republic to other European countries, such as Germany. The Czech Republic is thought to be the largest producer of methamphetamine in Europe. The majority of labs are found in western Bohemia, close to the German borders \u2013 a strategic location for export to Western Europe. Although production sites are small and controlled by independent actors, a recent shift has been observed of larger groups producing on a larger scale. Again, Czech nationals and Vietnamese criminal groups have been linked to the production and distribution of methamphetamine, but groups from the Western Balkans and Bulgaria are active in the market in the country as well. MDMA, also known as ecstasy and Molly, is imported into the country from abroad, primarily from the Netherlands, as are other synthetic drugs, including precursors, which are produced in China and trafficked into the Czech Republic.","text - criminal actors":"Apart from some reports of corruption, there is no evidence that the Czech state is purposefully allowing or facilitating any criminal markets. However, accounts exist of money laundering, corruption and the misdirection of funds. Recently, security forces have turned their attention from foreign criminal actors operating in the Czech Republic to political corruption and financial crime, which might indicate an increased influence of state-embedded actors. Nevertheless, foreign criminal actors remain heavily involved in organized crime in the Czech Republic. Along with Vietnamese criminal groups, which dominate fauna and arms trafficking, as well as cannabis and methamphetamine production and distribution, reports indicate that criminal groups from Russia, Kosovo, Albania, Italy and Armenia operate in the country. Foreign nationals are also involved in human smuggling and trafficking, with the nationality of the victims of human trafficking often coinciding with that of the perpetrators. ##&& \u2019Loose\u2019 networks function in the country and are reportedly involved in different sectors of organized crime. These networks are mainly prevalent in the cannabis- and synthetic-drug markets, as well as the fauna markets (involving domestically raised fauna), arms trade, non-renewable resource crimes and possibly human smuggling. Conversely, there is no official or credible evidence that domestic mafia-style groups operate in the country.","text - leadership and governance":"The government has taken a public anti-corruption and anti-immigrant stance. Corruption perception levels in the Czech Republic are comparably low and there have been instances of money laundering and corruption by government officials. There is an anti-corruption unit within the police force, as well as an advisory group \u2013 the Anti-Corruption Committee \u2014 which works on drafting and passing corruption-related legislative reforms. Access to information in the country is another issue, with the country\u2019s right to information framework being rather poor and creating an ambiguous and difficult-to-navigate system. ##&& The Czech Republic is party to most international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, including the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its three protocols. It is party to the European Convention on Extradition and has a bilateral agreement on extradition with the US. In line with the country\u2019s international commitments to anti-organized crime, the Czech Republic\u2019s legislative framework adequately accounts for organized-crime threats. Notably however, punishment for drug-related offences is considered comparably lax. Although drug trafficking is illegal in the Czech Republic, drug use is not deemed a criminal offence regardless of the drug type. In addition, the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes has been legalized as has been the cultivation of cannabis for medicinal supply.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judiciary is strong and independent, although political influence in high-profile cases has been problematic in the past. Allegedly, there is a moderate risk of corruption in the judicial system; bribes for favourable rulings have been recorded. In light of that, GRECO (the Group of States against Corruption) has called for the Czech Republic to expedite ongoing reforms to combat corruption among prosecutors and judges more effectively. Czech prisons are reportedly overcrowded and instances of drug trade in penitentiary institutions have been registered. There is a specific anti-organized-crime unit in the Czech Republic \u2014 the National Centre against Organized Crime \u2014 an anti-drug unit and a unit for police intelligence gathering. Risk of corruption within the police force is moderate. As the the Czech Republic\u2019s geography makes it vulnerable to trafficking flows, the country has been used to facilitate human smuggling. As a result, border-protection efforts have been stepped up in light of the 2015 migrant crisis.","text - economic and financial environment":"Reportedly, the country has made great progress in anti-money laundering through legislative reforms and increased efforts in pursuing investigations, but a need remains for law-enforcement agencies to adopt a more proactive stance on the matter. Nevertheless, the country\u2019s anti-money-laundering framework is sound and the country is assessed as highly resilient to money laundering and terrorist financing. Despite this, some evidence suggests that organized crime has penetrated the legal economy, using businesses as fronts for illegal operations.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim- and witness-support measures are in place, provided by state institutions and NGOs that are sponsored by the government and provide programmes to assist migrants, victims of trafficking and drug users. Witness protection is covered, with the government providing relocation, new identities, physical security, etc. There is legislation that sets out the rights of victims of crime. However, the national crime-prevention strategy is not organized-crime specific. While NGOs are funded by the government, the anti-migrant sentiment in the country has conditioned some budget cuts that could affect organizations working with migrant groups. Concerns for media freedom have been expressed. The media environment has significantly deteriorated since 2014 as political influences, as well as threats against journalists, persist. Media ownership is another recognizable issue as oligarchs have been acquiring outlets to push their agenda.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Prague","GDP (current $US million)":"250680.50","Income group":"High income","Population":"10671870","Land Area (sq. km)":"78870","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"39.3","Freedom in the World Index":"91","Human Development Index":"0.9","Global Peace Index":"1.34","Democracy Index":"7.67","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"54","GDP per capita (current US$)":"23490","1":"4.63","1.1":"4.75","1.2":"4.50","2":"6.25"},{"Corresp":"47","ISO-3":"DNK","Country":"Denmark","ISO-2":"DK","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Northern Europe","Flag file":"dk.png","1.

Human trafficking in Demark is primarily carried out for labour exploitation and sex trafficking. Most human-trafficking victims are of foreign origin, including from Nigeria, Romania, Thailand, Uganda, Brazil, Ghana and Vietnam. However, in recent years, the Philippines has been the largest source country for victims of forced labour. Crime networks that facilitate human trafficking are typically from the victim\u2019s country of origin. Groups involved in this market can largely be classified as foreign actors, networks and mafia-style groups. In particular, forced labour involves organized- and semi-organized-crime groups. Victims work in restaurants, in construction, cleaning\/laundry businesses, among other industries. The perpetrators might function as subcontractors, sometimes to an unwitting client. Since selling and buying sex is legal in Denmark, operating brothels exist and provide a means through which crime groups can make their enterprise quasi-legal. Most people are tricked by a person familiar to them and subsequently trafficked. Sometimes, individuals who have been smuggled into the country are subject to trafficking after they become indebted for travel, lodging and\/or food. ##&& Denmark is mainly a transit \u2212 but also a destination \u2212 country for human smuggling. The primary driver of human smuggling is debt. However, deception is often involved, and it is difficult to know which workers have been voluntarily smuggled. Voluntarily smuggled individuals often come from the Ukraine, the Philippines, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Bangladesh. The crime groups dominating this market include international networks with ties to criminal mafia-style groups. Danish citizens have assisted irregular refugees to reach Sweden on humanitarian grounds. The domestic market for human smuggling in Denmark is significantly smaller compared with its neighbours.","text - trade":"Firearms are commonly smuggled into Denmark, either to be sold or simply pass through, rather than being used. Illegal and legal arms are taken abroad and then trafficked into Denmark. The most common way of smuggling weapons is in large trucks or heavy-goods vehicles from the Western Balkans. The trafficking of arms between Denmark and Sweden is thought to be extensive and largely run by gangs. Criminal gangs in Denmark are typically involved in several markets and those who smuggle drugs are often the same ones who sell firearms.","text - environment":"Flora-related crimes are limited in Denmark. However, several Danish timber companies have been found to be involved in illegal imports. Similarly, Denmark has a limited small-scale fauna market. As a high-income country, Denmark is more a destination market, with most illegally imported animals coming through Copenhagen Airport, where they are confiscated by customs. Individual perpetrators, such as enthusiasts or small-scale specialised smugglers, are the main criminal actors involved. Similarly, non-renewable resource crime is not a major problem in Denmark. Notably however, in the past decade, there has been an increase in the theft of copper. The most frequent means of stealing copper is by cutting cables between train tracks and selling them on the grey market for cash. Copper theft appears to be conducted in an organized manner by crime networks specialized in stealing precious metals and originating from Eastern Europe. It is worth noting that Danish companies are said to be involved in non-renewable resource crimes in Africa. There are indications that valuable minerals are used to launder money.","text - drugs":"Denmark is a destination and transit country for cannabis headed to Norway. Cannabis is produced in limited amounts in the country, mostly in the Christiania community, which runs its own drugs policies parallel to the Danish state. Cannabis cultivation is the most commonly reported drug production activity in Denmark. However, demand surpasses the amount of cannabis that can be supplied domestically. Therefore, a large amount of the cannabis in Denmark originates from North Africa, which is smuggled in via Southern Europe or maritime routes. Synthetic drugs like amphetamines and MDMA \u2014 also known as ecstasy and molly \u2014 rank second among the most frequently used drugs in Denmark. Small facilities have been found to produce amphetamines mainly for personal use, but amphetamines in the Danish market are primarily produced in the Netherlands and Central\/Eastern Europe. The drugs are typically smuggled into Denmark across the land border. Many transactions occur via the dark web. People affiliated with biker gangs in Denmark dominate the trade and distribution of amphetamines. ##&& Denmark is a destination market for heroin, mostly coming via the Balkan route. Danish mafia-style groups, in cooperation with Albanian mafia-style groups, control a sizeable share of the market. Smaller organized-crime groups and individuals \u2212 many of whom have family ties in source countries in Southern Asia or to transit countries along the Balkan route \u2212 conduct heroin trafficking. Denmark is a destination country for cocaine, where consumption has been increasing since 2013, particularly among young people who use it as a 'party drug'. Cocaine smuggled into Denmark comes from various land routes through other European countries. Mafia-style crime groups, including ethnic-based gangs from South America, West Africa and Southern Europe, control the market. However, their control is not particularly consolidated, as many smaller entrepreneurs and dealers are active.","text - criminal actors":"Danish police say 92 gangs and 1 314 members were operating in the country in 2017, including a number of biker gangs. While the number of gangs with criminal associations has increased in the past five years, the total number of members in the gangs has decreased since 2012. Gangs, in general, are involved in the drug markets, extortion, economic crimes, such as fraud and tax evasion, robbery, human and arms trafficking. The main market is drugs. Larger and more-organized biker gangs traffic drugs; the smaller street gangs sell the drugs or liaise with would-be buyers. These gangs solicit protection fees to shop and business owners and are involved with illicit weapons trafficking. In terms of foreign actors, mafia-style groups in the country mainly recruit among second-generation migrants in lower socioeconomic neighbourhoods. Some mafia-style groups have affiliations in multiple countries. For example, while motorcycle gangs have roots abroad, Danish chapters tend to consist of Danish citizens and many biker gangs often let the media know of their explicit Danish identity. ##&& Crime networks in Denmark tend to be connected to dominant gangs via ties with friends and family or parent crime groups abroad. These networks most commonly engage in copper and precious-metal theft, human trafficking, human smuggling, drugs and weapons trafficking. These markets typically require connections abroad, which are easily attained in Denmark, given it is an important transhipment point to the Nordics. In most cases, networks are widespread and typically connect in urban areas or at national borders, especially in Copenhagen. Some individuals involved in money laundering in financial institutions, such as Danske Bank, are suspected of belonging to crime networks. The role of the state in crime markets is limited. The level of synergy between organized gangs and the public sector in Denmark is low. Organized crime generally does not influence the police, customs or politicians and is not particularly violent.","text - leadership and governance":"The Danish government is ranked among the highest in the world for transparency and accountability. The country has several mechanisms in place to ensure effective oversight of sectors vulnerable to corruption, including the Danish Ombudsman, which investigates complaints from citizens relating to mismanagement or corruption. Although major violence erupted between Danish gangs in 2017, violence in Denmark is generally low. The nexus between organized crime and conflict can be found in criminal activities related to terrorism. In addition, extremist right-wing groups are increasingly active in the country and are capable of and willing to use violence. ##&& The government has a public stance against organized crime which prioritizes close collaboration between law- enforcement agencies and politicians in neighbouring countries. The government also has an overall effective apparatus to fight organized crime and most legislative changes in response to organized crime have been met with some degree of bipartisan support in parliament. The Danish government has taken steps to strengthen the investigative organized-crime mandates of law-enforcement agencies. Denmark\u2019s national legal framework against organized crime guides authorities in the definition of what constitutes organized crime and the criminal justice process they should engage with to deal with it. Suspected members and members of mafia-style groups risk getting twice the penalty of that of criminals who act independently, or outside of gangs through a specific 'gang-clause'. Overall, the national legislation against organized crime in Denmark receives significant attention and is regularly updated to meet the new demands of law enforcement. On an international level, Denmark has signed and ratified all the treaties relevant to fighting transnational crime. Denmark is a donor country and delivers technical assistance to other countries fighting organized crime.","text - criminal justice and security":"Overall, the Danish judicial system is well equipped to deal with most types of crime. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of convictions of members of mafia-style groups, as well as an increase in the average sentences served by these individuals. The Danish state exercises firm control over the prison system and, although there have been a few incidents involving money laundering and gang violence, they are low compared with global standards. In general, Danish prisons have a long-standing tradition of focusing on the resocialisation of prisoners into civilian life. The country's law-enforcement authorities are considered to be efficient, highly professional, well managed, well equipped and well-coordinated. Law enforcement actors are widely respected in Danish society and, aside from the occasional report of heavy-handedness, there are no indications of mistrust towards law enforcement among the public. Although there has been a rise in violent crime in the past decade, experts claim this is because of an increase in the number of people willing to report a crime rather than the actual number of crimes increasing. Regarding territorial integrity, most organized-crime operations involving people and goods take place across land borders, which are strictly controlled by the border forces. The country's capacity for border control is not compromised by any of its neighbours but rather enhanced through close collaborations. Corruption also appears to be at a low level among customs and police officials, due to good working conditions and salaries.","text - economic and financial environment":"Denmark ranks as having one of the top 10 freest economies in the world. There is no evidence that organized-crime groups have entered legal businesses on a systematic basis. Property rights are strongly protected and necessary non-market institutions, such as healthcare and strong independent judiciaries, have been present for decades, enabling the economy to see a steady growth. However, with relatively liberal legislation surrounding the use and sales of cannabis, drug markets could potentially emerge to conduct illicit activities within the framework of the legal market. Denmark has a framework for anti-money laundering and financial legislation, but not a national anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing strategy. Despite the lack of a national strategy, inspections and assessments of banks and companies, as well as the frequency of reports, have resulted in a significant increase in frequency in the past years. At the same time, financial crime appears to have been on the rise. Recent money-laundering scandals in the country have prompted the government to create a new office to address these issues.","text - civil society and social protection":"Prevention of organized crime in Denmark starts at the local level, where it is done through focusing on the youth, including educating them on the matter and providing venues where young people gather in their free time. Meanwhile, the Danish government\u2019s strategy for treatment and support for victims of organized crime places a heavy focus on human trafficking and drug use. The country\u2019s Centre against Human Trafficking is at the core of the nationwide social action to identify, support and protect victims of human trafficking. The government has a fairly robust framework in place to provide support to victims of modern slavery. ##&& With regard to drug use, the most prominent harm-reduction measures undertaken by the Danish government include fix rooms \u2014 venues where heroin users can inject for free and safely \u2014 and temporary housing services with free food and dental care. There are multiple free rehabilitation programmes for people who use drugs. Witness protection is also available and provided by the Danish Security and Intelligence Service. This includes a wide array of protective measures from security guards to change of identity. Witnesses can have cosmetic operations and be relocated to European countries. Strategies for crime prevention and reintegration explicitly rely on civil society actors and NGOs. The country has one of the highest levels of press freedom in the world.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Copenhagen","GDP (current $US million)":"350104.33","Income group":"High income","Population":"5814422","Land Area (sq. km)":"42920","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"18.8","Freedom in the World Index":"97","Human Development Index":"0.94","Global Peace Index":"1.28","Democracy Index":"9.15","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"88","GDP per capita (current US$)":"60213","1":"3.87","1.1":"3.85","1.2":"3.88","2":"8.21"},{"Corresp":"56","ISO-3":"EST","Country":"Estonia","ISO-2":"EE","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Northern Europe","Flag file":"ee.png","1.

Sexual exploitation appears to be the most common cause of trafficking, though there is evidence indicating that the crime market for sex trafficking is becoming smaller. At the same time, however, there is evidence that the market for labour trafficking might be increasing. ##&& Estonia is a transit country for smuggling migrants from Russia, Georgia and Vietnam, destined for Europe. Most smuggled persons enter Estonia through the country\u2019s eastern border with Russia. Most human smugglers are members of Russian crime groups which work in tandem with Estonian networks.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking constituted a significant threat to Estonia and, throughout the 1990s, the country had a reputation as a major hotspot for illegal arms trafficking. However, efforts to curb the illegal trafficking of firearms have been effective, resulting in a sharp decline in the size of the crime market. Estonia is now mainly a destination country for illicit arms, albeit a limited one.","text - environment":"Environment crimes are not a major concern in Estonia and criminal markets in flora and fauna are not known to exist on a large scale. Illegal forestry was a concern in the past, but Estonia now faces a low risk of harvesting illegal timber. Illegal trade in reptile skins, corals, caviar and sturgeon meat has decreased in the past years and the crime market for fauna appears to be relatively small. The country's location and history of fuel smuggling sustain some concerns with regards to the proliferation of a non-renewable resource crime market. Additionally, instances of fraud in the fuel sector have been reported. Nevertheless, the illicit non-renewable resources market has a potentially limited but manageable influence.","text - drugs":"Estonia is a transit country for heroin and a destination country for cannabis, synthetic drugs and, to a lesser extent, cocaine. It is a transit country for heroin trafficked into Europe via Russia (along the northern route). Domestic heroin consumption and trade is marginal as it has more or less been replaced first by fentanyl and, after successful action by law enforcement to combat suppliers, various synthetic drugs, including amphetamines, methamphetamines and gamma-hydroxy-butyrate (GHB). In 2020, however, something of a return of opiates, mainly fentanyl, was observed. Many of the synthetic drugs used in Estonia originate in Europe: Amphetamines and methamphetamines seized in the country often originate in Poland and the Netherlands; MDMA \u2014 also known as ecstasy or molly \u2014 is imported from the Netherlands. Fentanyl seized in Estonia often originates in China. A small proportion of Estonia\u2019s demand for synthetic drugs have been fed by domestic production and authorities have dismantled small- and medium-scale laboratories making GHB, amphetamines and fentanyl. ##&& Cannabis is consumed relatively widely in Estonia, particularly among young people. The exact criminal actors involved in the cannabis market are unknown but, in some cases, there are reports of mafia-style groups being linked to the trade. Estonia is a destination country for cocaine, though seizures indicate a moderately small market by global and European standards.","text - criminal actors":"Foreign groups, especially foreign mafias, have traditionally played a key role in most of Estonia\u2019s crime markets, including trafficking drugs, people and arms. Since the 1990s, mafia-style groups of Russian, Belarussian and Ukrainian origin have had a strong presence in Estonia. Ethnic Estonian mafia-style groups also exist, but clearly identifying them is for the most part a difficult task. The most widely recognized Estonian mafia organization is the Assar Paulus group, known by the name of its leader. In general, mafia-style groups in Estonia, both domestic and foreign, have traditionally exercised a great deal of coordination. For instance, a number of them have established a mutual fund \u2014 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0430\u043a in Russian \u2014 which functions as a committee that defines territorial divisions and settles disputes. Additionally, outlaw motorcycle gangs, such as the Hells Angels and Bandidos have also had a presence in Estonia. Recent years, however, have seen several convictions and murders of some of the most powerful individuals in Estonia\u2019s crime underworld, including Nikolai Tarankov (murdered) and Assar Paulus (arrested) \u2014 two of the most influential criminals in the country. This might have significantly weakened the unity and influence of mafia-style actors in Estonia, both foreign and domestic, effectively putting the future of the crime mutual fund into question. ##&& Criminal networks in Estonia also appear to collaborate to some extent with foreign actors. They have grown in prominence in the past years, operating predominately in the drug trafficking market but have a stake in human trafficking and smuggling as well. Cases involving state criminal actors mainly constitute white-collar crimes, such as money laundering and corruption. In general, rather than their involvement in violent and\/or drug-related crimes, state-embedded actors seem to be working in collaboration with international organized-crime groups to launder the proceeds of their criminal activities.","text - leadership and governance":"Since independence, Estonia has become a consolidated democracy with a track record of clean elections, accountable governance and a respect for its citizens\u2019 political rights that is unrivalled in any other former Soviet country. Estonia's government has shown leadership against organized crime and has adopted a number of strategies for countering key crime markets. Although corruption remains an issue, by global standards, the country performs relatively well in the fight against it. Its oversight mechanisms are generally adequate controls against corruption, though further steps to strengthen the anti-corruption framework could be taken. Transparent governance could be strengthened in a number of key areas, including political financing, lobbying, access to information and whistle-blower protection. ##&& Estonia has ratified all international legal instruments relevant to organized crime. The country cooperates with international partners through a range of international bodies, including Europol, INTERPOL and various regional bodies and task forces. It has participated in joint operations with foreign law enforcement and has extradition agreements with many countries, including the Russian Federation, the Ukraine, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and the US. The Estonian legal framework criminalizes most forms of organized crime. Its Criminal Code contains legal provisions to criminalize those who participate in organized crime, as well as human smuggling, human, drug and arms trafficking and fauna and flora crimes.","text - criminal justice and security":"Estonia's courts are independent in their activities and deliver justice with reliability. Those facing charges can generally expect a fair trial and due process. There is no evidence of corruption and organized-crime activities inside Estonian prisons. There have been a few allegations of excessive use of force by prison officers, but these issues are not symptomatic of wider issues and concern specific prisons. Law enforcement in the country has high levels of public trust and is considered relatively efficient. The Police and Border Guard Board is the main policing body, responsible for managing and coordinating the activities of various agencies of the police, including those specialized in investigating organized crime in general and units that are specialized in human trafficking, human smuggling and drug trafficking. Nevertheless, the small size of the law enforcement community in Estonia makes it hard for it to have the breadth of capabilities appropriate to respond to different types of organized crime.","text - economic and financial environment":"The economic regulatory environment in Estonia is highly conducive to doing business and to private-sector development and at providing relatively strong protection for workers. The Estonian government has legal and institutional mechanisms in place to ensure that legitimate businesses operate free from criminal activities. Even though an Estonian branch of Danske Bank was implicated in one of the largest money-laundering scandals exposed, the country has a relatively resilient anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML-CFT) framework. The country has a solid Financial Intelligence Unit and Supreme Audit Institution and relatively transparent beneficial ownership disclosure practices.","text - civil society and social protection":"The legal framework for witness protection in Estonia gives, among other things, witnesses of organized crime an opportunity to obtain a new identity.

In cases of human trafficking, NGOs often take the lead, providing victims with various services. These are funded by the state, though NGOs often have to look elsewhere for further funding. Reintegration and repatriation services are provided by state municipalities. However, Estonia does not always provide victims of human trafficking with all the mechanisms needed to exit trafficking.

Additionally, there is a legal market for small arms in Finland, and criminals are known to steal legal arms and reactivate neutralized weapons. Finland is also a transit country, albeit to a limited extent, for deactivated and reactivated Kalashnikov-type assault rifles from Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany for trafficking to Russia, which is largely carried out by organized-crime groups, as well as by politically motivated groups.

While an illicit market for non-renewable resources likely exists in Finland in relation to gold mining, there is not much in the way of publicly available evidence.","text - drugs":"Cannabis is the most commonly used and traded illicit substance in Finland, as well as the most socially acceptable drug. While Moroccan cannabis has dominated the Finnish cannabis supply for many years, there is some evidence of emerging domestic cultivation of cannabis. Unlike other illicit markets that are more directly controlled by criminal organizations, the cannabis market is often facilitated by smaller, more decentralized networks. After cannabis, synthetic drugs such as amphetamines and MDMA are the most commonly used drugs in Finland. Synthetic drugs originating in Western Europe are imported via Estonia, Lithuania, Sweden and Russia. The synthetic opioid buprenorphine (Subutex) has been used in Finland since the early 2000s, almost entirely replacing heroin. The increased availability of new psychoactive substances, usually ordered online from abroad, is one of the emerging trends on the Finnish drug scene. For the most part, synthetic drugs are imported by organized-crime groups such as outlaw motorcycle gangs or foreign organized criminals. ##&& ##&& Although cocaine seizures and consumption remain small by global standards, cocaine usage in Finland has increased steadily in recent decades. Cocaine is trafficked into Finland from the Netherlands and Belgium by organized-crime groups such as outlaw motorcycle gangs and street gangs. Finland imports only negligible amounts of heroin, and recent years have witnessed very small heroin seizures. This is most likely due to the increase in consumption of opioid substitutes.","text - criminal actors":"According to police information, there are about 90 organized crime groups in the country, most of which are domestic groups, totaling around 900 to 1 000 members. The largest groups of criminal actors in Finland are criminal networks and mafia-style outlaw motorcycle clubs. The most prominent biker gangs are the Bandidos MC, Cannonball MC, Hells Angels and the United Brotherhood. The most common activities these groups engage in are drug trafficking, money laundering, prostitution and human trafficking and smuggling, as well as, to a lesser extent, extortion. Along with mafia-style gangs, loose networks are expanding their influence in Finland. The latter are flexible, which allows them to relatively easily modify their organizational structure to fit a specific situation and collaborate with foreign groups, mostly Russian and groups from the Baltic states. ##&& Foreign criminal actors active in Finland are transnational organisations involving nationals from a range of Eastern European and African countries, including Albania, Romania, Russia and Nigeria. These actors tend to be active in the criminal markets for human trafficking and drug smuggling. Additionally, foreign motorcycle gangs such as Outlaws MC, the Shark Riders MC, Satudarah MC and No Surrender MC (among others) also have a presence in Finland.

The government is committed to international and European cooperation and has signed a number of extradition agreements with countries outside the EU, including the US, Canada and Australia. Additionally, Finland is an important donor country and has a strong track record of contributing to international development cooperation related to combating transnational organized crime. Unlike other countries in the west, Finland still retains working law-enforcement cooperation with the Russian Federation.

Moreover, Finnish organized-crime groups are known to be involved in sectors such as construction, car retail, transport, airport maintenance, property maintenance and nightclubs in order to launder the proceeds of crime.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Finnish government, in cooperation with civil society, has implemented several mechanisms for victims and offers a full witness-protection programme. The Finnish state is committed to providing support and rehabilitation treatment for drug users through the national healthcare system and public and private rehabilitation facilities. Although both the state and civil society have implemented mechanisms for protecting human-trafficking victims, key gaps remain in the capacity to respond to the issues \u2013 particularly for groups who fear repercussions from seeking assistance. Finland has a number of crime-prevention strategies and policies in place. Finland also has an EXIT programme run by law enforcement in cooperation with civil-society organisations that assists individuals who wish to leave a criminal organization or livelihoods based on criminal markets. The state allows the media broad access to investigate and report on organized crime, providing top-level crime reports on request.

Victims primarily are women and girls from Eastern Europe, East and West Africa and some Asian countries trafficked into sexual exploitation, as well as men, women and children forced into domestic servitude and other forms of forced labour. Human trafficking in France is generally also associated with both physical and psychological violence, as well as unlawful confinement. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been cases of trafficked individuals taking on dangerous and degrading work to obtain cash during the lockdowns. ##&& France is a key transit and destination country for human smuggling. Smuggling activities have increased in northern France, particularly in the port city of Ouistreham in Normandy, since the closure of the migrant camps in Calais. Human smuggling across France\u2019s borders with Italy and Spain, as well as across the English Channel between France and the UK, are also of major concern. Additionally, France\u2019s overseas territories are increasingly being utilized as entry points for human smuggling activities, with Mayotte off the coast of southeastern Africa being the most affected region, followed by French Guiana. Smuggling networks also provide individuals with fake medical certificates and forged documents. Furthermore, there is an overlap between human smuggling, drug trafficking, sex trafficking and weapons trafficking. Since the end of 2018, attempts at irregular migration from Africa, the Middle East and Southern Asia across the English Channel have multiplied due to police restraint aimed at preventing migrant camps from emerging near Calais.","text - trade":"There is a steady flow of illicit weapons into and within France, primarily originating from Eastern Europe and the US. Targeted weapon theft contributes to the bulk of illicit weapons in the market, which are mainly bought by actors involved in organized crime, especially drug trafficking. Firearms are also sometimes exchanged for drugs. In 2018, France experienced the largest number of weapon thefts across the EU, in the form of both opportunistic and targeted theft. France continues to experience the worrying trend of weapons entering the country in increasing numbers, especially from the Balkans. Intelligence services highlight that weapons used during the two world wars, as well as weapons originating from the Balkan region, are often utilized to fuel criminal networks. Additionally, access to war weapons, such as AK-47s, enabled terrorist groups to attack civilians in France and also fuelled violence in suburbs where young people have easy access to arms. In mainland France, weapons are sold on both the dark web and the clearnet.","text - environment":"There is little evidence to suggest that a criminal market for flora exists in mainland France. However, imports of illicit African timber by French firms constitute the risk of flora-related crimes given the prevalence of illicit activity in the supply chain. France has also been accused of not doing enough to enforce EU timber regulations. Additionally, French Guiana has seen an increase in logging in early 2020 as illegal miners have taken advantage of the COVID crisis to engage in illegal clearances. In regard to fauna crimes, hundreds of protected species are seized in France every year. The country, and specifically Charles de Gaulle Airport, is considered a major transit and destination hub for the bushmeat market, as there are many direct flights between France and Africa and Asia. In addition to bushmeat, live wild animals are also trafficked into France. Moreover, the country is a major importer of tigers and is among the five largest importers of reptile skins worldwide. Glass eel trafficking has been flagged as an issue involving Asian nationals. Groups involved in fauna trafficking use bribery and corruption to facilitate trans-shipment. In terms of non-renewable resource crimes, France is an important destination country for the criminal market, particularly illegal gold from French Guiana. Illegal gold mining in French Guiana is widespread and related to crime groups, violence and other serious crimes that significantly impact society. Gold trafficking from France to other European countries also takes place. There are numerous instances of metal theft in France. Crime groups target different sectors, and there have been cases of the looting of wind turbines, motorways, football stadiums, cemeteries and railways. Often, foreign groups are involved in such large-scale theft. Overall, non-renewable resource crimes may constitute a major source of financing for mafias and terrorist groups.","text - drugs":"The illegal drug trade in France is dominated by cannabis, as it is the number one drug consumed in France. The market has grown exponentially in recent years and is controlled by a few kingpins. It is difficult to uncover as it is fragmented and transnational. The consumption of marijuana over resin has also grown as older cannabis users seek organic and local products. This phenomenon led to an increase in self-production, which led to criminal networks reorganizing their structures by offering primarily marijuana instead of hash. However, the growing use and production of French and European marijuana did not cause a decline in the traditional Moroccan hash market. France is also a transit and destination country for marijuana. Cannabis from Morocco is transited through Spain to France and then transported to the rest of Europe by car, bus or truck. The cocaine market is the second-largest drug market in France, with it being a destination country for cocaine from South and Central America. There are two primary entry routes for cocaine: the port of Le Havre in the north of the country, and French Guiana, where cocaine is transported by road from Suriname and then flown to Paris by individuals or sent through the mail. Furthermore, France is a transit country for cocaine transported to the UK or the Netherlands. Given the proliferation of cocaine in France, tackling cocaine trafficking, along with cannabis trafficking, has become a main law enforcement priority for authorities. ##&& Heroin trafficking and consumption are on the rise in France. A decrease in heroin prices has led to an increase in consumption, along with a change from injecting to sniffing and smoking. French networks involved in the heroin trade do not work directly with large production and transit countries, as the majority of small networks buy the drug from neighbouring countries. Traffickers buy heroin in Belgium or the Netherlands before redistributing it across the country. Heroin is mostly produced in Afghanistan, and proceeds from the Afghan sources are reportedly occasionally used to finance terrorism. France\u2019s northern department are affected by the illegal heroin trade due to their proximity to trafficking hubs in the Netherlands. Lille is also a major hub for heroin trafficking in France. With regard to synthetic drugs, France is a transit and destination country for MDMA. The drugs are predominantly produced in Belgium, Luxembourg or the Netherlands. In recent years, new psychoactive substances, mainly produced in Asia, are bought and sold online. Overall, France hosts one of the largest markets in Europe and the synthetic-drug trade is on the rise in the country, especially in festival environments, with the darknet and social media serving as major selling platforms.","text - criminal actors":"The organized crime landscape in France is dominated by criminal networks with little to no structure. Mapping the activity of small, loose criminal networks, as well as individual criminals, is difficult due to the country\u2019s shift in focus from organized crime towards terrorism in 2015. Nevertheless, criminal networks exist in France and primarily operate in Lille, Paris, Lyon, Grenoble, Marseille and Corsica. These criminal networks are gangs from the suburbs that are involved in drug trafficking, primarily in the cannabis trade, as well as arms trafficking. Meanwhile, French intelligence notes that mafia-style groups in France operate discreetly and are often overlooked, while the scale of their activities is misunderstood. There is reportedly a high rate of mafia infiltration in legitimate bar, restaurant, tourism and hospitality businesses; construction, waste management, low-skilled public and commercial services; and agricultural sectors. These groups tend to be involved in poly-criminality and are often characterised by ethnicity or loyalty to a specific city, and often have links to drug trafficking groups. ##&& In France, there are signs that cooperation exists between both foreign and local criminal actors involved in money laundering. Foreign mafias are also present in France. Some believe that in addition to geographical proximity, legislative shortcomings in France have facilitated the Italian mafia taking root in France. Nigerian mafias, along with other Eastern European criminal groups that also dominate arms trafficking operations from the Balkan region, control the sexual exploitation market in France. Organized crime groups from Eastern Europe are also active in organized property crime, sexual exploitation, drug trafficking and cyber fraud. Meanwhile, state-embedded actors exist and mostly engage in money laundering, tax evasion and corruption, with many recorded cases occurring in the past 10 years. Furthermore, some politico-financial affairs linking state-embedded actors to criminal activities have transnational components.","text - leadership and governance":"In general, French citizens lack faith in the government, as evidenced by multiple demonstrations and strikes against the government since 2015. Moreover, the French government is threatened by so-called \u2018soft corruption\u2019, a series of small arrangements tolerated in practice. Since 2014, the French government has been required to implement national action plans every two years, which focus on transparency, integrity and accountability in public and economic life. France also has two independent authorities that oversee government action. Nevertheless, information access remains poor and France has been called on to reinforce its anti-corruption policies. ##&& On the international level, France is a state party to all relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. France also has a number of bilateral and multilateral security cooperation agreements and is one of only a few countries that have been and continue to be involved in subregional, regional and global initiatives. As far as international cooperation on mafia-related cases is concerned, however, it was reported in 2016 that exchanging information with France on such cases was difficult. A prime reason for this was the lack of political will, along with the fact that officials were reluctant to recognize the existence of mafia-style groups. On a domestic level, French legislation does not specifically define organized crime. However, the country\u2019s criminal code lists the various offences that constitute organized crime when committed by organized gangs. France also has a law that reinforces the fight against organized crime, terrorism and terrorist financing, and enhances the guarantees of penal procedure.","text - criminal justice and security":"In France, there are eight specialized inter-regional jurisdictions with competences over drug trafficking, organized crime and financial crimes. They are based in Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Paris, Nancy, Rennes and Fort-de-France. In 2019, a new national anti-terrorism prosecution office was also created, as a result of political will to adapt the judicial system to new trends in transnational organized crime. France\u2019s prisons have also been criticized for inhumane detention conditions such as overcrowding, squalor, poor hygiene, absence of privacy and lack of activities, and allegedly run the risk of radicalizing prisoners. With regard to law enforcement, the French police and gendarmerie are in charge of combating organized crime, including drug trafficking, irregular immigration and cybercrime. The national police also has various bodies in charge of the fight against organized crime. In recent years, the relationship between the French police and the population has changed. Despite the fact that the police were deemed trusted heroes after the 2015 terror attacks in Paris, a few months after this there was a shift following numerous reports of police violence during anti-labour reform demonstrations. In 2020, trust in security forces deteriorated even further, with the Ombudsman calling the loss in confidence a crisis. In terms of territorial integrity, with France being part of the Schengen zone, many traffickers have taken advantage of the lack of EU border controls to enter France. Moreover, French territories abroad render the border increasingly porous, as authorities have difficulties containing illicit flows into French Guiana and from there into mainland Europe. Within France, territorial integrity is often compromised in the suburbs of major cities.","text - economic and financial environment":"Overall, the French economy is more regulated than the economies of other EU countries. France has made numerous efforts to reduce regulatory burdens and in 2013, the government launched a radical administrative streamlining and regulatory reform agenda. Nevertheless, France\u2019s economic regulatory environment is highly conducive to business and the size of the informal economy as a percentage of GDP is among the smallest in Europe. France is highly resilient to money laundering and terrorist financing. Its internal anti-money laundering legal and regulatory framework was substantially improved in 2016. Banks and credit institutions, as well as real estate agents, investment and insurance companies, are now subject to strict reporting and due diligence requirements. In 2018, the country also adopted a law to enhance the detection of fraud and strengthen the measures used to tackle tax evasion.","text - civil society and social protection":"France has a department responsible for access to law, justice and victim support. There is also a federation of victim support associations called the French Victim Support and Mediation Institute. However, the country does not have a legal definition for the notion of \u2018victim of crime\u2019. France has sustained its efforts to tackle human trafficking, shown by the increase in investigations, convictions and the identification of victims, and the approval of a new anti-human trafficking action plan in 2014. An interministerial mission was also set up for the protection of women against violence and the fight against human trafficking. Funds are allocated for the prevention of prostitution and for the provision of social and professional support to victims of sexual exploitation and human trafficking. Nevertheless, the provision of adequate resources to France\u2019s anti-trafficking committee and the deployment of sufficient efforts to counter labour trafficking remain areas for improvement. At the same time, France is very active in combating and preventing organized crime at European and international levels. It has proposed enhanced security cooperation through the creation of common investigative teams and has engaged with South American nations to tackle the issue of deforestation. Anti-mafia activists in France have also argued that civil society suffers from a low awareness of the organized-crime phenomenon. With regard to the press in France, an increase in harassment and attacks targeting news media and journalists was reported in 2018, mainly at the hands of protesters and riot police during the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protests. Along with that, journalists were also increasingly exposed to online harassment by internet trolls, and a great number of lawsuits continue to be brought against investigative journalists. Despite this, however, overall the country maintains a high level of media freedom.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Paris","GDP (current $US million)":"2715518.27","Income group":"High income","Population":"67055854","Land Area (sq. km)":"549087","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"32.5","Freedom in the World Index":"90","Human Development Index":"0.9","Global Peace Index":"1.93","Democracy Index":"7.99","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"69","GDP per capita (current US$)":"40496","1":"5.67","1.1":"5.70","1.2":"5.63","2":"6.83"},{"Corresp":"65","ISO-3":"DEU","Country":"Germany","ISO-2":"DE","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Western Europe","Flag file":"de.png","1.

While there is a large, parallel legal market for prostitution in Germany, an estimated one in seven sex workers is a victim of trafficking. In terms of labour exploitation, Germany serves as a destination country for human trafficking, particularly in the construction sector. While there is no evidence of German citizens being trafficked abroad, they are reportedly exploited in the domestic market. The country\u2019s human trafficking market is characterized by a high degree of diversity, including various criminal structures and suspects from different countries of origin, including Germany. Victims and perpetrators of trafficking for organized forced begging, shoplifting and pickpocketing are reported to be mostly foreign nationals. ##&& Overall, the human smuggling market in Germany appears to be transnationally organized but very fragmented, involving several different organized criminal groups consisting mainly of foreign nationals but also some German citizens. Although irregular migration flows have decreased significantly since 2015, Germany remains one of the principal destination countries in Europe, particularly along the central and eastern Mediterranean routes. The main hotspot for human smuggling is the German\u2013Austrian border, where the secondary migration routes from Italy and Greece converge. Smuggled individuals are most commonly concealed in cars, vans and trucks, sometimes under unsafe or fatal conditions. In general, human smuggling is a highly politicized topic in Germany and often overlaps with discussions about immigration, xenophobia, right-wing political extremism and violent extremism.","text - trade":"Germany\u2019s illegal arms market involves transnationally organized groups and individual actors. The transnationally organized groups involved in the market smuggle weapons, particularly from the Western Balkans, to EU countries, with Germany being a transit as well as a destination country. Meanwhile, individual actors illegally trade small numbers of stolen or legally acquired weapons. Overall, the principal source of arms, ammunition and explosives trafficked to Germany appears to be the Western Balkan region by land, taking advantage of the so-called \u2018ant trade\u2019, whereby multiple shipments of small volumes of weapons are trafficked. These eventually accumulate into a substantial stockpile of illicit weapons. More recently, growing evidence suggests that illegal weapons are trafficked from Ukraine into Germany, often for re-export to third countries. However, organized-crime groups are increasingly shifting their traditional structures and activities to the deep web and the darknet. There are also various cases of individuals or small groups engaged in the reconstruction and reactivation of legally obtainable, disarmed decorative weapons, which are then sold and mailed to various countries.","text - environment":"Germany is, to a minor extent, a destination country for specific rare plant species, such as cacti and orchids, as well as dietary supplements made from rare plants. In 2019, a German company was also found to have repeatedly and knowingly violated EU timber regulations. More importantly, Germany is considered a key transit country for illegal wildlife, such as ivory, pangolins and live animals, with Frankfurt and Leipzig airports the main airfreight hubs between Africa and Asia. Like several other Western European countries, Germany also has a long-standing illicit market for reptiles and birds. The main actors involved in flora-related crimes are collectors of rare and protected species, and tourists who illegally import souvenirs. The latter is the largest group in terms of the number of fauna crime offences and seizures, and professional and internationally organized smugglers are considered rare. Finally, the criminal market for non-renewable resources is likewise fairly limited, but German companies are involved in mining-related crimes abroad and the country plays a minor role in gold-related crimes as well as tax fraud crimes concerning diesel fuel.","text - drugs":"Germany is a destination and transit country for heroin trafficking on the Balkan and southern routes. The heroin market in Germany is interconnected with other criminal markets, such as cocaine and cannabis, and the criminal actors involved overlap. Organized criminal groups involved in heroin trafficking are transnationally organized and often connected to groups based in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, mafia-style groups are engaged in every stage of the trade, smuggling, distribution and money laundering. Although corruption is not a widespread phenomenon, there have been reports of mafia-style groups bribing low-level officials regarding the drug market. Heroin is considered to be the cause of the highest number of substance-related deaths in Germany. The most widespread drug market in Germany is the cocaine market, with the country acting as a destination and transit point for cocaine trafficking. While cocaine is smuggled to and from Germany along myriad routes, the largest proportion of cocaine enters through the port of Hamburg in ships originating from South America. There are fears that rising cocaine production in South America and rising import volumes in Germany could lead to increased conflicts between competing crime groups. ##&& Furthermore, Germany is a source, transit and destination country for cannabis. Although there are independent domestic producers in Germany, the market appears to be dominated by mafia-style groups connected to transnational trafficking networks. A substantial share of the cannabis intended for the Western European market is trafficked through Germany, with the help of foreign organized criminal groups. Lastly, Germany is also a transit and destination country for synthetic drugs. Germany plays a significant and growing role in connection with substances destined for producers in the Netherlands, which, in many cases, originate from Poland. Generally, the smuggling of base substances, the production and the inflow of various synthetic drugs for the German consumer market appear to be closely connected to groups and networks operating in and from the Netherlands. Based on the number of consumption-related offences, amphetamine is the most widespread drug in Germany, alongside cannabis. The methamphetamine market in particular has experienced an expansion in the eastern regions of the country in recent years.","text - criminal actors":"Since the 1970s, Germany\u2019s criminal markets have been dominated by informal networks of criminals, loosely connected to each other. Investigations of organized-crime groups in Germany revealed that a third of all investigated groups were dominated and\/or led by German citizens, and a third of these German-led groups comprise German members entirely. The only groups that can be identified by name are outlaw motorcycle criminal groups (OMCGs). These mafia-style groups have a defined leadership. In many cities, territory relevant to criminal markets is partitioned among competing mafia-style groups, most of whom are involved in multiple criminal markets. OMCGs are reported to engage in extortion related to offering private security services to businesses, particularly in the nightlife sector. OMCGs are among the groups with the highest prevalence of physical violence, used against competing groups as well as other victims. ##&& Non-German citizens lead the majority of investigated organized crime groups in Germany and are involved in nearly every criminal market in the country. Often, family and ethnic ties define these groups. The trade in illegal drugs continues to be a central field of activity for certain non-German clans, primarily the international trade of cocaine and marijuana. Direct links to the South American production sites are documented, as well as involvement in the financing, transport or distribution of drugs. Italian mafia groups also have a strong presence in the country, where they engage predominantly in drug trafficking and money laundering. To that end, they have managed to infiltrate the legitimate economy of Germany. There is no evidence of state-embedded criminal actors or groups, but there have been recent reports of right-wing extremism within the police force and the military, and right-wing terrorists\u2019 alleged connections to intelligence and law enforcement.","text - leadership and governance":"The German government and its security and law enforcement institutions cite organized crime as a constant challenge, despite promoting their ongoing efforts at combating the phenomenon. Their efforts include issuing yearly situation reports on organized crime, as well as on specific criminal topics. Nevertheless, there appears to be three main issues of concern regarding the effectiveness of governance in the fight against organized crime: public authorities\u2019 lack of control over certain parts of German cities; the apparent rise of right-wing extremism and terrorism, and their ties to security forces; and Germany\u2019s role as a money-laundering hotspot. Overall, the level of corruption in Germany is perceived to be fairly low. The government also issues a yearly report on the prevention of corruption in public administration, alongside various guidelines, and there is also an ombudsperson against corruption. Nevertheless, there has been criticism regarding the regulation of financial contributions to political parties, as well as the possible conflicts of interest of politicians. ##&& Germany is a signatory party to all relevant multilateral treaties concerning organized crime. Furthermore, it is involved in various international efforts to prevent and combat organized crime, in particular in providing funding to organizations working to tackle organized crime. However, with regard to cooperation between Germany and Italy on the case of mafia groups, Italian counterparts have often reported problems. Domestic legislation covers a broad scope of organized-crime forms, including human trafficking and smuggling, as well as arms and drug trafficking and various forms of environmental crime. However, in Germany, there is only a \u2018working definition\u2019 of organized crime, which is very general and mostly serves to allocate police responsibilities and distribute resources.","text - criminal justice and security":"Germany ranks high with regard to the effectiveness of its criminal justice system. The country receives high appraisals of all subcomponents, including the absence of corruption and political influence in the criminal justice system, and the effectiveness of the correctional system. Trust in the justice system is high overall, but is much lower in the eastern parts of Germany compared to the west. Research suggests that there is more corruption inside detention facilities than formally recognized. The German police as well as the prosecution services and courts have specialized departments and units dedicated to tackling organized crime. The federal criminal police office, in conjunction with its state-level counterparts and state police offices, has the jurisdiction to conduct investigations relating to trafficking in human beings, weapons, ammunition, explosives, drugs and other illicit commodities. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are generally trusted and effective, but there has been criticism of a lack of funding constraining the effectiveness of criminal investigations into organized crimes. There is no evidence of border control being compromised by neighbouring countries and very little information about corruption within customs or border police. Despite this, German borders are difficult to monitor and fairly porous.","text - economic and financial environment":"Legitimate private businesses are generally able to operate free from criminal activities in all sectors of the economy. However, foreign criminal groups, in particular Italian mafia groups, have heavily invested in the formal economy \u2013 in sectors such as the restaurant industry primarily \u2013 as a front for money laundering. Other legal markets, such as real estate, are also vulnerable to money laundering. The country\u2019s agency responsible for combating money laundering has been criticized since 2017 for its ineffectiveness, caused by severe underfinancing and understaffing. Due to the wide acceptance of cash payments, Germany is considered an ideal site for organized crime groups to launder money. In spite of these issues, overall Germany is considered to be among the countries that are more resilient to money laundering and terrorist financing.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government has a fairly robust framework in place to provide support to victims to exit modern slavery. There are wide-ranging programmes with regard to witness protection, support for sex workers, victims of forced prostitution and other crimes, and an ombudsperson against corruption, among others. However, most of the support programmes are implemented at a federal level, poorly budgeted for, and cannot provide sufficient support. The country also has several state initiatives and institutions in place to prevent organized crime. Independent and investigative journalism plays a key role in uncovering criminal activities, including human trafficking, human smuggling, the drug trade, mafia-style groups, corruption and white collar crime. Despite decreasing revenues, the German media landscape continues to be relatively healthy. However, there have been worrying trends since 2015, as far-right groups have threatened, harassed and even physically assaulted journalists. Additionally, a 2017 law has been perceived as threatening platform providers with fines if they fail to remove \u2018clearly illegal\u2019 content quickly.

These illicit arms are often unloaded in Gavdos, having been trafficked from Libya, Lebanon, Israel and Egypt. Greece is also a transit country for illicit arms on their way to other destination countries such as Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Libya, as well as to the European Union. Suppliers are typically organized-crime groups involved in a variety of criminal activities. Independent actors work on an ad-hoc basis with criminal groups in need of weapons. There have been seizures of arms shipments found on vessels transiting Greek territorial waters; and there are also reports of arms being packaged alongside legal products and delivered through private courier companies from Crete to other Greek islands. Beyond these traditional channels, the darknet is also commonly used to purchase illicit firearms.","text - environment":"Greece is a source and transit country for fauna-related crimes. Songbirds are the most frequently poached wildlife in the country. The market is fuelled by domestic demand in cities like Athens and Thessaloniki. There is no evidence of a well-developed criminal market for flora in Greece. The most significant flora-related crime, illegal logging, accounts for less than 1% of all logging. Austerity measures and rising fuel prices have resulted in a considerable increase in illegal felling for fuelwood. Firewood is of great value to the inhabitants of remote regions in Greece, who seek a cheap and accessible heating solution. As a result, illegal logging is perceived as socially acceptable in these areas. Reports suggest that Albanian organized-crime groups are heavily involved in this criminal activity. The Epirus region is the most vulnerable due to its geographical proximity to the Albanian border. ##&& Greece is known as a transit country for a variety of non-renewable resource crimes, including petroleum and aluminium smuggling. These resources are smuggled into Europe via Greece, as well as from Europe via Greece to Turkey. The opening of the Skouries mine in 2019 has increased concerns about potential non-renewable-resource crimes.","text - drugs":"Greece is a transit, destination and source country for cannabis, which is the most widely trafficked and consumed drug in the country. Albania supplies cannabis to most European countries via the Greece-Italy route. High numbers of cannabis seizures take place within the areas of Thesprotia and Ioannina, both of which border Albania. Many of the organized-crime groups in Greece who are involved in the cannabis trade are also involved in arms trafficking, human smuggling, money laundering and forgery. Greece is also a transit and destination country for the heroin trade, which is operated mainly by local organized-crime groups, who collaborate with transnational crime groups. The country serves as an entry point for the Balkan route, which links trafficking corridors from areas with the highest production of opioids in the world with consumer countries in Europe. Law-enforcement officials have noted an increase in the use of an alternative route from Turkey to Greece and into Bulgaria, Albania or North Macedonia. Domestically, Attica, Thessaloniki, Epirus, the Ionian Islands and Crete have all been highlighted as heroin-trade hotspots. Heroin is transported across land, air and sea corridors, with the drug crossing borders illegally via commercial flights, air couriers, postal services and small boats. ##&& Greece is a transit and, to a lesser extent, destination country for shipments of cocaine arriving directly from South America or indirectly via Spain and Italy. Cocaine is usually smuggled in container ships transporting legal imports. The Greek port of Piraeus, one of the largest container ports in Europe, is the primary entry point for cocaine being smuggled into the country. Greece acts as a gateway for Latin American organized-crime groups to gain access to European markets. The majority of organizations in the cocaine trade are poly-drug groups that traffic mainly cannabis. Demand for cocaine within Greece is concentrated in the larger cities like Athens, Thessaloniki and Piraeus. Greece is primarily a transit country for synthetic drugs travelling from the Netherlands or Bulgaria to Turkey. Greece is also increasingly becoming a destination country for synthetic drugs, particularly for consumption by young people and tourists. Reports suggest that the main actors involved in this market are independent low-level dealers, although larger organized groups are also implicated.","text - criminal actors":"Mafia-style groups in Greece are known to be involved in arms and drug trafficking. Local groups are reported to control the illicit cigarette, alcohol and fuel markets. The most prominent domestic mafia-style groups in Greece are the so-called Godfathers of the Night \u2013 local business owners, usually of nightclubs or establishments associated with the tourism industry, who run criminal network from their properties. These groups actively engages in extortion as one of their primary activities, particularly at bars and nightclubs. Mafia-style groups in Greece have access to weapons, and the many violent altercations between mafia-style groups have included the use of firearms. Although traditional organized-crime groups in Greece employ a strict hierarchical structure, a more flexible model has recently been developed within the smaller networks, focusing more on particular operations. Loose criminal networks are prevalent in the country and are involved in every major criminal market. These networks often engage in retaliatory assassinations with multiple causes, such as turf wars or revealing information about rival groups after being apprehended. ##&& Operations undertaken to dismantle organized-crime groups have identified police officers as members. Many groups have maintained strong relationships with political elites and magistrates, evident by the lack of prosecutions for crimes such as drug trafficking. There is also evidence of corrupt politicians awarding public-procurement contracts to companies from which they have received bribes. Foreign mafia-style groups in Greece are involved in various criminal markets, including the trafficking of humans, arms and drugs. Foreign actors operate mainly along Greece's border with Albania and, more recently, Turkey, as well as on the Aegean Sea as a whole. The two largest urban centres in the country, Athens and Thessaloniki, have been epicentres of illicit activity carried out by foreign criminal actors, particularly heroin and cocaine trafficking.","text - leadership and governance":"Greece\u2019s current government claims to have taken a harder stance against organized crime than previous administrations, particularly with regard to drug trafficking. However, its anti-crime policy seems to focus more on street crimes, which are more visible and involve lower-level actors, than on large criminal organizations. The government has also targeted white-collar crime and nepotism as part of its anti-crime initiative. Nevertheless, it remains common to bypass bureaucracy and take part in corruption by offering bribes to public servants \u2013 for example, for swifter processing of paperwork. While some progress has been made in recent years, many problems remain, including the absence of a strong legal framework to counteract corruption, inefficient administrative controls and penal investigations, and the lack of a culture of accountability and meritocracy in the public sector. ##&& Greece has signed and ratified all relevant international treaties and conventions applicable to organized crime, including the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. It has also signed multiple bilateral treaties pertaining to extradition and mutual legal assistance. Greece has an organization that recovers assets and funds derived from cross-border crimes and cooperates with the relevant departments of other EU member states. Greek law enforcement usually cooperates with other countries to conduct investigations and seizures related to organized crime. On a domestic level, Greece\u2019s legal framework covers all criminal markets. Legislative reforms in recent years include the criminalization of acts committed by individuals for the benefit of smugglers and traffickers. However, a 2018 report on organized crime drafted by the Greek police did not refer to fauna, flora or non-renewable-resource crimes, despite information suggesting that Greek organized-crime groups were involved in these criminal markets.","text - criminal justice and security":"The independence of Greece's courts is perceived to be lacking. The judicial process is frequently delayed for considerable periods of time and is prone to political influence and corruption, while irregular payments and bribes are often made in return for favourable judgments. No prisons in Greece have the technology to detect drugs or weapons. The Greek prison mafia dominates the prison system and continues its operations in and out of the prison system. The Greek police work towards combating all forms of crime, especially organized crime and terrorism. However, owing to an increase in criminality attributable to the economic and migrant crisis, and the failure to revise the police-training system since 1994, they struggle to carry out functions not officially prescribed in their policing duties. ##&& Given its vast coastline and islands, Greece has numerous remote and porous entry and exit points that are vulnerable to criminal activity. Due to its geographic position, the country offers an ideal gateway to Europe for traffickers and smugglers from other parts of the world. The Greek coastguard is faced with the challenge of identifying the ever-changing entry and exit points used by smugglers and traffickers. The weakest point is found along the Aegean coast, between Greece and Turkey. In response to the increase in irregular migrants, there has been an effort to improve patrols along the Greek-Turkish border. Another weak spot is Greece's border with Albania.","text - economic and financial environment":"Anti-money-laundering initiatives exist in Greece, and are enforced by governmental and quasi-governmental bodies. Different entities for each sector in which money laundering takes place are regulated by the appropriate structure. The use of financial intelligence by the Greek authorities has been described as effective, and they have been known to investigate complex organized-crime groups that partake in money laundering. Greece has identified the risk of money laundering as medium-high, particularly in the legal sector, real estate, money and value-transfer services, and nightlife institutions. The European Semester for economic policy coordination monitors economic policies and developments in Greece. They are also assessed in terms of the enhanced surveillance framework established by the EU. Excessive bureaucracy and regulations hamper business expansion. Nevertheless, since Greece's return to the international financial market in 2018, the government has been able to attract new investors and businesses to the country.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim support in Greece is inaccessible but efforts for improvement are made, especially in human trafficking victims support. The country operationalized a national referral of mechanisms for victims to support services. In addition, training programmes on human trafficking for police officers have increased, cooperation with civil-society organizations has improved, and there are a number of multilingual helplines that operate around the clock. However, there have been reports of illegal, violent pushbacks on part of the Greek coastguard against refugees at sea, which allegedly have become standard practice since 2020. While witness protection legislation exists, the treatment of protected witnesses within the criminal justice system has been problematic. Significant gaps in the coverage of whistle-blower protection legislation have been identified, most notably that the whistle-blower status can be revoked at any given point in time. National anti-organized crime efforts in Greece focus mainly on repressive measures, rather than on developing social crime prevention strategies. Private companies and NGOs have implemented publicity campaigns aimed at making civilians more aware of organized crime. However, the highly politicized and semi-military nature of the Greek police has negatively affected prevention efforts. ##&& On the whole, civil society in Greece is weak, but there are several NGOs, some of which are supported by the state, that tackle issues such as human trafficking and illegal drugs. There have been some positive developments in media freedom in recent years, including support from parliament to bolster media diversity and the passing of legislation to reform the television-licensing industry and increase competitiveness. Nevertheless, there is a lack of critical commentary on issues of importance.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Athens","GDP (current $US million)":"209852.76","Income group":"High income","Population":"10717169","Land Area (sq. km)":"131960","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"54.5","Freedom in the World Index":"87","Human Development Index":"0.89","Global Peace Index":"1.88","Democracy Index":"7.39","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"50","GDP per capita (current US$)":"19581","1":"4.93","1.1":"4.10","1.2":"5.75","2":"5.25"},{"Corresp":"75","ISO-3":"HUN","Country":"Hungary","ISO-2":"HU","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Central & Eastern Europe","Flag file":"hu.png","1.

As is common, victimization is rooted in poverty and inequality in the labour market. Victims are lured with promises and then trafficked into Western Europe. Roma women, young women with weak family ties as well as children from state-provided childcare institutions and correctional facilities are particularly vulnerable to trafficking. Hungarian women might also be lured into fake marriages to third-country nationals in Europe, but subsequently fall victim to forced prostitution. Reportedly, traffickers use both psychological abuse and threats of violence to keep women dependent on them. Evidence suggests that international organized-crime groups are involved in human trafficking, but Hungarian nationals are a part of these networks as well. Besides domestic victims trafficked abroad, foreign nationals also pass through Hungary to be exploited in Western Europe. As such, the Hungarian\u2013Ukrainian border is highly vulnerable to trafficking flows. ##&& Although human smuggling has decreased since a peak in 2015, Hungary remains an important route for smuggling. For the most part, smuggling flows have come through the Hungarian\u2013Serbian border, although there has been a recent displacement and irregular migrants are now increasingly moving from Serbia to Hungary via Romania. The border with Slovenia has been a source of tension as well, with irregular migrants continuing their journey through there, facilitated by smugglers. The market is dominated by Serbian, Turkish and Hungarian smugglers, but other nationals are also involved.","text - trade":"The illicit arms trade is a prominent market in Hungary, with the country identified as a source, transit and destination point for illegal weapons. Weapons coming from Hungary or Eastern Europe are, for the most part, trafficked to neighbouring countries and Western Europe. The availability of arms in Hungary is the result of surplus weapons entering the illicit market following the Balkan conflicts during the 1990s and the collapse of Hungarian firearm manufacturing in the wake of the end of the Cold War. Both small arms and light weapons and military-grade weapons have been trafficked through the country. Because of their availability without a license, blank-firing weapons have been trafficked to other European countries, where they are converted to live-fire and sold illegally. Various actors engage in arms trafficking. Arms manufacturers have been accused of selling illegal firearms \u2013 mainly stockpiles of old military weapons \u2013 through intermediaries. Hungarian nationals as well as foreign criminal actors engage in the trafficking of arms in the country. Sources also report that far-right groups have also been involved in arms trafficking in Hungary.","text - environment":"Although seizures of protected plant species have been recorded in Hungary, the flora crimes market does not appear to be a significant issue in the country. Conversely, illegal wildlife trafficking and poaching have emerged as more problematic. The country has seen shipments of illegal ivory transiting through its territory, but further information on the dynamics of the flows is unavailable. Nevertheless, other species, such as quail, are regularly trafficked through Hungary towards southern and Western Europe. Over the past twenty years, poaching in Hungary has become increasingly organized and sophisticated. Poaching gangs now use state-of-the-art equipment and weaponry, with a number of court cases signalling stronger ties between poachers and both domestic and international trafficking rings. Illegal breeders, particularly in rural areas, breed purebred pups in Hungary and subsequently smuggle them to central and Western Europe either without proper paperwork or with falsified documents. There is no information to indicate illegal extraction of oil, gas or minerals in Hungary, but stolen gold has been trafficked into Hungary, melted and sold in the legal market in the country.","text - drugs":"Hungary has long been positioned as a transit point for Afghan heroin trafficked along the Balkan route to Western Europe. Turkish organized-crime groups continue to be the main importers and facilitators of heroin distribution in Hungary, often utilizing the northern branch of the Balkan route from Bulgaria and Romania to Hungary and onwards for transportation. However, most of the heroin is likely entering via the western branch of the Balkan route. The cocaine market is likely the smallest drug market in the country, although an increase has been observed in recent years. Cocaine is mainly transported via land from Spain or the Netherlands, or directly imported via air from South America. ##&& Herbal cannabis is Hungary\u2019s most commonly used illicit narcotic generally, and herbal cannabis and resin are the most seized drugs. The market has both domestic groups and foreign actors involved, with established ties between the two. More specifically, Vietnamese organized-crime groups based in the Czech Republic, groups from the Western Balkans \u2013 mostly Albanian \u2013 and organisations from the Netherlands reportedly engage in cannabis trafficking in Hungary. Synthetic drugs, especially amphetamines, are also popular in the country. In fact, their use has spread quickly among the youth in the poorest parts of the country, particularly as designer drugs are cheaper than alcohol. They originate mostly in Belgium and the Netherlands, although imports of raw materials from Spain, Slovakia and the Netherlands may indicate domestic production. Additionally, new psychoactive substances have been trafficked from China into Hungary, usually by means of postal packages or fast parcels.","text - criminal actors":"There is a large consensus that the Hungarian economy is dominated by businessmen who have close ties to the government, including high-level officials. Through informal patron\u2013client networks, the elite not only influence major political institutions but also control lower-level institutions such as local governments and social groups. Loose criminal structures are also prominent in the country, with the latter mostly involved in human trafficking and smuggling, as well as in prostitution operations, stolen-car rings and drug trafficking. ##&& Foreign actors have a large stake in Hungary's criminal markets. Italian, Albanian and Georgian mafia-style groups are active, with the latter two controlling the cannabis trade, while the Italian Camorra and Cosa Nostra allegedly use Hungarian banks to launder criminal proceeds. As indicated, Turkish groups exert influence over the heroin market, while Turkish, Serbian, Bulgarian and Slovakian actors are engaged in human smuggling. There is no indication of the existence of domestic mafia-style groups.","text - leadership and governance":"Under its current prime minister, Hungary is often associated with growing illiberal populism and the deterioration of democracy. The ruling party has made migration a key campaign issue, tightening migration policies and drawing parallels between migration, crime and human smuggling in ways that stoke xenophobia and racism. Due to political pressures, the prosecution authority allegedly tends to turn a blind eye to state corruption or reject investigating it altogether. Allegations of corruption at the highest level persist, but Hungary's chief prosecutor has so far failed to launch investigations into high-profile figures. The ruling Fidesz party has also rejected the possibility of joining the new European Public Prosecutor's Office that aims to counter fraud and corruption. The public procurement sector sees a high risk of corruption, with companies indicating that irregular payments and bribes are commonplace in the awarding of government contracts and licenses. Many companies expect to give gifts to procurement officials in order to secure government contracts. The diversion of public funds due to favouritism by government officials is also perceived to be very common. There is an anti-corruption framework in place, although enforcement gaps exist, especially in relation to foreign entities. ##&& Hungary is party to all relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime and reportedly cooperates well with counterparts on joint anti-organized-crime investigations and operations. The country\u2019s legal framework covers all organized-crime markets, although, as mentioned, its migrant-smuggling response has been rather harsh and widely criticized.","text - criminal justice and security":"The risk of corruption within the justice system is moderate to high, as bribes and irregular payments in return for favourable judgments do occur. Political interference in judicial matters is another serious concern. The ruling elite has, for example, forced 400 judges into retirement and staffed the Constitutional Court with politically influenced judges. A separate administrative court to handle cases affecting basic human rights was established in 2018 \u2013 an act that arguably further compromises the judicial system. The minister of justice is able to appoint judges and court presidents and decides on promotions and court budgets, all without any judicial oversight. There is a law-enforcement unit dedicated to combating organized crime in Hungary as well as an Asset Recovery Office that operates within the police and, among other things, is tasked with supporting financial-crime-related investigations. The Coordination Centre Against Organized Crime (CCAOC) is mandated to analyze and evaluate new and emerging organized-crime trends. However, no information, statistics or case studies are available to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CCAOC\u2019s operational and strategic activities in fighting organized crime and related offences.","text - economic and financial environment":"Hungary has a robust anti-money-laundering framework in place that adheres to international standards. The Hungarian Financial Intelligence Unit's work and high-quality assistance to other relevant authorities bolsters efforts to detect and disrupt money-laundering operations. Despite this, authorities have failed to make full use of the tools at their disposal in money-laundering investigations. Overall, Hungary is assessed as moderately resilient to money laundering and terrorist financing. Corruption in Hungary presents a significant risk to businesses, particularly in the tax-administration sector. Unauthorized payments are sometimes used to resolve certain administrative tasks, and local corruption in the public procurement sector is derived from strong informal relations between businesses and political actors. Other obstacles facing investments include a persistent lack of transparency and predictability, as well as excessive red tape. Multinational corporations have complained of favouritism for Hungarian and government-linked firms, and the government has tried to conceal contracts and finances of some state-owned companies, stating that the release of such information would undermine competition in the marketplace. Nevertheless, the economic regulatory framework is conducive to doing business, although there is some space to close the gap with other European nations.","text - civil society and social protection":"It appears that human-trafficking victim-assistance services remain scarce and uncoordinated, although efforts were made to advance victim support. Among the new measures taken was the appointment of specialized human-trafficking investigators in all county police headquarters as well as in Budapest. Additionally, victim identification was stepped up, while legislative amendments included non-punishment provisions for child victims of human trafficking. There are shelters as well as a national telephone crisis service for assisting victims of human trafficking and domestic abuse. These are financed by the government but operated by NGOs that are actively involved in victim support. Related to this, an NGO roundtable facilitates the flow of information between authorities and NGOs on issues of human trafficking. A national anti-human-trafficking strategy for 2020\u20132023 was also adopted. Nevertheless, several problem areas remain, including victim-identification mechanisms that do not apply to victims without a legal residence and the lack of a proper framework for child-victim identification, referral and assistance. ##&& In relation to drug use, there is an anti-drug strategy which focuses on enhancing the availability and quality of treatment services. Treatment is carried out by both the state healthcare system and social services in cooperation with NGOs. In terms of prevention, an action plan to combat human trafficking was approved in 2019, but there have not been any assessments of the programme. The media landscape reportedly deteriorates year-on-year, with media ownership becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of oligarchs with ties to Hungary's prime minister. The ruling Fidesz party has asserted control over the public broadcaster, which now praises the government and targets opposition groups.

Foreign workers posted to Iceland are at particular risk of unfair labour practices, as traffickers seek to exploit the Schengen Zone and the European Economic Area to bring them to Iceland for a limited time before they need to register with local authorities. Trafficking of people, especially for the purpose of sexual exploitation and prostitution, has been linked to criminal gangs prone to violence. Foreign actors, particularly of Romanian and Albanian origin, play a role in trafficking, with some individuals being suspected of moving to Iceland for the sole purpose of facilitating this activity. ##&& Iceland is a destination country for the smuggling of individuals seeking asylum or employment, given its usefulness as a transit country for entry into the Schengen zone as well as into the US.

However, there are still small, sporadic seizures of heroin. The manufacturing, sale and distribution of drugs, particularly of cocaine, is where organized criminal activity is most evident and most profitable. The country is mostly a destination market, with cocaine originating from South America coming to Iceland via Europe. Notably, the consumption of cocaine appears to be increasing. Dealers use social media-based drug platforms in Iceland to sell cocaine, as well as discrete digital communication platforms, such as Telegram. ##&& Cannabis use is widespread in Iceland and the market is significant. It includes a division of labour between organizers, cultivators and retailers. There are no signs of the export of cannabis from Iceland, while imports account for only a small portion of the market. The country is also a destination and source country for synthetic drugs. Large quantities of amphetamine, MDMA and related chemical bases are imported, along with non-heroin opium derivatives. Reykjav\u00edk is among the largest amphetamine producers in Europe. Synthetic drugs are mainly imported via Keflavik international airport and Sey\u00f0isfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur port, although drug shipments by air are smaller than maritime consignments.

They are predominantly engaged in the drug trade and human trafficking and allegedly have members who move to Iceland specifically to organize criminal activities, including burglary and theft. Domestic criminal networks are also active and are particularly involved in the drug markets. Police reports indicate that the number of structures engaged in these criminal activities has been increasing, particularly in the areas of drugs, human trafficking, burglaries and cybercrime. The financial strength of such operators has allowed them to acquire the expertise to hide their profits in legitimate business operations. Corporate ownership, investment, real estate and the lending business are examples of the channels for illicit money movements in Iceland. Cooperation between domestic criminal networks and foreign actors is common. ##&& International biker gangs are trying to gain a foothold in Iceland. Domestic biker gangs that can be classified as mafia-style groups are increasingly active, seeking the support of foreign groups, such as the Hells Angels and Bandidos Motorcyle Club. There is no evidence that state-embedded actors play a role in criminal markets in Iceland, or that the state controls any of the markets.","text - leadership and governance":"The Icelandic government recognizes the threat posed by organized crime, but it has been criticized for not doing enough to counter it, with the international community also raising concerns about the issue. The latest annual national organized crime risk assessment identified a severe risk of organized crime in the country and called for stronger action to address it. This prompted the creation of a governmental working group, tasked with drafting an action plan to tackle organized crime action, with specific areas prioritized in the policy agenda. Although it has not been a major political priority in the past, this is likely to change as a result of the increasing focus on human trafficking and the abuse of foreign workers. Governance of the country is efficient and functional, despite deficiencies in anti-corruption initiatives, which allow nepotism to persist. While perceptions of corruption are low in comparison to many European countries, the international community has made recommendations on how to strengthen the country's anti-corruption framework. In light of this, a new law to protect whistle blowers and address issues related to conflicts of interest among officials was passed by parliament in 2020, with more issues raised by anti-corruption NGOs under consideration. ##&& Iceland is active in the promotion and practice of international cooperation to combat organized crime. The country is a signatory to all relevant treaties and conventions in this regard.

While corruption does not seem to be an issue in the prison system, drug abuse has been identified as a problem. The police force enjoys a high level of trust from the public. It is well-equipped and guided by high professional standards. Nevertheless, certain tensions between national and regional forces remain a challenge, as does understaffing and underfunding. The Icelandic National Police has an Organized Crime Division within its ranks, as well as a special unit for combating trafficking and prostitution and a cyber-crime unit. Official reports show that the capacity to counter organized crime in the country is low, despite enhanced capacity for financial analysis and intelligence gathering, as well as the existence of a special division tasked with analyzing organized crime threats.

In light of Iceland\u2019s FATF listing, the government made a high-level political commitment to address these issues. After it implemented broad reforms in this regard, Iceland was removed from the grey list in October 2020 and risk levels in these areas have been reclassified as moderate. Moreover, the country\u2019s economic and regulatory environment is conducive to doing business and meets European and Scandinavian standards. Despite companies being able to operate free of criminal interference, some economic sectors might be vulnerable to infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of money laundering and\/or human trafficking andsmuggling.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government cooperates with NGOs to support victims of human trafficking and drug users. The state funds NGOs to enable them to provide shelter to female and child victims of trafficking and municipal social services provide financial aid to trafficking victims. While no shelter is available for male victims, the latter are referred to non-specialized NGOs that provide food, health care and legal advice. In addition, an action plan has been introduced to enhance the investigative and prosecutorial capabilities of the authorities to deal with sexual offences, along with comprehensive guidelines for officers to investigate human trafficking. The government also developed a national referral mechanism for implementation in 2020. In July 2020, a special centre for victims of violence began coordinating responses to human trafficking, in line with an agreement with the government. ##&& Iceland also has facilities and services for treating people with drug addiction. In 2013, the government published an overarching policy document, valid until 2020, to address the prevention of alcohol and substances usage. Iceland has a comprehensive treatment programme for addiction, provided by state-funded NGOs. No formal witness protection programme exists although such protection is provided for in criminal procedures already in place. Iceland is known for its low crime rates as well as for its measures to prevent youth substance abuse. Conversely, the country has been criticized for a lack of awareness about human trafficking, while labour unions have called for stronger measures to protect workers, especially foreigners, in order to minimize this trafficking. The government has responded by introducing several measures to counter human trafficking. In general, CSOs in Iceland operate freely and have strong government support and cooperation. Freedom of expression and media are respected and protected. However, the media environment has worsened since 2012 as a result of the deteriorating relationship between politicians and media outlets. Still, the small but diverse media market is important to maintain government accountability and transparency.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Reykjavik","GDP (current $US million)":"24188.04","Income group":"High income","Population":"360563","Land Area (sq. km)":"103000","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"18","Freedom in the World Index":"94","Human Development Index":"0.95","Global Peace Index":"1.08","Democracy Index":"9.37","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"75","GDP per capita (current US$)":"67084","1":"3.39","1.1":"2.65","1.2":"4.13","2":"8.04"},{"Corresp":"81","ISO-3":"IRL","Country":"Ireland","ISO-2":"IE","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Western Europe","Flag file":"ie.png","1.

Trafficking victims in Ireland are subject to sexual exploitation and forced labour mainly in the areas of agriculture, fisheries, waste management, domestic work, au pair, domestic care and hospitality. There has been an increase in forced labour victims, mostly males, from Nigeria, Romania, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan. Victims from Vietnam and China, who were convicted for cannabis cultivation in Ireland, reported modern slavery-like practices, such as document retention, restriction of movement as well as wage withholding. Well-organized gangs from source countries play a key role in trafficking people to Ireland. ##&& Ireland is also a destination, as well as a transit country, for human smuggling. Data indicates that Vietnamese as well as Georgians and other nationals from Eastern Europe enter the UK irregularly via smuggling channels in Ireland. Human smuggling overlaps with human trafficking in the country. Foreign criminal networks conduct most human smuggling with the help of corrupt employees in transit hubs, such as ports or airports, who also facilitate fake passports. There appears to be coordination between foreign criminal networks and Ireland-based criminals.","text - trade":"Ireland is a destination market for illegal arms, despite the fact that regulations controlling them are some of the most restrictive in Europe. Organized criminal groups smuggle firearms from former Soviet states and other Eastern European countries. There are also concerns that recent conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East and North Africa have contributed to arms trafficking to Ireland. The smuggling involves mostly small firearms. There is an overlap between weapons trafficking and drug trafficking, as those involved in the latter often rely on illicit arms for intimidation purposes. Ballyfermot is the domestic hotspot for trade in illicit weapons.","text - environment":"Ireland is a destination and transit country for illicit wildlife, which is on the rise amid concerns that it is underreported. Recent seizures have included ivory, alligator and crocodile heads, as well as skin products, conch shells and hippo ivory. This market appears to be dominated by local criminal networks. With the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic, some reports have pointed to an increase in illegal salmon and seatrout fishing. Limited intelligence suggests that organized criminal groups are capable of using drone technology to plan criminal activities, including transporting illicit cargoes across borders. There is little evidence of a significant flora crimes market in Ireland. Illicit activities appear to be sporadic and committed by individuals, rather than by organized crime. In terms of non-renewable resource crimes, Ireland has a significant problem with the laundering of marked or washed fuel. Laundering of fuel has been a source of financing for illegal paramilitary organisations. Overall, smuggling between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is attractive for criminal groups because of price asymmetries, and is controlled by criminal networks in the Republic of Ireland. There have also been isolated cases of gold smuggling related to Irish nationals.","text - drugs":"Ireland is a source and destination country for cannabis, which is the most used drug in the country and reportedly the only drug produced there. Most cannabis resin seized in Ireland originates from Morocco, arriving by sea from the Netherlands and Belgium. Criminal networks primarily control the cannabis market, though individual production is on the rise. These networks are usually domestic, but international gangs are also present. Domestic cultivation overseen by organized criminal gangs is linked to abusive labour practices. Ireland, which has the second highest rate of opiate users in the EU, is also a destination country for heroin smuggled from EU hubs via the Balkans. The heroin market interacts with the market for some synthetic drugs, notably benzodiazepines, with some users switching between the two drugs. Most heroin in the country is sold by user-dealers. Foreign criminal gangs also facilitate the movement of heroin to Ireland. Dublin is considered the main problem area for the drug, though the trade affects other cities, small urban centres, and even rural towns and villages. ##&& The cocaine market has grown in Ireland since the late 1990s. Although the drug is sold via the dark web, most of it is imported for gangs to sell wholesale. Furthermore, there is a direct link between street shootings and the levels of cocaine being trafficked into the country. Ireland is mainly a destination country for synthetic drugs from the Netherlands and Belgium. However, there is also evidence that methamphetamine was being produced in Ireland, albeit on a small scale. The country also ranks among the highest in Europe for use of MDMA in young adults, as it is cheaper than cocaine. The ketamine market is also relatively large and was growing until the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Other synthetic drugs such as Flakka are also on the rise.","text - criminal actors":"Several mafia-style groups operate within Ireland. These groups have identifiable leaders and engage in a range of illicit activities. Since the late 1960s, organized crime networks have been influenced by family and kinship relations. As a result, feuds are prevalent, and concepts of family honour become conflated with material interests of networks. Gang feuds over territory do occur and have resulted in widespread violence. Other mafia-style groups include paramilitaries, which are involved in a large number of criminal activities. However, some have also engaged in vigilante operations against drug dealers and petty criminals. ##&& Most criminal networks are concentrated in cities and there is little evidence to suggest that they operate nationally. It appears that criminal networks are involved in the fauna market, especially rhino horn smuggling, and trade in non-renewable resources, such as fuel. There is evidence to suggest that local criminal actors work closely with foreign actors to facilitate human trafficking and human smuggling, as well as for the purposes of importing and distributing drugs and arms to the UK and mainland Europe. There appears to be no collusion between state and criminal markets currently although, there have been reports that some transport workers may be complicit in human smuggling. Ongoing concerns of links between Sinn Fein and former paramilitary members engaged in criminal activities persist.","text - leadership and governance":"The Irish government is decisively tackling organized crime, using intelligence-led investigations to disrupt and dismantle networks and prosecute those engaged in top tier organized crime groups. Laws targeting organized crime include penalties for participating in and directing a criminal organization and giving extra powers to law enforcement officers to seize assets. However, local communities in areas affected by gang fighting believe they are not getting sufficient protection from the state. Perceived levels of corruption are low in Ireland but the government has adopted policies and laws to prevent and fight it. A website has been launched by the government to increase awareness of bribery and corruption, and institutions are involved in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of corruption. ##&& Ireland is party to several international anti-corruption agreements and supports accountability for corruption in partner states. The country has also signed and ratified international organized crime treaties and cooperates with Interpol and Europol and other countries to combat human trafficking. Extradition is not allowed for the investigation of a criminal offence unless that offence carries a sentence of at least a year\u2019s imprisonment. At a domestic level, Ireland has definitional issues regarding crime, which has led to criminals involved in organized crime being prosecuted for specific crimes they have committed rather than for their broader involvement in organized crime itself. Reports have also suggested that human trafficking convictions have been low over the last few years because of legislative confusion over the definition of such trafficking. In addition, many of the measures to tackle organized crime are controversial and implemented inconsistently.","text - criminal justice and security":"Ireland has a Special Criminal Court that presides over organized crime cases with three judges and no jury, to avoid witness or jury intimidation. However, there are concerns regarding judges on this court, particularly the lack of transparency in the appointment process and the absence of a formal code of conduct. There are also concerns that sentencing is not effective, given that there has been a rise in arrests in the last year under the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, which refers to criminal association and participation in an organized crime group, but just eight convictions under the same amendment. There are also perceptions that Ireland is too focused on prison sentences as punishment for crimes. Also, Irish prisons have been criticized for overcrowding and the lack of basic sanitation. Illegal drug use within prisons is widespread and there are rising levels of inter-prisoner violence. Several gangs also operate within the prison system. ##&& In terms of law enforcement, Ireland has specialist units that specifically focus on organized crime. These units also implement initiatives and policies that support government strategies to fight crime. As an island state, Ireland is vulnerable to organized crime along its coastline and criminal groups can use the common travel area, which allows freedom of movement between the UK and Ireland, to their advantage although corruption in the customs service is believed to be low. The police forces in Northern Ireland and the Republic cooperate and share details of their joint operations. However, it is expected that smuggling will be exacerbated by Brexit.","text - economic and financial environment":"Overall, Ireland is considered to be a wealthy country with low taxes and a supportive regime for start-up businesses. Concerns have been raised by companies about the effectiveness of the legal framework, especially with regards to settling disputes and challenging regulations. Yet, the economic environment is generally considered to be effective in mitigating organized crime. Ireland is fairly resilient to money laundering and terrorist financing. However, the migration of financial institution operations from London to Dublin under Brexit is likely to place additional stress on the country\u2019s anti-money laundering capabilities. Ireland\u2019s financial institutions already reported a rise in suspected money laundering transactions in 2018. Money laundering by organized crime groups is most commonly routed through car wash businesses and restaurants, which are also vulnerable to human trafficking activities. To prevent and fight money laundering, three levels of due diligence have been established by the country\u2019s main piece of legislation \u2013 standard, enhanced and simplified.","text - civil society and social protection":"Ireland has insufficient victim protection efforts in place, which has raised concerns that the government might not be able to identify victims of trafficking. However, when such victims are assisted, they are provided with a wide range of health, legal and personal services by both government and NGOs. The Department of Justice and Equality also provides funding to NGOs to assist them in providing support to trafficking victims. There are also plans to develop an individual care plan for victims. The country has a health-led person-centred, whole-of-government response to drug use, which aims to promote health and wellbeing, minimize harms and promote rehabilitation and recovery. Multiple units have been created to tackle human trafficking, financial crime and organized crime as a whole. The government\u2019s Blue Blindfold campaign aims to sensitize the public to human trafficking trends. Prevention is also the main focus of the country\u2019s drug and alcohol strategy. Overall, numerous non-state actors work with victims of organized crime in the country, supported by expertise and assistance from international organizations. ##&& Currently, Ireland has a high level of media freedom. However, media ownership is highly concentrated and there are concerns about semi-state ownership of media groups. There have also been recent attacks on journalists and, despite the constitution guaranteeing media freedom, there are often defamation suits with extraordinarily high damages awarded by courts in Ireland.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Dublin","GDP (current $US million)":"388698.71","Income group":"High income","Population":"4934040","Land Area (sq. km)":"70280","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"22.2","Freedom in the World Index":"97","Human Development Index":"0.96","Global Peace Index":"1.38","Democracy Index":"9.05","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"72","GDP per capita (current US$)":"78779","1":"4.90","1.1":"4.55","1.2":"5.25","2":"7.38"},{"Corresp":"83","ISO-3":"ITA","Country":"Italy","ISO-2":"IT","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Southern Europe","Flag file":"it.png","1.

While victims do include Italian nationals, the vast majority of trafficked individuals in Italy are foreign nationals, primarily for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced labour and labour exploitation. The majority of sex-trafficking victims in Italy originate from Nigeria, although in recent years the number of Nigerian victims of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation has declined. One of the most common methods for recruiting victims is through migrant and asylum-seeker reception centres, where potential victims are lured away by traffickers under false promises of either legitimate employment or the provision of gifts and excursions. Forced prostitution is controlled for the most part by Nigerian criminal networks known as \u2018cults\u2019, as the traditional Italian mafia groups choose to avoid participating in the more visible forms of organized crime, such as human trafficking. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on those involved in sex work. Traffickers abandoned women and children who were unable to leave their homes or work and unable to access state support, leaving them in dire economic difficulty. Furthermore, labour exploitation in the agricultural sector is particularly pervasive in southern Italy while, in the north, exploitation occurs predominantly in the construction, domestic-work and hospitality sectors. ##&& Italy is also a significant transit and destination country in the transnational human-smuggling market as a key component of the central Mediterranean migrant route. The overwhelming majority of migrants smuggled into southern Italian ports, on the island of Lampedusa in particular, depart from the North African coast \u2013 mainly Libya \u2013 and originate from countries stretching from West Africa through North Africa to the Horn of Africa. However, there are also a considerable number of smuggled individuals originating from the Middle East and Southern Asia. Overall, the phenomenon of migrant smuggling has drastically decreased since the height of the refugee crisis between 2014 and 2016.","text - trade":"Although arms trafficking is not the most profitable illicit trade for Italian organized criminal groups, the market\u2019s significance and impact have been increasing over the past decades, with the \u2019Ndrangheta, the Sacra Corona Unita and the Albanian mafia playing key roles in the illicit arms trade in Italy. The criminal market for arms trafficking is highly transnational and the connections between Italian mafia groups and criminal groups in the Balkans are strong, with Italy playing a major role as a transit country on the Balkan arms trafficking route to Europe. Italian organized criminal groups have relied on partnerships with local criminal groups, trading drugs and firearms in return for allowing these other organizations to conduct their human-smuggling operations on Italian coasts. A considerable share of illicit firearms enters Italian territory overland, hidden in cars, vans and trucks, through northern Italy, especially via the eastern borders. Maritime routes have been used as a means of transport to evade customs controls, and large cargo ships have been replaced by small speedboats and sealed torpedoes towed by speedboats, which are left near the coast and later retrieved by the recipient with little risk.","text - environment":"The most pervasive environmental criminal market in Italy is that of non-renewable-resource crimes, with so-called \u2018ecomafias\u2019 increasing in prominence in recent times. This illicit market disproportionately targets the region of Campania, where organized criminal groups are active in soil and mining sectors to meet the demand of the country\u2019s construction industry. There is also, albeit to a lesser extent, illegal activity pertaining to the importation of gold that involves criminal groups from Latin America, the illicit oil trade driven primarily by Libyan militias, and precious stones sourced illegally from the African continent. ##&& The flora and fauna crimes markets are far less pervasive in Italy, exerting only moderate influences on the state and wider society. While Italy is among the world\u2019s largest importers of forest products, including from countries with substantial illicit timber industries, there is little involvement of organized criminality in the sector. Furthermore, the pervasiveness of legality risks in the timber supply chain is decreasing, largely as a result of a strengthened import and export control regime. With regard to fauna crimes, although the poaching of birds and other protected species is common in Italy, particularly of songbirds, as with flora crimes, it is not a consolidated criminal market in which highly organized criminal groups are involved. Rather, it is carried out on an ad hoc basis either as ingredients for traditional dishes or by opportunistic criminal entrepreneurs to sell abroad as pets. A similar dynamic can be witnessed with regard to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing practices, particularly in southern Italy.","text - drugs":"Cocaine is by far the most profitable illicit drug market in Italy. The country plays a hugely significant role in the transnational cocaine trade, which is largely dominated by the \u2019Ndrangheta, the powerful mafia group with strong ties to drug trafficking organizations in Latin America, primarily Colombia, as well as other countries in Europe, such as Albania. Cargo and container ships are the principal means of transporting cocaine to Italy, primarily from Colombia, but also from other countries in Latin America and Europe, including the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain. One of the most significant impacts of the cocaine trade in Italy is the way in which it has transformed the \u2019Ndrangheta into one of, if not the, most powerful criminal organizations in the world. Nevertheless, cocaine is far from the only illicit drug market exerting a significant influence in the country, with heroin playing an important role in Italy\u2019s criminal landscape. Major Italian cities such as Milan, Naples and Rome are hotbeds for heroin that enters the country primarily from Afghanistan via other Asian countries and the Balkan region. However, despite a slight uptick in domestic heroin use recently, consumption levels remain fairly low and much of the heroin entering Italy moves on toward other European countries. ##&& Cannabis is the most seized drug in Italy, with heavy involvement from foreign criminal groups. Hashish trafficked to Italy originates primarily from Morocco, whereas marijuana enters the country predominantly via the eastern coast on the Adriatic Sea from Albania and Greece. The domestic mafia groups involved in the cannabis trade are chiefly those from the Puglia region, including the Societ\u00e0 Foggiana and another group active around the Gargano sub-region of the country. Finally, Italy is also a destination country in the synthetic drug trade, which has grown significantly in the past decade. The main synthetic drugs found in Italy are amphetamines, methamphetamines, Ecstasy-type substances and, more recently, Fentanyl. The vast majority of synthetic drugs trafficked to Italy are produced in Northern Europe, predominantly Belgium and the Netherlands. However, due in large part to low profit margins, the traditional Italian mafia groups show far less interest in the synthetic drug market and, as such, the market is substantially less consolidated and sophisticated than other drug markets in the country.","text - criminal actors":"Mafia-style groups are by far the most prevalent type of criminal actor in Italy, which is the birthplace of the original mafia groups. The most powerful mafia group in Italy is the Calabria-based \u2019Ndrangheta, one of the most potent and influential organized criminal groups in the world. Other powerful mafia groups in Italy are the Cosa Nostra in Sicily and the Camorra, a Campania-based mafia, as well as less powerful groups such as the Sacra Corona Unita and Societ\u00e0 Foggiana, both based in the region of Apulia, and the Spada and Casamonica clans from Rome. All mafia groups in Italy have a strong degree of territorial control in their regions of origin, albeit to differing extents. Extortion practices are a fundamental element in mafia groups\u2019 territorial control, in particular for the Cosa Nostra, who extort so-called \u2018pizzo\u2019 (protection money) from local businesses across Sicily. While the traditional mafia groups in Italy have extensive access to weapons, their employment of violence has declined in recent decades as the groups strive to remain under the radar of law-enforcement and state authorities. The decline in the use of violence is also a sign of the influence these groups wield, such that the mere threat of violence is enough to bend people to their will. ##&& All major mafia groups in the country are involved in a significant number of different criminal markets, primarily the transnational drug trade, but also counterfeit goods, arms trafficking and illegal waste disposal, as well as being deeply entrenched in the legal economy through their infiltration into the construction, food-distribution, agri-food, healthcare and renewable-energy sectors, among others. As a result of the strengthening of anti-mafia measures in Italy, mafia groups have turned to other European countries to launder their illicit proceeds, and none more so than the \u2019Ndrangheta, the group most integrated into financial systems across Europe. Finally, mafia groups in Italy are heavily entrenched within the democratic and political system in the country and have been from the very beginning of their existence. Mutually beneficial agreements between mafiosi and local politicians are regularly struck, and the infiltration of criminal actors within local political structures is widespread, as evidenced by the number of local administrations dissolved every year as a result of mafia infiltration. ##&& Because of the longevity and dominance of the traditional mafia organizations in Italy, the presence of loose criminal networks in the country is extremely limited. However, as the country where the mafia was born, Italy is now an import country of mafia groups almost as much as it is an exporter. There are a significant number of different foreign organized criminal groups now operating across Italy, the most prominent of which are the Albanian mafia and the Nigerian mafia, as well as organized criminal groups from other countries in Southern and South-eastern Europe, Russia, China and South America. The relationship between domestic and foreign organized criminal groups in Italy can be characterized as \u2018tolerance and utilitarian collaboration\u2019, with both parties in search of an economic advantage that would otherwise be hindered by violent conflict between groups. Foreign organized criminal groups do not control any criminal markets in Italy and their operations in the country are largely opportunistic and almost always sanctioned by the traditional Italian mafia groups. ##&& While state actors generally do not control criminal markets of any kind in Italy, the involvement of state-embedded actors within illicit economies is a widely recognized feature of the Italian organized-crime landscape. Cases of bribery and vote-buying by local politicians are common and collusion with criminal groups reaches the highest levels of the state. Corruption related to public procurement processes is widespread within the state apparatus, which allows criminal actors to benefit from lucrative public contracts to the detriment of public finances. Furthermore, collusion between law-enforcement officials and criminal actors, as well as the direct involvement of the former in criminal activity, is prominent in Italy.","text - leadership and governance":"Ever since the Tangentopoli scandal and the Mani Pulite judicial investigation into widespread political corruption and collusion with mafia organizations in the 1990s, the Italian government, across the number of different administrations in power, has always communicated a very strong position against the mafia and organized crime more generally. Italian political leaders consistently prioritize the fight against the mafia and have been successful in much of the work they have done in past years. However, the power of mafia groups in Italy is such that most government responses to the phenomenon of organized crime do not have the long-term consequences required to permanently stem mafia activity in the country. While government rhetoric is for the most part matched by government action, the high levels of embeddedness of criminal actors within the state apparatus \u2013particularly at the local level \u2013 demonstrate the difficulties faced in eliminating the mafia. Anti-corruption legislation has developed significantly in the past decade, but criminal infiltration in the public procurement process remains pervasive. ##&& On the international stage, not only are the frameworks for cooperation extremely robust, but Italy is actively engaged in cooperation with the international community, including through cross-border judicial and law-enforcement cooperation. Domestically, Italy\u2019s legislative framework is extremely attuned to the pervasiveness of mafia organizations and organized criminal activity more broadly in the country. The inclusion of a definition of \u2018mafia\u2019 as a specific type of organized crime is fundamental in the fight against the phenomenon, and to this day, Italy is one of the only countries in the world to explicitly define mafia-type crimes in its domestic legislation. Nevertheless, although the Italian legal framework is seen as a model for countries around the world, sections of the country\u2019s legislation are obsolete and need updating to take into account developments in organized crime in recent years.","text - criminal justice and security":"The central position of Italy in the Mediterranean region makes Italian ports of crucial importance for both licit and illicit trade. Although Italy has a fairly competent infrastructure in place to monitor its borders for illicit cross-border activities, securing the borders remains a significant challenge. Corrupt practices among border-control agencies do exist but are not widespread, and the Ministry of the Interior has recently published a three-year plan for the prevention of corruption and for transparency in the administration of the ministry, including border patrol. However, the extent of criminal governance exerted within certain regions, namely Calabria, in which criminal actors control swathes of the population, political structures and businesses, is an illustration of the systemic failure on the part of the central government to ensure control over the entire territory. ##&& Italy\u2019s principal anti-mafia law enforcement unit, the Direzione Investigativa Antimafia, has been hugely successful in terms of asset seizures, cash confiscation and arrests. The Guardia di Finanza, Italy\u2019s financial crime investigative unit, and the Raggruppamento Operativo Speciale, the special operations group of the Carabinieri, also play a significant role in the fight against organized crime. However, the dismantling of an entire department of the Carabinieri in July 2020 following the arrest 10 officers on suspicion of a whole host of crimes, from drug dealing and extortion to abuse of power and even torture, is symbolic of the corruption and criminality that is not uncommon within Italy\u2019s law enforcement agencies. ##&& Numerous institutions within the judicial system in Italy are tasked with combating organized crime, the most prominent being the National Anti-Mafia and Anti-Terrorism Directorate. The numerous convictions for organized-crime- and mafia-related crimes demonstrate that courts are able to effectively pass judgments against organized crime defendants. The most serious offenders of mafia-type offences are subjected to a special detention system known as the \u201841-bis prison regime\u2019. The regime places severe restrictions on serious mafia offenders\u2019 communication with the outside world. However, the considerable power of mafia individuals, when combined with corrupt practices, is such that mafia groups (and high-level leaders in particular) are known to be able to direct operations and give orders to associates from within their prison cells. Furthermore, the smuggling of contraband, including communication technologies that facilitate the mafiosi\u2019s communication with associates on the outside, is common in many prisons across the country. However, the most pressing issue pertaining to the detention system in Italy is overcrowding.","text - economic and financial environment":"In central and southern Italy in particular, organized criminal groups extort local businesses, using intimidation and sometimes violence. While the pizzo traditionally took the form of a forced protection tax, many mafia groups have evolved their modus operandi to extort businesses by imposing on them a particular brand or supplier of goods that is controlled by the criminal actors themselves. Mafia involvement in a litany of economic sectors is systematic throughout Italy, including not only the traditional sectors such as construction and waste management but also the food sector at almost every stage of the supply chain. The COVID-19 pandemic has created vast opportunities for Italian mafia groups to further infiltrate the formal economy. With thousands of businesses suffering the economic toll of the coronavirus and the country\u2019s associated lockdown measures, criminal actors seek to exploit their vulnerability either by offering them loans \u2013 the interest rates on which will subsequently be raised to extortionate levels \u2013 or by offering business owners the chance to cut their losses and allow criminal actors to take over their business completely, which is then used as a vehicle for money laundering. ##&& One of the key factors in the economic strength of Italian mafia groups is their ability to launder their illicit proceeds through the formal economy, both domestically and abroad. Indeed, criminal actors make more use of the formal economy than of financial institutions to launder their money. This is partly driven by the Italian government\u2019s strengthening of the legal and institutional anti-money laundering framework. Recent years have seen the introduction of several new measures, including new controls for banks and financial intermediaries when dealing with clients from high-risk countries, improvements with regard to suspicious transaction reporting and developments in electronic-invoicing regulations.","text - civil society and social protection":"Broadly speaking, the ensemble of Italy\u2019s civil-society and social-protection measures is moderately effective. Witness protection legislation is in force in the country and was improved in 2018. The government has also implemented a series of laws pertaining to victim protection during trials, and compensation for victims of human trafficking. Non-state actors, however, are the primary providers of most support services to victims of various forms of organized crime, and the instrumentalization of migration by certain segments of the political class has impeded the effective roll-out of support services. In regard to support for people who use drugs, naloxone has been distributed to people who use drugs since the 1990s, and Italy\u2019s overdose-prevention strategy, which also includes opioid-substitution therapy, is modelled on a harm-reduction framework. Organized-crime-prevention strategies in Italy are heavily focused on the seizure and confiscation of assets destined to be used by criminal organizations in order to prevent them from committing other organized-crime-related crimes and to deprive them of the resources that enable them to conduct their illicit activities. ##&& Civil society and other non-state actors play a crucial role in the fight against organized crime in Italy, beyond what the judicial, legislative and investigative forces are able to achieve. The government is very open to fostering and promoting a strong and independent civil society, and state funds have been allocated to boost the work of non-state actors against organized crime. However, press freedom is severely threatened \u2013 not by state actors but by criminal actors operating in the country. In recent years, reports of intimidation and attacks against journalists covering organized crime have been on the rise, with almost two dozen journalists in Italy under permanent police protection.","Number of pages":"6","Capital":"Rome","GDP (current $US million)":"2003576.15","Income group":"High income","Population":"60302093","Land Area (sq. km)":"302070","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"45.2","Freedom in the World Index":"90","Human Development Index":"0.89","Global Peace Index":"1.69","Democracy Index":"7.74","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"53","GDP per capita (current US$)":"33226","1":"5.82","1.1":"5.25","1.2":"6.38","2":"6.29"},{"Corresp":"95","ISO-3":"LVA","Country":"Latvia","ISO-2":"LV","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Northern Europe","Flag file":"lv.png","1.

Women are trafficked both domestically and to other parts of Europe, where they are commonly recruited for brokered marriages in Western Europe. Most victims are underaged and are vulnerable to sex trafficking, domestic servitude and forced labour. Children living in state orphanages are also vulnerable to sexual exploitation. There is evidence that traffickers are increasingly targeting people with developmental and physical disabilities or addictions, using psychological and emotional violence rather than physical force. Organized crime groups are known to facilitate labour trafficking to Germany and Ukraine. ##&& Latvia's shared borders with Belarus, Estonia, Lithuania and Russia, as well as a maritime border with Sweden makes it an attractive transit country for regional organized crime groups looking to carry out smuggling activities between Asia and Europe. Latvia mainly functions as a transit country for smuggled persons intending to reach the Scandinavian countries. Riga, Latvia\u2019s capital, has been identified as a smuggling hub. Overall, there has been a decrease in the number of persons detained for irregular crossings in recent years, which the State Border Guard attributes to a more intensive border surveillance on the Russian side and the construction of border zone infrastructure. Human smuggling in Latvia is largely facilitated by local actors living in border communities who are responsible for the transportation of migrants. Generally, actors involved in human smuggling utilize the internet and other online social networks for the recruitment of victims, logistics, exploitation of victims, and as a platform for advertising prostitution. However, levels of human smuggling have fallen sharply in the wake of stricter border controls put in place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","text - trade":"The arms trade in Latvia is relatively small, but the country's location makes it a potential transit hub for stolen weapons. The trafficking of reactivated firearms and modified gas pistols abroad is increasing, with most criminal offences being associated with the illegal excavation and adaptation of these weapons. Authorities have reported an intraregional trafficking route that runs from the Netherlands and transits through Lithuania to Latvia. There has also been evidence of a significant degree of smuggling between Latvia and Russia. In 2019, in the Latvian city of Rezekne was exposed as a location for the illicit manufacturing of weapons.","text - environment":"There is no established or well-developed criminal market for flora in Latvia. However, there is speculation that some illegal logging is involved in the country\u2019s export of softwood sawn timber birch plywood, oriented strand board and pellets, although evidence is minimal. While fauna crimes are not widespread, there is some evidence that the country is both a source and destination for exotic and endangered animals. Latvia also has been listed among the top origin countries in Europe for the illegal export of wildlife to Mexico. Moreover, there are reports that unregistered dogs and cats are also being illegally imported into Latvia from Belarus and Ukraine. As for non-renewable resource crimes, there is minimal evidence to suggest there is a criminal market for this in Latvia. Nevertheless, Latvian banking institution have allegedly been used in the past to channel bribes related to a gold mining concession abroad. Sporadic instances of smuggling of gold and other precious metals across Latvian borders have also been recorded.","text - drugs":"Due to its geographical location, Latvia is mainly a transit country for a heroin market dominated by Russian organized crime groups. While heroin usage is uncommon among the general population and has decreased annually, the drug remains the second most popular in the country. Although instances of local production have been reported, narcotics trafficking likely occurs primarily along the Latvian-Russian border and on ferry lines from Western Europe to Latvia. The internet, cryptocurrencies, postal services and courier services all facilitate the transfer and sale of heroin. Moreover, the drug is typically smuggled among legal goods. Heroin use in the country has largely been replaced by its cheaper and stronger synthetic alternative, Carfentanil. In general, synthetic drugs in Latvia are mainly imported from European countries but are also produced in smaller quantities in Latvia, where they are consumed mostly by young people. Domestic production of synthetic drugs has been increasing, and there is evidence of the existence of multiple clandestine laboratories within the country. There is also evidence that raw materials used to produce synthetic drugs are transported from Latvia to Russia and Belarus. ##&& ##&& Latvia is also a transit and source country for cannabis, which is also the most commonly used illicit drug domestically. Herbal cannabis from the Netherlands, the UK and Germany, and cannabis resin from Morocco arrives in Latvia, usually bound for Russia. Marijuana cultivation is carried out both indoors and outdoors in Latvia, often in uninhabited spaces. While the police have reported a growing number of cultivation sites over the past decade, the number of cannabis plants confiscated has declined considerably. Nevertheless, the country continues to have high rates of marijuana distribution. Drug use is popular among young adults between the ages of 15 and 34 years. Although the use of cocaine is relatively uncommon among the general population in Latvia, evidence suggests that cocaine smuggling is increasing. Unlike other drugs, cocaine is trafficked from west to east and in Latvia, eastern Baltic nationals have been observed working as couriers for cocaine trafficking. There have also been cases of Latvians being involved in trafficking from Latin America to Western Europe. As with heroin, cocaine is typically smuggled among legal goods.","text - criminal actors":"Small criminal groups of about two to five people operate in Latvia, but these loose networks are not pervasive. These groups are dynamic, especially since they are constantly being broken up by law enforcement officers. Mafia-style groups also operate in the country and engage in illicit drug trafficking, the illegal movement of excisable goods, various types of theft ranging from burglaries and car theft, fraud, armed robbery, as well as money laundering. It is believed that there is a legitimate head of organized criminality in Latvia who has close relationships with Russian organized criminal groups and similar groups in Europe, especially in Germany. There are an estimated 80 organized crime groups in Latvia. Numerous outlawed motorcycle gangs are also active in the country, with close connections to Russian organized crime gangs. ##&& Foreign criminal structures, however, are the criminal entities that dominate Latvia's organized crime landscape. Several organized crime groups have grown along ethnic lines, with most having Latvian citizenship. The most predominant foreign mafia-style groups operating within Latvia are Russian. They are involved in trafficking of migrants, illicit trade in tobacco products, drug trafficking, theft and money laundering. A key feature of Russian groups is their low level of interaction with locals, partially due to language and cultural barriers. Meanwhile, crimes involving public officials are not typical within Latvia. However, between 2018 and 2020, criminal proceedings have been instituted against several members of parliament for abuses of power. However, in general, the involvement of public officials in organized crime is occasional and exceptional.","text - leadership and governance":"Abuse of power is somewhat of an issue in Latvia and public levels of trust in the government and parliament are low. Several institutions such as law enforcement and border officials the judiciary, tax authorities and the privatization office have all been accused of corrupt practices. There is a risk of corruption for businesses dealing with the judiciary, and a moderate risk when dealing with the various administrations. While the risk of corruption when dealing with the police is low, they are perceived to be fairly unreliable in protecting citizens from crime and promoting the rule of law. Although the Latvian government made an effort to fight corruption and money laundering, the country have not been fully successful in tackling corrupt politicians because of the inability of institutions to establish and strengthen their roles and authority. There also is a notable lack of transparency about the functioning of state companies and public procurement processes. However, despite these issues, Latvia has tried to reduce the extent of organized crime in the country and the broader region. The government has implemented a special plan for preventing and combating organized crime and it is reportedly trying to improve transparency and accountability, including in the fight against organized crime. ##&& Latvia's international cooperation in the field of combating organized crime is active and purposeful. It cooperates with several international organizations and has ratified international conventions in this regard. Latvia is also part of other forms of international cooperation, including extradition and mutual legal assistance. It also collaborates with INTERPOL, Europol and other police services, and has collaborated with foreign law enforcement agencies on drug trafficking cases. Latvia is part of a regional task force that aims to enhance international cooperation in curbing human trafficking and sharing information in the Baltic Sea Region. At home, Latvia has implemented several policies to combat transnational organized crimes. Its criminal code also prohibits all forms of human trafficking, human smuggling, money laundering, arms crime, drug crimes as well as fauna and flora crimes. Latvian law also prohibits illegal organ harvesting and activities related to bribery in both the private and public sector.","text - criminal justice and security":"While the Latvian justice system is assessed as being efficient, it has been criticized for issues related to judicial independence and for not meeting the high expectations of Latvian society regarding judicial power. The independence of the judiciary has been strengthened by its growing role in the selection of candidates for the positions of judge and prosecutor general, as well as in the appointment of court presidents. However, problems remain with the prosecution of corruption cases and their adjudication in the courts, where proceedings are often lengthy. Furthermore, the overloaded justice system has led to a delay in investigations, with almost half of all criminal cases being over five years old. Notable gaps include training for judges, prosecutors and law enforcement officers, particularly in the area of human trafficking , including working with victims, evidence collection and understanding psychological intimidation. Law enforcement is perceived to be fairly unreliable in protecting citizens from crime and upholding the rule of law. Nevertheless, Latvia is assessed as having a sufficiently resilient system that allows authorities to fight organized crime. The adequate coordination of anti-organized crime activities of law enforcement agencies ensured by a specialized body has a large role to play in that. ##&& With regard to territorial integrity, Latvia is part of the Schengen Agreement and thus has no permanent and physical border controls with Lithuania and Estonia or a maritime border with Sweden. However, the border with Russia is well protected and Latvia completed the construction of a fence along the border in 2019. There are plans for a similar fence to be built on the border with Belarus.","text - economic and financial environment":"Although criminal groups in Latvia are active in a number of economic sectors and implicated in money laundering, they do not exert control over any of them. Moreover, there is no indication that criminals seriously affect the ease of doing business in the country. Thus, the economy is assessed to be among the freest in the world. Money laundering, as reported, is a problem, with Latvian banks often used to legalize foreign proceeds. Riga is considered to be a money-laundering hub but combatting this crime is a national priority and some progress in identifying and addressing key vulnerabilities has been made.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Latvian government is increasing efforts to implement victim support services within the country. Victims are eligible for a state-funded victim assistance programme, which offers medical and psychological assistance, legal representation, housing and reintegration services. Written procedures for identifying victims exist for law enforcement, immigration and social services . However, the government's human trafficking working group reports that most government agencies lack either the practical experience or willingness to carry out these mandates. Additionally, identifying child victims who have been trafficked for sexual exploitation remains a challenge domestically. There are also concerns about Latvia's legal prostitution industry, where law enforcement is focused on fines for individuals who violate prostitution regulations or other criminal statutes rather than on identifying potential trafficking victims. ##&& In terms of prevention, Latvia's efforts differ across the spectrum depending on the organized crime markets, but the government is focused on combatting human trafficking and migrant smuggling. Two human trafficking task forces have been established at the municipal. The government has also amended labour regulations to include the requirement of licensed placement agencies to ensure a minimum wage for workers hired for employment outside Latvia. NGOs run most of the government-funded victim assistance programmes offering medical and psychological assistance, legal representation, housing and reintegration services for victims of human trafficking. Overall, Latvia is considered to have a free press. However, there are a growing number of verbal attacks against journalists on social media.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Riga","GDP (current $US million)":"34102.91","Income group":"High income","Population":"1913822","Land Area (sq. km)":"64570","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"44","Freedom in the World Index":"89","Human Development Index":"0.87","Global Peace Index":"1.70","Democracy Index":"7.24","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"57","GDP per capita (current US$)":"17819","1":"3.52","1.1":"3.65","1.2":"3.38","2":"7.42"},{"Corresp":"100","ISO-3":"LIE","Country":"Liechtenstein","ISO-2":"LI","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Western Europe","Flag file":"li.png","1.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the number of people vulnerable to modern slavery and human trafficking. Due to an effective state strategy against trafficking and smuggling, there is no evidence to suggest a market for human smuggling in Liechtenstein. Its size and location are a natural barrier to criminal activity and migration predominantly occurs through legal channels.","text - trade":"There is no evidence of an active arms trafficking market in Liechtenstein, and the country has regulations to control the import, export and transit of arms.","text - environment":"There is no evidence of an established illicit flora market in Liechtenstein, and few cases have been reported. However, in 2018, Nordsudtimber, a European company based in Liechtenstein, was found to have been involved in a large-scale illegal timber harvesting in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is thought to have laundered its illicit profits through Liechtenstein\u2019s financial institutions. Although there is no evidence of illegal fauna trading into or out of Liechtenstein, there have been incidents of poaching in the country\u2019s forests. But these have been minimal and carried out by individuals rather than criminal organizations. As Liechtenstein has very few natural resources, non-renewable resource crime is not an issue in the country.","text - drugs":"Cannabis is the most consumed drug in Liechtenstein and its popularity is highest among youths and students, with its overall use and availability being higher than the EU average. Most cannabis convictions are for personal consumption, with only a cases relating to trafficking. Online purchases are becoming the most common way to purchase the drug and the market is being fuelled by domestic demand. While there is no well-established marked for cocaine, it is growing, and the price of a gram has dropped by two thirds over the past two years. Local demand for cocaine is rising, especially among the youth and foreign students, and online purchases are becoming more commonplace. While the drug is not produced in Liechtenstein, the primary concern with this market is its potential for using Liechtenstein\u2019s offshore financial services sector to launder drug money. ##&& There is no well-established criminal market for heroin in Liechtenstein. It is not commonly consumed locally nor traded internationally. While the country\u2019s geostrategic position on transit routes into Europe may leave it vulnerable to infiltration by criminal organisations, the heroin market at present is negligible. The market for synthetic drugs is not well-established and their use is not widespread, while the perceived availability of these drugs is similar to European averages.","text - criminal actors":"Violence levels have reached a record low in recent years, and there is no evidence of mafia-style groups or criminal networks operating in Liechtenstein. Likewise, there is no evidence to suggest state-embedded actors facilitate or engage in crime. The democratic process is free from any external and criminal influence. Insofar as organized criminal actors exist in the microstate, they are usual foreign criminal actors. Due to its proximity to Austria and Switzerland, there are concerns that the Italian mafia-style syndicate \u2018Ndrangheta could move into Liechtenstein. The capital, Vaduz, where the finance and banking system is concentrated, may be vulnerable to money laundering driven by foreign criminal actors.","text - leadership and governance":"Although organized crime is not a significant issue in Liechtenstein, the government has taken a strong stand against it, given that its geographic location in the heart of Europe and its reputation as a tax haven, could make it attractive to foreign criminal actors. Most illicit activity is international, rather than domestic, and requires intensive and effective international law enforcement cooperation. In this regard, the government has signed a cooperation agreement with Europol. Liechtenstein is largely free of corruption at all levels of the state and economy. The government publishes budgets, procurement contracts and other relevant information. Despite this, however, the country's legal framework for providing access to information has been assessed as being extremely poor. Through its membership of various Anti-Money Laundering, Combating the Financing of Terrorism and anti-corruption groups, Liechtenstein holds itself accountable and ensures compliance with international regulatory frameworks. The country has many preventative and educational measures to combat corruption, which appear to be effective, and it has made large strides in improving transparency and banking reform. ##&& Liechtenstein actively participates in international cooperation efforts with the UN and Europol against organized crime and is committed to furthering international justice and law. It is involved in intelligence sharing treaties and extradition agreements and participates internationally in efforts to prevent crime. The country not only has laws in place to prosecute organized crime but also to prevent membership of criminal networks. Legislation to combat organized crime has an appropriate focus on money-laundering, given that it is a country that attracts legal and illegal business from all over the world.","text - criminal justice and security":"Liechtenstein\u2019s judicial system is efficient and transparent, and courts can effectively investigate and prosecute criminal cases. It has only one prison, which is well equipped and meets international standards. However, due to the lack of capacity, individuals with sentences of more than two years carry out their terms in Austrian prisons. ##&& Despite its potentially strategic position in Europe for criminal networks, Liechtenstein has robust territorial integrity. The strong cooperation in border control it has with Austria and Switzerland make its borders resilient. However, as part of the Schengen area, cross-border illicit activity is more difficult to detect due to the extent of movement across its borders. The Liechtenstein National Police is the country\u2019s single police force and has many law enforcement units specifically focused on corruption and money laundering. Notably, INTERPOL has a National Central Bureau in Vaduz, which, due to the high number of international criminal cases, gives it a key role in safeguarding national and regional security. Law enforcement agencies actively cooperate with international intelligence-sharing mechanisms.","text - economic and financial environment":"As Liechtenstein is a leading offshore tax haven and traditionally has tight bank secrecy laws, money laundering is a major concern for the government, which has made efforts to increase banking transparency. The country has a special analytics unit to detect money laundering, in addition to its participation in European anti-money laundering measures. The close relationships between these authorities mean effective management of the problems, although financial secrecy does have an impact on the exchange of information. Liechtenstein faced international pressure to improve its banking transparency in the past and has since enacted anti-money laundering measures focused on banks, investment firms and businesses such as casinos and insurance companies. It has also signed tax information exchange agreements with countries such as the US. ##&& Alongside its low tax rates, Liechtenstein is an easy place to establish new businesses and its economy attracts a lot of business and investment. The business environment offers opportunities for legitimate businesses to expand as economic regulations are not restrictive. Although this does also attract unwanted interest from criminals, Liechtenstein\u2019s financial controls help to offset this. The government has a balancing act in lightening the settlement process for financial services while also intensifying the state's security controls.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government of Liechtenstein has legislation and training mechanisms in place to provide effective treatment to victims of all types of crime, with a particular emphasis on sex-related crimes. The country has created a public-private sector initiative \u2013 the Financial Sector Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking - as it believes the financial sector can help to end these practices by excluding the proceeds of trafficking from the financial system. The Criminal Procedural Code enshrines victim and witness protection, and the government is very engaged in programmes to support drug users. Liechtenstein believes strongly in prevention and has many strategies in place to this end, including early education campaigns and drug-use prevention programmes. The government also created a Working Group for the Prevention of Corruption and the PROTEGE Working Group, which educate and train public officials and local authorities. Furthermore, any private person can report corruption directly to the Anti-Corruption Police Unit via a dedicated hotline. All of these measures have been evaluated as being effective. ##&& Because of the lack of organized crime groups in Liechtenstein, and the government\u2019s success in prevention, civil society groups focus more on sport and culture than crime prevention. In the media environment, free speech is protected and there is no evidence of attacks on journalists by the state or criminal groups.

Human trafficking in Lithuania predominantly takes the form of sexual and labour exploitation, forced acts of criminality and forced marriage. Victims typically originate from poor regions of the country, where traffickers target low-income individuals with minimal foreign language skills and entice them with high salaries that would improve their economic situation. Women from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine have also been trafficked into Western Europe through Lithuania. The main destination markets for Lithuanian trafficking victims can be found in the UK, Spain and Germany, where recent trends indicate an uptick in the number of male victims sourced for the purposes of forced labour. There is also evidence of police officers or border guards being bribed to facilitate human trafficking activities. ##&& Lithuania is primarily a transit country for migrants headed to Western Europe. However, the overall scale of human smuggling is small and holds little influence over Lithuanian society. Migrants most frequently enter the country from Belarus or Latvia, and may traverse Afghanistan, Russia, Belarus, Lithuania, Poland or Latvia to reach their destination. These routes are reportedly organized and maintained by criminal networks with ties to Russia. There has also been some evidence of conflict caused by human smuggling, such as border guards being shot at and vehicles set on fire by human smuggling rings. However in recent years, there has been a decrease in border violations, in part due to technological advancement of border monitoring systems.","text - trade":"Prior to 2011, the registration of alarm weapons was not mandatory in Lithuania. During this time, alarm pistols gained popularity among criminal actors who sought to convert them to live-firing weapons, which saturated European markets with Lithuanian-manufactured converted firearms. While stringent regulation is now in place, the pre-legislation technical knowledge and experience of conversion are still available, and large quantities of alarm pistols continue to serve as a source of illicit firearms. Old firearms, such as those from the two world wars, are also quite common in Lithuania and are cheaper to buy on the illicit market. According to Lithuanian law enforcement officials, firearms are known to be sold via the internet and delivered courier services, but no cases of online firearms trafficking via the dark web have thus far been identified in the country. Additionally, most cases of illicit firearms trafficking involved perpetrators who belonged to organized crime groups.","text - environment":"While the criminal market for flora is is extremely small in Lithuania, the illegal logging of timber remains a concern. Generally, more illegal logging cases are recorded in private forests than in state-owned woodlands. Lithuania is a source and transit country in the illegal wildlife trade. Albeit limited in size and scope, there have been recorded cases of wildlife crimes, which encompass illegal hunting and fishing, as well as the use of Lithuania as a transit country for the smuggling of white rhino horns and brown bears. The poaching of wolves raises significant concerns over the extent of wildlife crimes in Lithuania. Despite numerous media publications on the apprehension of poachers, very few criminal cases related to illegal hunting or fishing are initiated in Lithuania annually. Nevertheless, the involvement of organized crime in this criminal market is likely limited to using the country as a transit point. With regards to non-renewable resource crimes, Lithuania serves as a destination and transit country for the illicit trade of amber, which is tied to foreign criminal groups. The precious stone is usually smuggled by individuals or small groups that shuttle the stone in and out of the country. Besides amber, Lithuania has reported numerous cases involving illegal fuel. Criminal groups reportedly mix diesel fuel with other substances to create another oil that is then sold abroad, free from excise duties. The illicit fuel is commonly purchased by Latvians and smuggled by Russian and Belarusian crime groups. Evidence suggests that the market for illegal fuel will continue to expand but is of now of not significant in scope and scale.","text - drugs":"Lithuania is a transit country for cannabis, which remains the most frequently consumed drug in the country. While less common, evidence suggests that small-scale, local cultivation of cannabis does occur in the country. Cannabis products are usually smuggled into Lithuania from the Netherlands, Spain or Belgium through various maritime and land routes that use the Klaipeda seaport as their main point of entry, or they are trafficked through Poland. Lithuania is also a transit country for cocaine. Although cocaine is the second most seized drug in the country, it remains relatively unpopular among Lithuanians due to its high cost. Most of the cocaine seized in Lithuania enters through Klaipeda, having transited the UK, the Netherlands or Germany, and is destined for Belarus, Russia or Scandinavian countries. Lithuania\u2019s cocaine trade also appears to rely on international connections to South American and African countries, and law enforcement officials have reported occurrences of Lithuanian criminal actors operating in South America while organizing shipments to Europe. There have been reports of the collaboration between Lithuanian and Nigerian drug traffickers for the purposes of smuggling cocaine into Switzerland and Germany. ##&& With regards to heroin, supply generally originates from Central Asia and travels across Russia and Belarus to be redistributed within European markets and the Kaliningrad region of Russia. The smuggling of heroin from Central Asia to Lithuania is carried out by various organized criminal groups of an international nature. While heroin was among the most popular drug in Lithuania until several years ago, it has been gradually replaced in popularity by synthetic opioids such as Carfentanil. As for synthetic drugs, close links have been established between Lithuania, the synthetic drug trade and the organized criminal groups that orchestrate distribution, sale and transport. In north-eastern Europe, the production of synthetic drugs is dominated by Lithuanian and Polish organized crime groups that smuggle the illicit drugs into Russia, Belarus and Scandinavia, where land trafficking routes traverse Poland, Germany, Denmark and Sweden, and Lithuania, Estonia and Sweden by sea. These Lithuanian criminal groups have also been documented trafficking drugs to the UK. In 2016, MDMA\/Ecstasy became the most common illicit stimulant used by young adults. Meanwhile, new psychoactive substances are often imported from China and the Netherlands, mainly by postal or courier services.","text - criminal actors":"There are mafia groups operating in Lithuania. The leadership hierarchy of these groups is often unclear, and most of them are transnational in nature. Despite the fact that they all control defined territory in the country some tensions exist between groups, although there have been no \u2018turf wars\u2019 in the last five years, in contrast to the earlier decade. Mafia-style groups are predominately engaged in drug trafficking, tobacco smuggling, luxury-car theft, human trafficking and money laundering. Over the last five years, numerous groups were targeted by law enforcement activities, and many were arrested and sentenced, resulting in the complete eradication of some groups. Despite the crackdown, stronger and more powerful Lithuanian mafia-style groups have expanded their activities, or even \u2018relocated\u2019 their criminal activity to Western European countries. Meanwhile, criminal networks within Lithuania have become more sophisticated during the last decade. While they still focus on traditional operations involving tobacco and drug smuggling, improvements in technology, law-enforcement capacities and international cooperation have pushed these organized criminal groups to adapt their operations. Smaller networks are concentrated in the cities, while larger ones often operate transnationally. ##&& Organized crime networks often cooperate with South American and Central Asian criminal groups, particularly in drug trafficking. The migration of the Lithuanian population since the country joined the Schengen Area has also played an important role in the expansion of criminal activities, as Lithuanian criminal networks flourish in the European countries with the biggest populations of Lithuanian migrants. Furthermore, some foreign criminal groups use Lithuania as a transit point, due to its geographical placement and links across the wider European region. There are also reports of Russian and Belarusian actors working with Lithuanians to facilitate smuggling. With regards to state-embedded actors, there appears to be little to no collusion between the state and criminal markets. There is, however, recent evidence of corruption and border officers working with organized criminal groups in smuggling operations.","text - leadership and governance":"An institutional framework exists in Lithuania to address the organized crime situation in the country.

Lithuania has also improved the investigative work of the tax office, made declarations of income and assets mandatory for the state service, and improved legislation focused on illegal enrichment. Additionally, all legal enforcement institutions have established anti-corruption departments during the last decade. Furthermore, anti-corruption checks of political candidates are obligatory for parliamentary and municipal elections. Despite this, corruption exists in the country, including bribery and abuse of power involving politicians, businesses and the judiciary, which has contributed to a lower trust in government. Still, corruption levels are low in a global and even European comparison. ##&& On the international level, Lithuania has improved cooperation with law enforcement agencies in the EU and other countries over the last decade. Agreements have been signed that provide for better cooperation, exchange of information and coordinated actions against organized crime. This has resulted in a decline in cases of irregular border crossings and increasing numbers of international operations against drug and arms trafficking, tobacco smuggling, human trafficking and other forms of transnational organized crime. It also allows joint actions against the use of the darknet and social media to facilitate criminality. Law enforcement also cooperates closely with counterparts in the Baltic countries, Russia and, to a lesser degree, Belarus. Additionally, Lithuania has extradition arrangements with the US, and is part of the European Arrest Warrant system. On a domestic level, Lithuania has strict sanctions and policies related to organized crime. Lithuania has also criminalized participating in, and organizing, a criminal association which consists of two or more people.","text - criminal justice and security":"There has been evidence of corruption in the judiciary in Lithuania. In 2019, Lithuanian authorities detained judges and lawyers in a large-scale anti-corruption investigation. The suspects were accused of bribery, trading in influence and abuse of power. Lithuania has also been criticized for extremely high levels of violence, including sexual abuse, intimidation and exploitation among prisoners in the country\u2019s detention facilities. There are also reports of drug trafficking in prisons. There are several law enforcement agencies combating organized crime in Lithuania, many of which are also attempting to fight corruption from within. ##&& Most Lithuanians believe corruption is widespread among police and customs agents. Despite this fact, trust in the Lithuanian police increased between 2004 and 2016. It has been noted that law enforcement agencies are under resourced, which somewhat limits their scope of work, but are still effective relative to the organized crime threat they face. As for territorial integrity, the Suwalki gap, on Lithuania\u2019s eastern border, is the country\u2019s most porous entry point. The State Border Guard Service has also reported a rise in smuggling (mainly of cigarettes, alcohol, drugs and petrol) along the Kaliningrad\u2013Lithuania and Belarus\u2013Lithuania borders.","text - economic and financial environment":"Lithuania has the highest cash usage among the Baltic and Nordic states. At the same time, it has not adopted a threshold on cash usage, which can present a possible vulnerability for the injection of illicit funds into the economy. Furthermore, Lithuania ranks in the top third in the EU in terms of the size of its shadow economy. Nevertheless, the country has one of the freest economies in the world, which would suggest criminal organizations do not exert significant influence over sectors in the legal economy. Lithuania is also ranked as being highly resilient to money laundering and terrorist financing. The country has a financial crime investigation service which works against organized crime, and which has helped it avoid the money laundering scandals that rocked other Baltic nations. Lithuania also has in-depth legislation on money laundering and terrorist financing. However, recent financial scandals involving Lithuania\u2019s banking system, as well as offshore money laundering, cast doubt on the success rate of these policies.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim and witness support services within Lithuania are limited. However, this is changing and since 2014 there has been a rise in witness and victim protection services available through non-governmental organizations and international organizations, as well as increased government support for these services. Similarly, in terms of prevention, there is evidence of regional or national prevention schemes tackling organized crime. Perhaps most notable is the government\u2019s spending on awareness campaigns on human trafficking in major cities through media outlets. With regards to the press, investigative journalism lacks funding. Furthermore, media ownership is usually multinational, with journalists working for several major media groups simultaneously. Currently, initiatives to tackle Kremlin-led disinformation campaigns are at the forefront of the government\u2019s agenda. The media enjoy relative freedom in Lithuania, but the rise in prominence of new anti-establishment political parties may pose a threat to freedom of the press in the coming years.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Vilnius","GDP (current $US million)":"54627.41","Income group":"High income","Population":"2794137","Land Area (sq. km)":"65290","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"38.7","Freedom in the World Index":"90","Human Development Index":"0.88","Global Peace Index":"1.71","Democracy Index":"7.13","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"60","GDP per capita (current US$)":"19551","1":"3.32","1.1":"3.00","1.2":"3.63","2":"7.21"},{"Corresp":"102","ISO-3":"LUX","Country":"Luxembourg","ISO-2":"LU","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Western Europe","Flag file":"lu.png","1.

In 2016, authorities in Luxembourg dismantled an illicit workshop reactivating Slovak firearms to sell in the European market. Seventy people were arrested.

Despite the existence of occasional illicit firearms trading in Luxembourg, the activities appear to be part of a wider transnational network supplying neighbouring countries and not a home-grown domestic market.","text - environment":"There is no tangible evidence of a flora or fauna crimes market operating within Luxembourg. Illegal sturgeon caviar has reportedly been heavily imported in the country until around 2013, but no newer information on illicit caviar flows exists.

More organized distribution networks have developed, leading to greater availability and affordability of the drug, primarily trafficked from the Netherlands and Morocco. Usage is most prevalent among the youth, and Luxembourg has plans to legalize the cultivation, selling and consumption of cannabis. The cocaine market is also growing, with more organized crime networks developing across the country. The drug is primarily brought in from Latin America and moved through Western Europe, although West African crime groups have also developed routes through and into Luxembourg. The consolidation of crime networks in the cocaine market has seen the availability of the drug rise and its price drop, and seizures have risen from 190 kilograms in 2015 to 347 kilograms in 2018. ##&& Luxembourg is a transit and destination country for heroin. The market is moderate, and demand and seizures have remained consistent for two decades, with a small rise in demand in the previous two years. Luxembourg is not a key actor but acts as a consumer on the main transit routes. Most drug traffickers in the country are from North Africa. As a financial hub, Luxembourg may play a pivotal role in the laundering of assets gained from heroin trafficking. The synthetic drug market is small in Luxembourg, and seizures of MDMA and amphetamine-type substances fluctuate each year. While the use of synthetic drugs is scarcely observed in Luxembourg, health services have reported increased use by teenagers. Belgium was the main country of origin for synthetic drugs, and they are very affordable in Luxembourg.","text - criminal actors":"There are no domestic mafia-style groups operating within Luxembourg. There is a presence of loose criminal networks in the country, particularly in the capital and in the Gare district, although organized drug networks operate throughout the country and affect even the smaller cities. West African criminal groups have strengthened their control over drug trafficking in Luxembourg, and police have reported high levels of violence from their activities. As many of the criminal networks are transnational, criminal individuals are often not from Luxembourg. ##&& Most of the criminal networks operating in Luxembourg\u2019s illicit markets are transnational, and while their activity is limited, it is not clear how much control the authorities have over their activities. As revealed in the Luxleaks investigation, Luxembourg tax offices are accused of aggressive fiscal dumping policies which, alongside Luxembourg\u2019s finance and commerce legislation, facilitate criminal activities such as tax evasion and fraud.","text - leadership and governance":"Organized crime is not a major public policy issue in Luxembourg. It is a highly stable country and public trust in the government is very high. Although the level of corruption is very low in Luxembourg, and the state is efficient in publishing policies for review, the legal framework for access to information is very poor. Fighting corruption is the responsibility of the police and prosecution office. Luxembourg has a horizontal committee for corruption prevention, but no specialized independent anti-corruption office. Public authorities regularly organize corruption workshops with the private sector and grant financial support to Transparency International. ##&& Luxembourg has a long history of regular international cooperation. Law enforcement engages in broad and effective international cooperation to combat transnational crime through Europol, INTERPOL and the Schengen Information Service, among others. Luxembourg is an engaged international partner. Luxembourg\u2019s legislators take the fight against human trafficking and exploitation seriously and have various action plans and laws in place to criminalize, prosecute and hopefully deter the practice. However, despite some policies in place, Luxembourg has not ratified the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition, and more could be done to restrict the financing of production and transfer of illicit arms. Luxembourg is among the first countries in Europe with plans to legalize the cultivation, selling and consumption of cannabis. Measures have also been taken to strengthen the enforcement of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, establishing a national coordination committee to tighten sanctions against illegal trade and provide more financial resources to combat flora- and fauna-related crimes.","text - criminal justice and security":"The Directorate of the Judicial Police Service coordinates judicial activities at national and international level, and has a department focused on drugs, organized crime and anti-terrorism. There is no indication that the judicial system has been corrupted by organized crime efforts.

The Service de Renseignement de l\u2019Etat is Luxembourg\u2019s homeland intelligence service, which is responsible for dealing with threats from organized crime. Luxembourg has eight drug law enforcement units, the majority of which are under the Ministry of Internal Security and it has among the highest number of drug enforcement officers per person in Europe. ##&& As a member of the Schengen Area, Luxembourg has relatively open borders, but this does not precipitate vulnerability to various criminal flows, and territorial integrity remains unthreatened. The Grand Ducal Police are responsible for border control and there have been reports of inefficiency in border security. With the closure of borders and lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been reported that drug traffickers have shifted transnational operations to the domestic market.","text - economic and financial environment":"Luxembourg is the main centre for wealth management in the eurozone, and ranks among the top countries globally for investment fund activities, with its financial services accounting for 25% of GDP.

Despite this, Luxembourg is not on the EU tax haven blacklist, though the European Commission referred Luxembourg to the Court of Justice for not fully implementing EU anti-money laundering rules. Luxembourg is assessed to have a moderate risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. ##&& There is no indication that the regulatory environment has been corrupted in Luxembourg. Domestic and foreign businesses are able to operate free from criminal activity and property rights are upheld.

There are currently approximately 5 000 irregular migrants from Africa residing in Malta, as well as reports of networks of Libyan smugglers cooperating with Malta-based facilitators. Since joining the EU and Schengen zone, smuggling has decreased, although a market still exists for smuggling individuals into mainland Europe with fraudulent documents.","text - trade":"While Malta\u2019s location makes it a potentially attractive location for illicit firearms trafficking, legislation on the production and trade of firearms is restrictive, and the market is therefore small. Illicit firearm activity is mainly related to other crimes such as drug trafficking and prostitution rings, and firearm trafficking is not seen as a significant market in its own right. The illegal firearms market, such that it is, is largely run by Italian mafia groups, with weapons being moved into Eastern Europe and the Middle East.","text - environment":"Despite its favourable position between Africa and Europe, there is no evidence of a developed flora crimes market in Malta. However, the country is a hotbed of songbird poaching and illegal tuna fishing, the latter being a hugely profitable market that is facilitated by corruption and poor oversight. Malta\u2019s tuna fish operators have been linked to a \u20ac25 million pan-European scandal, in which an attempt was made to collude with Spanish authorities to legitimize their illegal tuna haul. The European Commission began infringement procedures against Malta in May 2020 for failing to comply with the EU's IUU (illegal, unreported and unregulated) fishing regulation. Because of the large number of birds that migrate between Europe and Africa each year, Malta is also rife with poachers and a smuggling route was discovered between it and Italy in 2018. ##&& Malta does not have an abundance of natural resources. There is therefore a well-developed shadow economy for fuel and oil smuggling, often from North African refineries. Libyan militias and Maltese criminal groups use registered companies in Malta to launder their illegal oil and earn an estimated \u20ac26 million annually. Libyan, Maltese and Italian criminal groups cooperate closely in non-renewable resource crimes.","text - drugs":"Malta is a destination country for cannabis. It is the most widely used drug in the country and large volumes are seized each year. While possession of cannabis for recreational purposes has been partially decriminalized, its use is strongly controlled and limited. The criminal market usually involves foreign actors who are supported by Maltese criminals. Most cannabis arrives in Malta from Morocco (smuggled via Tunisia and Libya) or from Sicily (smuggled via a well-established route). Malta is a destination and transit country for cocaine, most of which is smuggled from South America through Spain. Malta is among the countries with the largest seizures of cocaine, with its container ports being used to transfer significant amounts of the drug. There appears to be cooperation between Libyan and Maltese criminal networks in the cocaine market, and use is rising while prices are dropping. ##&& Malta is predominantly a destination country for synthetic drugs, with foreign and local actors using power boats to move the drug through the Sicily\u2013Malta route. While the market is small, synthetic drug use has increased in recent years. There is no known local manufacturing of synthetic drugs, and online purchasing from China has become the main source for precursor substances. While it operates as a minor transit country, Malta is primarily a destination country for Afghan heroin that is trafficked through Turkey, North Africa and Europe. However, heroin use is low in Malta and has been decreasing steadily since 2006.","text - criminal actors":"There are no identifiable domestic mafia-style groups in Malta, although Italian mafia groups are active in the country. Its location between Africa, Asia and Europe makes it attractive to foreign organized crime networks, and foreign groups are embedded in most Maltese criminal markets. Maltese criminal groups usually work with influential foreign groups such as La Cosa Nostra and the \u2018Ndrangheta in the illegal movement of people and commodities. Various criminal groups are involved in human trafficking from China, Eastern Europe and North Africa, and there is a strong foreign influence in the illegal drug, fuel and money laundering markets. ##&& Loose criminal networks are prevalent in Malta and act across most of the criminal markets in the country. Despite their having only moderate access to weapons, there is a high level of violence by criminal groups, including bomb attacks, facilitated by inefficient law enforcement. There have been a number of high-level corruption scandals in Malta \u2013 most notably, the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in 2017, while she was investigating allegations of corruption in the awarding of public contracts worth US$517 million. This caused international alarm and raised concerns that high-level government officials were preventing the police from investigating possible collusion between criminal groups and the state. Criminal actors are believed to extract resources from the state through corrupt contracts and public procurement; and the Maltese system of political party financing has been strongly criticized as a way of allowing private interests to bribe and control politicians.","text - leadership and governance":"Following the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia and the fall of the previous government, Prime Minister Robert Abela pledged to restore the rule of law and the government publicly communicated its position against organized crime. However, these commitments have yet to be tested. Law enforcement is still poorly resourced, which has a negative impact on state-oversight mechanisms, and the perception of government corruption has worsened steadily over the past two decades. Opinion polls still reveal a high level of perceived corruption, especially in public procurement, despite the range of anti-corruption measures enshrined in the Maltese criminal code. The government has been criticized for not dealing with conflicts of interests, while the statute of limitations on corruption charges for public officials was removed. Allegations of corruption, the misuse of state resources and the inappropriate use of office are widespread. Access to information is limited, there are no independent oversight bodies in Malta, and the commission against corruption is woefully understaffed. ##&& Malta has ratified many UN protocols related to the major criminal markets and is a member of the Council of Europe\u2019s Group of States against Corruption. The Maltese police have a specific unit that works and shares information with INTERPOL, and the government cooperates well with the EU and other international bodies as part of its strategy to combat the trafficking of drugs, arms and humans. However, Malta is less willing to comply with international standards against state corruption \u2013 particularly with regard to law enforcement. The activities of organized crime groups are criminalized in Malta. However, there are no criminal association laws, which reportedly hinders investigations, especially of high-profile individuals that may have been involved In the cover-up of Daphne Caruana Galizia's murder. Malta has laws in place to cover human trafficking and smuggling, environmental crime and drug trafficking. Arms trafficking is not explicitly criminalized, but it is covered by provisions in the Maltese arms act. Ordinary criminal law is responsible for covering organized crime proceedings, and there are provisions in place for the investigation and prosecution of corruption offences.","text - criminal justice and security":"With the exception of corruption, Malta does not have a judicial unit focused specifically on organized crime. While the justice system is often criticized for depending on the police to initiate criminal proceedings on corruption, a new prosecution office has recently been created, which presents an opportunity for improvement. Malta\u2019s courts are not effective in passing judgments against the defendants of organized crime, and there have been incidents of corruption, including a case in which three members of the judiciary were charged for accepting bribes to alter sentencing. Malta has one prison, which operates above its maximum capacity (the prison population has doubled over two decades), but it meets international standards regarding the fundamental rights of prisoners. ##&& Malta\u2019s law enforcement infrastructure is chronically under-resourced and lacking in expertise, especially with regard to the police force's investigative capabilities, which undermines its anti-organized crime efforts and public trust. Specialized police departments have been set up for drug-trafficking and economic crimes \u2013 and, despite a lack of resources, have been reasonably successful. The government hopes to establish an agency to fight financial organized crime and prosecute money laundering offences. Malta participates effectively in international intelligence sharing and police cooperation, as well as in the European Patrols Network to help address irregular migration. ##&& Malta is at a crossroad for illegal trafficking, and its strategic location and accessibility to Italian criminal groups have made its borders vulnerable. Italian mafia groups are highly active in Malta, which has led to the government recently entering into an agreement with Italy to improve border control. Malta has a customs service and a specialized immigration unit to control its points of entry and suppress irregular migration. However, its borders remain porous, with moderate corruption and bribery risks.","text - economic and financial environment":"Malta is highly vulnerable to money laundering. Given its international status as a finance centre, the country\u2019s banking sector is large and internationally exposed. Despite efforts to better understand money laundering risks, the country remains vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing. The money laundering unit within the Maltese police force works with international authorities to assist with money laundering investigations, while the financial intelligence unit works to prevent economic crimes. Malta has made efforts to understand its money laundering risks, but the limited financial resources it provides for its various law enforcement units undermines their capabilities. Malta lags behind most of its European counterparts with regard to the ease of doing business in the country. While it is relatively straightforward to set up and operate a business legally in Malta, there is evidence of corrupt practices, especially in the awarding of public contracts. In 2016 Malta overhauled its public procurement procedures to align itself with EU directives, but there are still concerning connections between some local elites and political figures that threaten fair competition. There are opportunities for businesses to expand, but these are hampered by inefficient government bureaucracy.","text - civil society and social protection":"In 2017, Malta launched a victim support unit within its police force to provide counselling and education for the victims of crimes. The national welfare agency offers medical care, employment services and legal counsel for the victims of human trafficking. The government also funds training for labour officials on victim identification and referral. Overall, witness protection is well legislated; however, in the case of Daphne Caruana Galizia it was reported that the police protection programme was stopped without reason before her death, sparking fears of interference by state-embedded criminal actors. Malta's national drugs policy emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of drug addiction. There are a limited number of organized crime prevention strategies in Malta. The most glaring gap is in preventative law enforcement, where there is not enough emphasis on emerging threats such as the recent proliferation of unregulated massage parlours and strip clubs. However, organizations such as the Malta Migrants Association recognize that integration is one of the most effective measures against organized crime. Malta's national drug policy framework provides for preventative education campaigns, and its welfare services implement preventative measures alongside NGOs. The nationwide LEAP project aims to consolidate community resources to address social exclusion and prevent criminality. ##&& While the role of civil society organizations in combating organized crime in Malta is not large, the state is open to fostering a strong, independent civil society and supports non-state actors in their activities. The National Commission on Domestic Violence, for example, recently organized a five day, anti-trafficking event to demonstrate the role the private sector can play in limiting criminal markets. The media environment has worsened in recent years, with a number of attacks on free speech and a culture of intimidation and threats, culminating in the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia. There is a lack of data on the media industry, inadequate protection and self-regulation, and concerning levels of political ownership of media outlets.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Valletta","GDP (current $US million)":"14989.42","Income group":"High income","Population":"504062","Land Area (sq. km)":"320","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"36.2","Freedom in the World Index":"90","Human Development Index":"0.9","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"7.68","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"53","GDP per capita (current US$)":"29737","1":"4.65","1.1":"4.05","1.2":"5.25","2":"5.17"},{"Corresp":"114","ISO-3":"MDA","Country":"Moldova","ISO-2":"MD","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Central & Eastern Europe","Flag file":"md.png","1.

The majority of victims, usually women, are from rural areas with low levels of education, and there is a concerning rise in the exploitation of disadvantaged children, especially for pornography. This market is facilitated by some degree of corruption from high-level officials in government. ##&& Information about the human smuggling market in Moldova appears to reference the early stages of human trafficking, where Moldovans are offered the chance to leave the country irregularly but those who accept are instead diverted into the trafficking market. As such a high number of Moldovans are eager to leave the country, this deceptive practice is widespread. Nevertheless, the criminal market for human smuggling is limited and there is little involvement of organized criminal actors in this activity.","text - trade":"Moldova is a source and transit country for arms trafficking. The organized criminal groups that dominate the market run sophisticated and well-structured operations. Some use ostensibly legitimate companies as a front to mask their involvement in arms trafficking. Moldova has a surplus of weapons left over from the Soviet era and trades closely with Odessa in Ukraine, particularly out of the de facto sovereign state of Transnistria.","text - environment":"The fact that the country has little forest cover means there is little flora-related crime in Moldova. The illegal logging industry reached its peak in 2012, but legislation introduced in recent years to counter it has prevented the growth of this criminal market. The fauna crime market is similarly limited. However, there are criminal networks of dog handlers who train and export dogs to fight abroad. In addition, criminal groups engage in the export of illegal black caviar from Russia into Italy. Despite Moldova\u2019s poor environmental performance, non-renewable resource crimes do not appear to be prevalent. However, the country is highly dependent on oil imports, which creates an opportunity for criminal networks to become involved in oil smuggling.","text - drugs":"Historically, cannabis has been the most commonly consumed drug in Moldova, with most demand coming from within the country itself, alongside limited demand from Ukraine and Russia. Corrupt practices by state officials are fairly common, with some high-level politicians being significant facilitators of the market. Moldova is a source and transit country for synthetic drugs, with criminal networks producing the drugs for export into Ukraine and Russia. MDMA is widely consumed throughout the country and many users are currently addicted to synthetic drugs. Social media platforms are used to facilitate the sale of new psychoactive substances. ##&& Moldova operates as a small transit country for heroin, where foreign transnational organized crime groups move the drug from Turkey into neighbouring countries and the EU. Moldova also has small laboratories dedicated to producing opium for local consumption, but those involved are predominantly the drug users themselves. The heroin market within Moldova is small and has been further reduced by COVID-19.

Loose criminal networks also operate within the country, particularly in the trafficking of humans and arms, while violence is moderate but widespread. These networks are also active in Transnistria, as well as other territories bordering Ukraine and Odessa. ##&& Corrupt state-embedded actors are often used by criminal groups to facilitate their activities, and while their criminal involvement rarely extends beyond this, there are notable cases of politicians playing active roles in criminal networks. The most common crimes carried out by actors within the state are money laundering and voter fraud, alongside the use of state resources for services provided to criminal enterprises. There are reports of collaboration between Russian criminal actors and Moldovan politicians, particularly inside Transnistria. The foreign criminal groups most involved in the Moldovan criminal markets come from Russia, Georgia and Ukraine. There is moderate cooperation between these groups, especially in relation to complex cross-border markets such as human trafficking, but no foreign criminal groups exert dominance over local criminal markets.","text - leadership and governance":"The political leadership is not trusted by the public in Moldova, with corruption and criminal facilitation being widespread and many believe that the government mainly consists of Russian-funded politicians. In 2014, political leaders were found to have embezzled money from the banking system, but subsequent governments have been unable to apprehend the culprits or retrieve any of the embezzled funds. Because of the level of corruption and the unwillingness of the government to fulfil its election campaign promises, there are concerns that the state is vulnerable to being captured by powerful criminal interests. However, these fears were partly allayed in 2019 when the country held its first open-list election where the voters could influence the structure of parties and the government itself. Despite widespread corruption, the government is relatively transparent. ##&& Despite delays in signing treaties, Moldova is a signatory to UN treaties that aim to end drug and arms trafficking, although these conventions are not implemented in the territory of Transnistria. Moldova is also a founding member of the Police Cooperation Convention for Southeast Europe, which allows for data exchange between organized crime intelligence bodies. On the ground, national law enforcement is praised by international partners for their willingness to cooperate in disrupting organized crime activities. Moldova\u2019s legislative efforts to curb and prevent organized crime have a mixed record of success and are incomplete. For example, there are laws related to drug and arms trafficking, but policies relating to the illegal movement of people fails to distinguish between human trafficking and smuggling. There are minimal and poorly developed laws relating to fauna, flora and non-renewable resource crimes, although these crime markets are not well established in the country.","text - criminal justice and security":"The Moldovan judicial system has proven its inability to prosecute high-level crimes. The justice system itself has been implicated in crime, with 16 judges and four court bailiffs being arrested for their role in money laundering in 2016. There have also been reports of physical abuse and institutionalised torture within the detention system. Inmates have created powerful informal hierarchy structures inside prisons that have become a breeding ground for criminal activity. ##&& Corruption is rife in Moldovan law enforcement agencies, with the police neglecting victims and abusing their powers while also actively facilitating and participating in human trafficking. Small-scale bribery is pervasive among local law enforcement officials, which has undermined public trust in their ability to maintain law and order. As a former territory within the USSR, Moldova has found it difficult to assert authority over its border since its independence in 1991. The most prominent example of this is the breakaway state of Transnistria, on the border of Ukraine, which has declared independence from Moldova. Transnistria has extensive links with organized criminal groups and it has become a hub for arms trafficking.","text - economic and financial environment":"Money laundering is at the centre of Moldova\u2019s corruption problems. The most notable case was in 2015 when large sums of money were siphoned from the Moldovan central bank, which culminated in the bankruptcy of the three largest banks in the country. Many politicians and criminal groups have taken advantage of Moldova\u2019s ineffective anti-money laundering measures over the years and the country remains highly vulnerable to this type of crime. ##&& The economic and regulatory landscape in Moldova is not favourable to business and bribery and money laundering are well-entrenched in the economy. However, the government has taken small steps to rectify this with the introduction of measures that aim to prevent criminal involvement in legitimate business. Nevertheless, business confidence has been damaged by high-level financial scandals involving the banking system and illegal proceeds from Russia.","text - civil society and social protection":"Despite recent legislative attempts to improve victim support and protection, there has been little success in this area. For example, the victims do not receive adequate support from the state, which relies on NGOs and other non-state actors to fund and provide the needed support. Furthermore, despite the government having discussed a national strategy for the prevention of organized crime, a coherent plan has yet to be drawn up. Most preventative measures are carried out by civil society organizations (CSOs), which do not receive funding or assistance from the government. The government does not only deny support to CSOs, but, in 2017, introduced a bill that prevented NGOs from receiving international funding. Moldova\u2019s media environment is extremely polarized and vulnerable to external influences and editorial censorship.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Chisinau","GDP (current $US million)":"11968.71","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"2663251","Land Area (sq. km)":"33850","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"67","Freedom in the World Index":"61","Human Development Index":"0.75","Global Peace Index":"1.95","Democracy Index":"5.78","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"34","GDP per capita (current US$)":"4494","1":"4.45","1.1":"3.90","1.2":"5.00","2":"3.71"},{"Corresp":"115","ISO-3":"MCO","Country":"Monaco","ISO-2":"MC","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Southern Europe","Flag file":"mc.png","1.

Individuals who own firearms require government licenses and are subject to rigorous background checks. Monaco therefore has a very low firearm offence rate and the arms trafficking market in the principality is negligible, with the only apparent involvement of the country in the transnational market being their hosting of a renowned arms dealer.","text - environment":"The French customs authorities in charge of border controls in Monaco have often made seizures of endangered and illicit flora species on luxury yachts in the port, but this appears to be the extent of the flora crimes market in the country. Monaco is totally urbanized and, with the exception of isolated incidents, there is very little evidence to suggest any sort of illicit fauna crimes market. There does not appear to be an active criminal market for smuggling of non-renewable resources, but allegations point to bribes being paid to officials in return for lucrative contracts in the oil industry.","text - drugs":"Cannabis is a popular drug in Monaco and is used predominantly by young males. Reports suggest that, as with cocaine, individuals often travel to France to purchase the drug. While it is illegal in Monaco, discrete use seems to be tolerated by the authorities. There is no evidence that the cannabis market is any larger than small-scale individual distribution, though there is a trend towards cultivation. Monaco is a destination country for small quantities of cocaine that are brought in from France. In 2018, French police dismantled a cocaine trafficking route run by two brothers based in Menton and Monaco. However, the market is limited to episodic individual-level distribution. ##&& The trafficking of heroin in Monaco is also extremely limited, with data suggesting that it is not a drug used by students or the wider population. The supply points for the small amounts of heroin brought into the country are located in neighbouring French cities. There appears to be a similarly small synthetic drug market, though there is concern that the growing use of ecstasy in Western and Central Europe may spread to Monaco.","text - criminal actors":"There is no evidence to suggest that any domestic mafia-style groups operate in Monaco, but groups from nearby countries seem to be active. Due to Monaco\u2019s history as a tax haven and its strict banking secrecy, it has attracted individuals with ties to organized crime. The majority of Monaco\u2019s population is not native to the principality, and this facilitates the operations of foreign criminal actors and organizations. There is strong evidence that individuals with transnational organized crime links do business in Monaco, such as mafia groups from Italy, Russia and former Soviet states. Foreign actors allegedly use connections in Monaco to launder the oil profits of the Tambovskaya gang. ##&& There is scant evidence for the presence of criminal networks in the country. It is likely that loose criminal structures cooperate with foreign criminal actors, and are involved in the laundering of criminal proceeds in Monaco. The only notable recent example of criminal activity by state-embedded actors was the so-called vast influence-peddling scandal of 2017, which involved Russian oligarchs and prompted the resignation of the principality\u2019s minister of justice. Despite this, the state does not appear to have been infiltrated by criminal interests.","text - leadership and governance":"Organized crime is not a significant problem in Monaco, and there is no evidence to suggest any kind of state capture by organized criminals. There is a high level of confidence in the democratic and election processes; however, concerns have been raised about the principality's low level of compliance with anti-corruption recommendations. While there are anti-corruption squads in the principality's law enforcement agencies, corruption, although well-hidden, is present. Thus, GRECO has voiced concerns over the Monaco's compliance with international anti-corruption standards. Access to information in Monaco is extremely poor, and the principality faces pressure from the international community to reform its banking secrecy laws. ##&& Monaco has signed international treaties and conventions related to all the major criminal markets. However, its progress from ratification to implementation has been slow. The principality has cooperation agreements in place with INTERPOL, Europol and Francopol. It also has bilateral extradition agreements with many countries in Western and Eastern Europe, as well as with the US and Australia. Monaco's national legislation, which is continually updated and improved, provides it with protection against the majority of criminal markets.","text - criminal justice and security":"Individuals sentenced for common-law offences in Monaco are transferred to prisons in France and subject to French legislation. The vast majority of prisoners are foreign. It appears that the principality has complete control over its domestic prison system, with the rights of prisoners provided for and very low levels of corruption reported. ##&& The policing system is strong in Monaco, with one of the highest officers-to-population ratios in the world. This, combined with the low level of organized crime in the principality, ensures that its criminal markets are policed effectively. Monaco customs duties fall under French jurisdiction, and capital is free to flow between the countries without restriction or tax collection. As a result, Monaco falls under the customs body of the EU. It appears to have some capacity for monitoring illicit cross-border activities, though this is proportionate to the low levels of threat.","text - economic and financial environment":"Historically, Monaco has been seen as an uncooperative tax haven. It came under significant international pressure to adopt the OECD Model Tax Convention in 2009, and since then has pursued an active policy of combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Monaco has adopted mechanisms recommended by the Financial Action Task Force and has regularly amended and strengthened its compliance with international standards. The government created a financial investigation unit and is modernizing the country's banking and financial sector to make it more resilient to money laundering threats. ##&& While Monaco is proactive and effective in its prosecution of domestic crimes of extortion, there are concerns that its tolerant regulatory environment with regard to transnational organized crime is extremely problematic.","text - civil society and social protection":"Monaco has laws providing for the compensation and legal representation of victims of crimes, especially with regard to sexual violence. The Victims of Criminal Offences Help Association works to prevent violence against victims and witnesses, and operates free of charge, alongside other victim-support programmes and mental-health services. Monaco is a signatory to numerous international treaties designed to prevent organized crime; however, it appears unable to prevent authoritarian heads of state and corrupt individuals from entering its borders and operating within them. The principality seems to prefer ethical charters rather than robust legislation to guide its prevention efforts. ##&& There are no restrictions on the formation of NGOs, but the civil-society sector is weak. Civil liberties, including freedom of expression within the media, are fully respected in Monaco.

Only 22 victims were formally identified between 2015\u20132019, but there has been a growing trend towards sophisticated forms of trafficking and slavery to facilitate cybercrimes. There is evidence of child sex trafficking in the country and children from minority ethnic backgrounds are particularly at risk of forced begging and forced marriage. ##&& As a result of the broader regional migration crisis, there has been an increase in human smuggling in Montenegro. While Montenegro is not part of the main Western Balkans migration route, it serves as a transit country from Turkey and Greece into central Europe. However, due to the country\u2019s difficult terrain and less developed transport infrastructure, it is not as important as some of its neighbouring countries.","text - trade":"Montenegro is positioned along one of the most significant transit routes for arms trafficking in the region, from Serbia to the Middle East, Russia to North Africa (particularly Libya), and the Balkans to Western Europe, as well as from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Serbia and Kosovo. Weapons are usually smuggled in with legal cargo in private vehicles. Following the Yugoslav conflict, light weapons were in heavy circulation and remain easily accessible on the black market today, with Montenegro having one of the highest numbers of civilian-held firearms globally. Although the trade is highly profitable for criminal groups, levels of arms trafficking sharply declined between 2017 and 2018, and organized crime groups have moved away from arms and into cigarette and drug smuggling.","text - environment":"Illicit logging takes place in the northern parts of Montenegro, primarily as a way for poor villagers to secure their livelihoods, and there is little evidence of criminal networks managing these activities. Nonetheless, small criminal groups are involved in illicit logging along the border with Albania and Kosovo, as the moratorium on logging in the former has created more demand and increased profits. Where illicit logging takes place in state-owned forests, the government appears unable or unwilling to tackle the issue. Fauna crime is a moderate but growing market in Montenegro and the mountainous region around the Danube basin is often used for smuggling animals and animal parts. There have been violent clashes between poachers and environmental activists, but no organized crime networks appear to have been involved. Lake Skadar attracts illegal fishing, particularly of carp, though mainly by locals without organized crime links. Albanian organized crime groups are thought to smuggle illegal fuel from Montenegro in high quantities, and fuel is also smuggled into Montenegro from Novi Pazar in Serbia.","text - drugs":"Montenegro is a transit country for heroin, where Albanian and Kosovar heroin is smuggled into Serbia and the EU. Several organized crime groups are involved in the market bringing with them significant levels of violence. Despite its role as a transit country, domestic consumption of heroin remains low. ##&& Montenegro is primarily a transit country, and to some extent a destination country, for cocaine. Montenegro is the main entry point for cocaine trafficked through the Balkans into the EU, particularly cocaine coming from Latin America. The market is controlled by several mafia-style groups, most notably the Kavac clan and the \u0160kaljari clan. High levels of violence are associated with the trade. However, local consumption is relatively low because of the high price of the drug. ##&& Montenegro is a major transit country for cannabis originating from Albania and transported to Bosnia and Serbia. Cannabis is also the most seized and consumed drug in the country, with a visible increase in consumption rates over the last decade. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of cannabis increased due to a higher demand for recreational use. The production of synthetic drugs is also on the rise in Montenegro, with several laboratories being detected in recent years. In line with more production, consumption rates are also increasing, albeit from relatively low levels. Because of the small size of the market, there is little evidence of organized crime involvement.","text - criminal actors":"The domestic and transnational criminal markets are dominated by mafia-style groups in Montenegro, especially the rival groups from the town of Kotor, Skaljari and Kavac, which vie for territory and dominance over criminal markets. Violence between these groups is common, and often spills over the border into Serbia, with the cocaine market generating the most violence. Criminal networks are well consolidated and highly sophisticated, often cooperating with mafia-style groups and with corrupt law enforcement and politicians. These groups are not as powerful as the mafia-groups but cooperate with them in facilitating crime. ##&& State actors are heavily involved in the criminal markets, with law enforcement, secret service and politicians providing protection to criminal actors and their assets. The political leadership of the country has remained unchanged for almost 30 years, establishing a powerful network of corrupt government officials, private companies and criminal actors involved in managing the illicit markets. In 2020, however, the previous leadership gave way to the newly elected government, which declared anti-corruption efforts and the accession of Montenegro to the EU as its main priorities. Serbian criminal groups play a highly influential role in Montenegro\u2019s criminal markets, as historically did Russian criminal groups, whose influence has waned since the 2016 coup and NATO accession. Turkish criminal actors are attempting to integrate themselves more into Montenegro\u2019s criminal markets.","text - leadership and governance":"The country's governing party had been in power since 1991 and had shown little political will to curb organized crime, before giving way to the newly elected government in December 2020. The state appears, to a certain extent, to have been captured by organized criminal interests. Despite having a constitutional parliamentary system, in 2018 measures were brought to greatly expand presidential powers and further weaken parliamentary oversight. Public trust in the state was low throughout 2020 and criminal groups were often protected by the governing elite. Corruption and cronyism remains widespread, with modest efforts by authorities, prompted by the EU accession rules, producing limited results. Several high-profile corruption and bribery cases in recent years have not prompted appropriate action from the authorities. The functioning of the state administration lacks legal clarity and there are no effective accountability processes. Transparency in law and order is limited, and efforts to improve this are narrow and poorly implemented. ##&& International cooperation has improved significantly in recent years, especially after the country joined NATO and signed bilateral agreements with the US and other western and neighbouring countries. The country has participated closely with EU arms trafficking policy and co-lead EMPACT. Montenegro benefits from EU funded projects to increase the effectiveness of and cooperation between regional and national authorities in tackling organized crime. Montenegro also has a good record of cooperating with law enforcement agencies such as INTERPOL. However, criminal capture of parts of the state apparatus limits the scope and effectiveness of international cooperation. Although Montenegro has among the highest number of national policies and strategies dedicated to combating organized crime in the region, there are severe deficiencies in their implementation and gaps in their Criminal Procedure Code. However, some progress has been seen in the fight against human trafficking, following the government\u2019s implementation of a nationwide anti-trafficking strategy.","text - criminal justice and security":"Corruption is widespread within the justice system, and 2018 saw the release of secret recordings that implicated high-ranking justice officials in bribery and corruption. Moreover, judicial capacity in Montenegro is low and there is much political interference in the courts. This means that despite an adequate legal and regulatory framework in place to tackle organized crime, court implementation is ineffective. Meanwhile, the prison system does not meet international standards for healthcare, education and human rights. Law enforcement is fragmented and under-resourced, lacking in professionalism and technical skills. There is an absence of measures to ensure there is no political interference in the operation of law-enforcement bodies that are currently unable to maintain integrity in their investigations. Law enforcement is often used as a tool by the ruling party, especially around election time. ##&& Montenegro has a long and vulnerable coastline with a number of seaports used as trafficking points which have seen a proliferation of trafficking, especially in cocaine. Government officials' own involvement in cigarette smuggling has led to an unwillingness to tighten border controls, however, there has been more cooperation with the EU custom authorities to address this issue in recent years. The government\u2019s strategic framework for managing its border has focused on increasing skills and analytical capacity, improving checks of cargo ships as well as greater cooperation between border police and customs. Overall, the border police still lack sufficient funding and resources, and corruption is a constant issue.","text - economic and financial environment":"Montenegro meets the minimum requirements for fiscal transparency according to the US State Department, and while anti-money laundering laws and units are in place, their application is weak and ineffective. The tools for freezing, handling and confiscating criminal assets are inadequate, and known criminals feel protected enough to put their own names to their illicit assets. The Council of Europe has raised concerns about the lack of capacity and professionalism in anti-money laundering and terrorist financing activities. ##&& Montenegro performs reasonably well in the area of economic capacity, with credit being easily accessible along with simple cross-border trade and tax regimes. The economy has grown with low to moderate inflation, but there is high public debt, poor protection of minority investors and low property rights. The weakness of the rule of law and unfair competition from the informal economy damages the business environment, in addition to the labour market facing structural challenges and high unemployment.","text - civil society and social protection":"Although Montenegro\u2019s witness protection programme could be improved, it meets most internationally recognized mechanisms to help victims exit modern slavery. Montenegro has two strategies in place to support human trafficking victims, but little action has been taken and the specialized units have insufficient resources to identify victims effectively. Montenegro has sectoral strategies and action plans in place to fight against organized crime, however state authorities (law enforcement and prosecutors) need more operational capacity and cooperation to be effective. The police in Montenegro are decentralized and work closely with local communities which helps prevent some minor criminal activity, but the Anti-Corruption Agency is perceived as insufficiently independent and proactive. As criminal activity is strongly linked to state actors in Montenegro, the prevention response still lacks political will and legal and technical assistance. ##&& The media environment is censorious and intimidatory, with violence against journalists and attacks from the government commonplace. As part of its EU accession process, some efforts have been made to involve civil society in policy discussions, but these have been superficial. Civil society organizations are also highly influenced by Russian disinformation campaigns and those that intensify social divides.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Podgorica","GDP (current $US million)":"5542.58","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"622028","Land Area (sq. km)":"13810","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"58.5","Freedom in the World Index":"63","Human Development Index":"0.83","Global Peace Index":"1.94","Democracy Index":"5.77","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"45","GDP per capita (current US$)":"8910","1":"6.00","1.1":"5.00","1.2":"7.00","2":"4.46"},{"Corresp":"124","ISO-3":"NLD","Country":"Netherlands","ISO-2":"NL","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Western Europe","Flag file":"nl.png","1.

Based on the number of reported human trafficking victims, the Netherlands is among the worst-affected countries in Europe, with Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria being notable origin countries. Sex trafficking, sexual exploitation and other forms of forced labour are all prevalent in the country, and the Netherlands is also a source country for child-sex tourists, a form of sex trafficking to which asylum seekers are particularly vulnerable. Although visibility of human trafficking cases has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of victims may be increasing as more people face economic hardship and become increasingly vulnerable to exploitation as a result. ##&& The Netherlands also plays a role as a transit country for human smuggling from continental Europe to the UK. Often, smuggling takes place step-by-step via hubs and involves criminal networks, rather than mafia-style groups or rackets. Suspected smugglers in the Netherlands include Dutch, as well as other EU nationals, whereas foreign nationals typically work as drivers transporting migrants. Moreover, the closure of the French refugee camp in Calais, and the subsequent escalation in policing there, may have resulted in increased human smuggling activity through the Netherlands.","text - trade":"The Netherlands is a transit country for illegal arms from Belgium, Germany and Eastern Europe and a source country for firearms destined for the UK. The Netherlands is also a destination country for illegal firearms originating in Serbia and Slovakia. The import of firearms is usually run by a relatively small group of arms dealers that have connections in countries such as Poland, Croatia, Slovakia, and to some extent the Antilles. Many brokers are also part of larger criminal networks and form occasional coalitions. While the market is established, it is not extensive in scope or value.","text - environment":"The Netherlands is an important transit and destination country for the illicit trade of endangered plant species from origin countries such as Indonesia, Madagascar and Panama. The import and domestic sale of ornamental plants is also big business, partly maintained by the persistent illicit trade in endangered ornamental plants smuggled in luggage by individuals, mail parcels and legal shipments imported by companies. Additionally, while illegal logging is not a significant issue within the Netherlands itself, illegal timber is estimated to make up a small proportion of total imports. The Netherlands is also a destination and transit hub for illicitly traded fauna and, to a lesser extent, a source country for wild-caught songbirds, waterfowl and birds of prey. Organized crime is not heavily involved in the market, although criminal networks do conduct fauna smuggling operations. Dutch wildlife traders have also been involved in international wildlife smuggling rings, focusing mostly on live reptiles and birds from Latin America, Africa and Asia. Schiphol Airport acts as a key transit point for illicit wildlife smuggled from Latin America and Africa to Asia and the US. The traders involved in the market commit fraud and engage in tax evasion, and money laundering as illicit profits can be substantial. Regarding non-renewable resource crimes, the Dutch Caribbean is a popular trading hub for gold trafficking from Venezuela to Europe. Criminal actors involved in gold trafficking and illegal mining activities generally overlap with mafia-style groups active throughout Latin America. In addition, Dutch oil companies are linked to corruption and illegalities in Africa and Latin America.","text - drugs":"The Netherlands can be considered a global leader when it comes to the production, export and consumption of synthetic drugs. It is thought to be among the largest, if not the largest producer of amphetamines and MDMA\/Ecstasy in the world. \u2018Travellers\u2019 in the south and motorcycle gangs primarily control production. A significant portion of the laboratory equipment, raw materials and chemicals required for synthetic drugs production is sourced from China, making Dutch-Chinese transnational crime an important but often overlooked aspect of the synthetic drugs supply chain. With regard to cocaine, the Netherlands is one of the most significant markets in Europe, serving as a key gateway to Europe from the Americas. The cocaine trade mainly concerns big scale imports from South America. Whereas Amsterdam is the epicentre of drug distribution, Utrecht also plays a key role in the international cocaine trade. Albanian mafia groups dominate the market in the Netherlands. ##&& The Netherlands is also well known for its domestic production and export of cannabis, and cannabis is also the most popular illicit substance used amongst adults. The use of Ecstasy and cocaine, in comparison, is much lower. Morocco is a key origin country for most of the hashish sold in the Netherlands and Moroccan gangs are increasingly involved in the production of cannabis within the country too. Overall, the local market is moderate and dominated by tourists. Additionally, given the toleration of cannabis, the market takes place in the open and is not considered a significant source of local violence, though supply chains remain illegal and uncontrolled. The heroin trade is on the small to moderate scale in the Netherlands, as the country primarily operates as a transit point. However, while local heroin consumption is declining, there has been an increase in heroin trade, transit and production. The heroin market contributes to gang feuds and rivalries. Although heroin is not as prevalent as cocaine, the major criminal networks trafficking both drugs are largely identical.","text - criminal actors":"Most organized crime is run by loose criminal networks. Dutch networks, casually tied by ethnicity, familial and friendship connections, are generally part of what is colloquially known as the penose \u2013 the criminal underbelly of the country. However, none of these formations go beyond partially overlapping ad hoc business ties that rely on pre-existing social networks. Criminal networks are involved in street-level drug sales, prostitution and arms trafficking; and there is only medium-level intergroup violence. Networks are concentrated mainly in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. Most criminal actors in the Netherlands are not mafia-style organizations but criminal networks without internal cohesion and solidified structures. As a result, Dutch networks can overlap in terms of territory and membership. However, there are numerous outlawed motorcycle gangs active in the Netherlands, which have mafia-type organizations. These motorcycle gangs are involved in various criminal markets, including the production and trade of synthetic drugs, arms trafficking and human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation and prostitution. Furthermore, although these groups do not carry weapons openly, weapons have been found at their headquarters. ##&& There are prominent foreign actors involved in criminal markets in the Netherlands. There is also an increasing amount of inter-connectedness between these actors. Furthermore, there is evidence of a moderate number of low-level state-embedded actors facilitating criminal markets through information leaks and police infiltration. There is also corruption on the municipal level involving the building industry.","text - leadership and governance":"Since the 1990s, organized crime has been a clear governmental priority. Nevertheless, opposition parties do not usually raise organized crime as a campaigning issue, which may be because organized crime is not perceived to directly affect public safety. This perception is slightly different in Amsterdam, where the social impact of human trafficking and the narcotics trade are perhaps more visible. More recently, the government has taken a more diverse view of criminal actors involved, acknowledging the variety of actors from loose criminal networks to transnational groups. There has also been a shift within law enforcement towards recognizing that the Netherlands is, with slight variations per substance, a destination as well as production and transit country for illicit markets. While corruption is, overall, not seen as a major issue, a number of scandals have emerged that involved top public-sector executives. Furthermore, police and customs officials were prosecuted for helping drug traffickers in increasing numbers. However, the mechanisms in place are still effective to investigate and prosecute corruption. ##&& At the international level, the Netherlands is highly engaged in various forms of cooperation to combat organized crime. The Netherlands has signed all relevant international treaties and conventions addressing organized crime and cooperates on a bilateral level with several countries to combat drug trafficking. On the domestic level, Dutch law criminalizes participation in an organization aiming to commit criminal offences, as well as membership in terrorist organizations. In addition, Dutch law prohibits all forms of human trafficking and criminalizes people who help enable entry to or travel through the Netherlands. The country also has national legislation against drug trafficking and defines drug trafficking as a criminal offence. Although wildlife crime is not a political priority, Dutch legislation against fauna crime is fairly strict. However, there are no specific laws regarding non-renewable resource crimes.","text - criminal justice and security":"The Netherlands has two units in the judiciary branch specifically dedicated to different aspects of transnational organized crime. Furthermore, the judicial system has had multiple successes prosecuting organized crime over the last decade. Overall, the Dutch prison system is seen as less vulnerable to criminal infiltration than some of its neighbours. Additionally, over the course of the last decade, the Netherlands has closed down 23 prisons due to decreasing crime rates. In terms of law enforcement, the Dutch police have a \u2018national unit\u2019 responsible for domestic policing, counterterrorism and combating organized crime. Nevertheless, Dutch law enforcement has faced claims of taking a naive stance against transnational organized crime and understaffing its forces. Regarding territorial integrity, given its port and central location, the Netherlands is one of the major trafficking routes for drugs, illicit firearms, and people. As part of the Schengen area, the Netherlands also has no permanent physical border controls for those within the region. The Dutch border police question everyone travelling outside of the Schengen area, while a separate mobile control force conducts police checks at the Belgian and German borders, with a particular eye on illegal immigration and transborder crime.","text - economic and financial environment":"Since the 1990s, the Netherlands has focused on reducing administrative burdens for business. The minister of justice has announced intentions to intensify the coordination of anti-organized crime checks and regulations, together with the business sector, to prevent criminal actors from exploiting legitimate businesses for illicit purposes, such as money laundering. Particularly vulnerable are service providers in the financial, administrative and juridical sectors. At the municipal level, particularly in Amsterdam, the private sector is engaged in countering vulnerabilities to organized crime. Business crimes may be handled at any level, but severe corporate crimes are dealt with on the national level. Money laundering is a big issue in the Netherlands. Significant investigations regarding money laundering and organized crime have been reported. Money laundering is prosecuted by the Dutch Public Prosecution Service, which has the power to forfeit and confiscate objects, including the proceeds of crime.","text - civil society and social protection":"In the Netherlands, support for human trafficking victims is largely government funded but provided for by non-governmental organizations. The government is also active in expanding the rights of victims. Currently, potential victims are allowed to stay in the country for three-months, which gives them time to decide whether or not to assist law enforcement. During this time, victims from non-EU countries have access to specialized shelters. They are, however, not allowed to work. They are eligible for a B-8 temporary residence permit, if they decide to testify against their alleged trafficker, and the authorities decide to prosecute. If B-8 status is maintained for at least three years, or if their trafficker was convicted, victims have the right to permanent residency. Some non-governmental organizations have raised concerns that this process can be harmful to the victim. In regards to prevention, the Netherlands has no national prevention strategy against organized crime in place. Instead, the focus is on its efforts on national coordination via the various judicial and law enforcement branches and institutions of government. Meanwhile, in order to prevent organized crime, the police analyze and monitor the logistics of transnational organized crime to disrupt criminal efforts. There are also several research hubs in the country dedicated to studying organized crime. The media play a key role in sharing information from non-governmental organizations to the public, and thus provide a voice for state and non-state actors alike. Overall, the Netherlands has a high level of media freedom.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Amsterdam","GDP (current $US million)":"907050.86","Income group":"High income","Population":"17344874","Land Area (sq. km)":"41540","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"24.1","Freedom in the World Index":"98","Human Development Index":"0.94","Global Peace Index":"1.53","Democracy Index":"8.96","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"82","GDP per capita (current US$)":"52295","1":"4.69","1.1":"5.00","1.2":"4.38","2":"7.42"},{"Corresp":"129","ISO-3":"MKD","Country":"North Macedonia","ISO-2":"MK","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Central & Eastern Europe","Flag file":"mk.png","1.

Additionally, throughout the country, migrants and refugees travelling informally and\/or aided by smugglers are vulnerable to trafficking, particularly women and unaccompanied minors. Organized crime groups are becoming increasingly sophisticated and law enforcement often accept bribes to facilitate the criminal market. ##&& Moreover, North Macedonia is a significant route for migrant smuggling, and this has increased in recent years, especially along the border with Greece and Serbia. In 2018, Serbia adopted a visa-free policy for Iranian citizens which resulted in an increase of Iranians attempting to enter Greece from Serbia, transiting through North Macedonia with the assistance of smugglers. Smuggling has continued during the COVID-19 pandemic and the rights of irregular migrants have weakened due to the country\u2019s temporary derogation from the European Convention on Human Rights.","text - trade":"North Macedonia is a transit and destination country for illicit arms, albeit on a small scale. Arms are easily accessible due to the insurrection in 2001, and imported weapons usually enter through Kosovo and Albania. Workshops converting alarm weapons have been found in recent years and registered companies have been discovered selling firearms by falsifying documents to illegally export them. Arms trafficking in the country does not involve major organized crime groups and is often run by the Albanian minority in North Macedonia.","text - environment":"Although illegal logging is primarily performed by locals simply seeking an income, there is evidence of larger scale logging activities carried out by organized crime groups along the border with Kosovo and Albania, that use violence to defend their activities. While the government controls timber exports, corruption and enforcement issues facilitate the illegal practice. Fauna crime is even less pervasive in North Macedonia, and any illegal activity that does happen is mostly related to the poaching of endangered species such as the Balkan lynx, as well as illegal fishing, particularly in Lake Ohrid. Rare animals and parts are usually smuggled into other countries in Europe and Asia. Despite most mining in North Macedonia being performed by legal companies, the government lacks control over the market and there are high levels of corruption allowing for non-renewable resource crimes to continue. North Macedonia also has low penalties for environmental crime, making it attractive to criminal groups.","text - drugs":"North Macedonia is a minor source country for heroin and a key transit point for Afghan and Turkish heroin being moved through the Balkan route towards Europe. North Macedonian groups based in Veles, Stip and Kocani control the market. There is low domestic consumption of heroin, with related low levels of violence. North Macedonia is also a transit and, to some extent, a destination country, for cocaine. Cocaine arrives from Latin America through the Balkan route moving on towards Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece. Local groups involved in the cocaine market cooperate with Albanian criminal groups and prices have remained stable throughout the pandemic suggesting supply and demand has not been affected much. ##&& North Macedonia is a transit country for cannabis moved from Albania into Turkey, where demand for the drug is high. North Macedonia also has a large domestic market, and the trade is associated with some violence over control of trafficking routes. There have been attempts by Albanian criminal groups to join the North Macedonian cannabis market, but these have been unsuccessful due to police intervention. Supply chains do not seem to have been affected by the pandemic, but prices have risen due to increased demand and reduced workforce available for harvesting. Whereas most synthetic drugs are produced in Serbia, police are increasingly finding laboratories in North Macedonia. There appears to be cooperation between North Macedonian groups and Serbian and Albanian criminal groups. The local market for synthetic drugs is increasing.","text - criminal actors":"North Macedonia has a highly diverse and fractionalized population which is why mafia-style groups, characterized by their control over community life, have been unable to gain significant footholds. Nevertheless, influential mafia style groups have existed in the past, such as the Frankfurt Mafia, and the ethnic division in the country could catalyze their re-emergence in the future. Illicit markets in the country are instead dominated by loose criminal networks, operating both nationally and transnationally, many of which are formed along ethnic or familial lines. Although competition and subsequent violence among competing networks is less present than in other countries in the region, there has been an increase in murder and other forms of violence perpetrated by criminal networks in recent years. ##&& Collusion between state-embedded actors and criminal groups is high, and there appears to be a certain level of criminal capture of state institutions and powerful politicians. Several high-profile political figures have been implicated in corruption scandals and corruption contributed to the downfall of the government in 2017. There is a reasonably high level of foreign criminal actor collaboration in North Macedonian criminal markets, especially from bordering countries such as Serbia and Albania, as well as Turkey and Saudi Arabia.","text - leadership and governance":"Despite years of stagnation and corruption, the current government in North Macedonia has introduced a period of relative political stability and an improvement in democratic governance. The country has become a member of NATO and accession talks have started with the EU. The government has also begun to address the criminal capture of the state by gradually restoring appropriate checks and balances while increasing transparency. Despite starting with relatively poor levels of corruption and accountability, the new government has taken steps to increase transparency \u2212 for example, all ministers have to declare their spending. The government has published more data around its budget and efforts are under way to improve transparency in public institutions as well, however much work still needs to be done as corruption remains embedded in even at the highest levels of state administration. ##&& North Macedonia has ratified all relevant organized crime treaties, has recently become a NATO member and has cooperated well with Europol. On a bilateral level, North Macedonia has operations with both Albania and Greece which have resulted in numerous arrests in relation to drug trafficking. Participation in joint investigations and improvements in strategic information sharing need further development. North Macedonia\u2019s legislative framework for tackling organized crime and implementing strategies are broadly in line with EU standards. The 2017 national strategy for combating human trafficking and smuggling is the only national strategy being undertaken and has yet to prove its effectiveness. Furthermore, as a result of COVID-19 and North Macedonia\u2019s temporary derogation from the European Court for Human Rights, its people have become exposed and vulnerable to human rights violations.","text - criminal justice and security":"North Macedonia has the lowest rate of pre-trial detention in the region, suggesting good judicial capacity to process criminal cases. Despite the rarity of hard rulings for high level crimes, the ability of the special prosecutor\u2019s office to carry out its role suggests an improvement in this area. However, its reputation was tarnished by a high-profile scandal and the institution ceased to exist in early 2020. The judiciary has systemic and structural issues usually stemming from corruption, such as poor implementation of necessary legislation, political interference and a lack of adequate independent oversight. Within law enforcement, specialized units to combat specific areas of organized crime have been created, and the new government has been working to overcome the structural and operational shortcomings in tackling corruption and organized crime, but a legacy of corruption and inefficiency remains. The customs administration and financial police remain limited in their capacity to carry out their activities, undermining the efficiency of anti-organized crime measures. As a landlocked country, North Macedonia has relatively strong border control, but it nevertheless faces challenges to its territorial integrity, being on the Balkan smuggling route and with corrupt officials facilitating organized crime groups. North Macedonia\u2019s border legislation is largely aligned with the EU and appears relatively strong, but the border with Albania poses particular difficulties.","text - economic and financial environment":"Despite a relatively low risk of money laundering, improvements need to be made with the supervision of the non-banking financial sector and in providing the necessary resources to ensure successful implementation of legislation. Money laundering in North Macedonia is often linked to financial crimes such as tax evasion and smuggling and a small portion is connected to narcotics trafficking. The country\u2019s tools for freezing, handling and confiscating criminal assets are not adequate and the anti-money laundering legislation is not aligned with the EU acquis. ##&& Overall, North Macedonia performs extremely well globally with its ease of doing business, and foreign companies see it as a favourable country for investment. Transparency has improved under the current government and this has helped the business environment. However, significant weaknesses include poor contract enforcement and a large informal economy that affects the competitiveness of the formal private sector. All of these factors result in an impressive but somewhat fragile economy.","text - civil society and social protection":"Institutional support for victims and witnesses is poor and in need of serious improvement. The government has formed a working group to try to amend the law on witness protection and broader efforts by the administration to support victims are becoming visible. Despite the political goodwill, however, victim support is mainly provided by NGOs which receive financial support from foreign entities. There is little evidence to suggest the state is doing enough to establish mechanisms to prevent involvement in organized crime. The country\u2019s state commission for corruption prevention was not functional for a long period of time and has no investigative powers, and while the legislative framework is in line with the EU, lack of implementation hinders progress. Overall, organized crime prevention capacities in North Macedonia are weak. ##&& The country has made excellent progress on improving the media environment, and though physical attacks on journalists have decreased, there is still a tendency of online abuse towards the media. There is no repression of civil society from the new government, however the number of organizations working on issues related to organized crime is relatively low.

The number of human trafficking victims in Norway has been steadily increasing since 2007. Reports suggest that perpetrators are usually either Norwegian or share the nationality of the victims. They are part of a loose organized crime structure, typically based on family or ethnic affiliations with potential ties to organized crime groups abroad. Human trafficking may occur in combination with document forgery, social security fraud, money laundering or the exploitation of victims of other crimes, such as drug production. It is estimated that most of the revenue from human trafficking in Norway is yielded by prostitution and forced labour in the construction sector. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic established strong restrictions in terms of the freedom of movement and border controls, which seems to have reduced the frequency of human trafficking incidents. ##&& Norway is a destination and transit country within the human smuggling trade. It is primarily a destination for human smuggling due to its image and reputation internationally as a place of safety and public goods. As with human trafficking, small groups or individuals of similar ethnicities with ties abroad dominate this market. There is a high likelihood that perpetrators will increasingly abuse technological means to conceal their identity and lower risks by forging, selling and buying false documents online. Exploitation such as false parenting or forced marriage, as well as false allegations of being victims of human trafficking, are some strategies used by smuggling networks in the country.","text - trade":"It is suggested that Norway is both its own source and destination country for arms trafficking, as a large proportion of the weapons found in circulation appear to originate from within the country. However, information surrounding the illicit arms market in Norway is, for the most part, limited. The country\u2019s military and police have received criticism for their substandard procedures for decommissioning firearms. Motorcycle gangs in the country are suspected of robbing military weapon caches in Norway and Sweden in collaboration with Balkan-based networks. It also appears that the main handlers of illegal weapons are private collectors. Another source is the dark web, which instructs customers how to assemble firearms at home.","text - environment":"Crimes related to fauna do occur in Norway, though it remains uncertain to what extent they are perpetrated by organized crime groups. The smuggling of wildlife into Norway is facilitated through its extensive land borders. The country\u2019s reptile trade ban appears to have spurred the emergence of a black market. Furthermore, Norway is the world's largest exporter of farmed salmon and significant volumes of farmed fish escape each year. Though this crime may not be linked to organized crime, other parts of the fishing industry may be. Illegal wolf hunting also occurs, albeit to a limited degree. Similarly, there is minimal information on non-renewable resource crimes in Norway, however, occasional incidents have been recorded. \u2018Unconscious smuggling\u2019 may also occur across the border between Norway and Sweden, a process in which people trade goods including alcohol, gasoline, food products, gemstones and more, without realising they are committing a crime. There is no significant evidence of a significant flora crimes market in Norway, although information suggests that protected plant species are being imported in the country.","text - drugs":"Cannabis is the most commonly seized illegal substance in Norway, with organized crime increasingly focused on its production and distribution efforts. Norway is primarily a destination country for cannabis brought in via the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Poland. Reports suggest that mafia-style groups and ethnic gangs control smuggling into Norway, and the distribution of the drug within the country. Despite the legalization of medical marijuana, cannabis continues to be highly valuable as a smuggled good to organized crime groups in Norway. It is likely that Norway is both a source and destination country for synthetic drugs. Amphetamines are thought to arrive by way of Germany, Poland and Sweden, with most of the MDMA being transported from the Netherlands. With regards to domestic production and trade, the import of chemicals used to make synthetics has significantly increased, partly due to the ease by which these can be obtained online. Foreign actors play a key role in the production and trafficking of synthetic drugs and their precursor chemicals. ##&& Norway is largely a destination country for heroin sourced from West Africa, Morocco, Poland, Lithuania and the Balkans. Heroin trafficking in Norway is carried out by smaller organized crime groups and individuals, often with ties in origin and transit countries. Mafia-style groups retain a significant share in the market. Norway is primarily a destination country for cocaine, with the drug entering Norway through other European countries, often from South American countries and the Netherlands. There has been some increase in the use and importation of cocaine in Norway as criminal networks cease the trade of synthetic drugs in favour of cocaine. Although major gangs are presumed to control the market, many smaller entrepreneurs and dealers are active. Smugglers and international actors are known to cooperate with local groups.","text - criminal actors":"Most organized crime in Norway is carried out by loose criminal networks, many of which are long-standing and generational, homegrown networks. Motorcycle gangs have little influence on the Norwegian society or state, and they have no interest in dominating territory or the political arena. Overall, most biker groups have grown old and tired, but some members are still criminally active. The most notorious mafia-style groups in Norway are based in Oslo, with affiliates across the country. The groups consist of criminals who engage mostly in drug-related crimes, violence and extortion. Since gangs in Norway are in different areas, they are said to be quite territorial and protective. However, no criminal enclaves are present and are usually limited to residential areas in the suburbs. Many use legal business structures to launder money. ##&& Foreign actors play a principal role in organized crime in Norway. Historically, the most notorious criminal groups in Norway have been based in Oslo, with affiliates across the country who tend to be connected to groups with different ethnic backgrounds. Certain criminal markets tend to be more connected to specific ethnic groups. In general, organized crime in Norway does not involve corrupt police, customs, or political officials. Furthermore, there are minimal records of any state-embedded actors involved in such activities.","text - leadership and governance":"The Norwegian government has taken a strong public stance against organized crime. However, political parties approach it from different perspectives, with some taking the economic angle, and others focusing on immigration. The government\u2019s approach involves close collaboration with law enforcement agencies. While the government has received criticism for its slow response to organized crime, the overall apparatus appears effective. Furthermore, the level of corruption in Norway is perceived to be fairly low. The government has put in place a data-protection authority that serves as a watchdog. Governmental agencies and the cabinet also maintain publicly available websites that are frequently updated for budgets, contracts, policy proposals and meeting minutes. Nevertheless, there have been a few cases of corruption, especially at the municipal level. ##&& At the international level, Norway is considered to be a trusted partner in the fight against organized crime and is among the major global financial contributors to this work. Norway has supported the development of key initiatives in the field of justice against human trafficking, corruption, terror and piracy. Moreover, it actively provides financial support to numerous bilateral programmes researching organized crime. Additionally, the Norwegian police cooperate with other Nordic police forces. Domestically, Norway has a national legal framework against organized crime, which guides authorities in the definition of what constitutes organized crime and the criminal justice process itself. The current criminal law stipulates two penal provisions that directly target participation in criminal organizations.","text - criminal justice and security":"Norway\u2019s judicial system is characterized by high levels of public trust. Overall, the Norwegian judiciary is well resourced by the state and able to make effective decisions across the board. Norway does not have a constitutional court, nor does it have a special court for different forms of organized crime. The state exercises firm control over the country\u2019s prison system, where a third of prisoners are foreign nationals. This is probably due to Norway applying significantly harsher penalties against crimes involving drugs. Generally, the country\u2019s prison standards are known to be among the best in the world. ##&& In terms of law enforcement, the Norwegian government follows a number of priorities to fight organized crime. This includes making ongoing assessments of criminal law so that it remains an appropriate and effective instrument, developing and strengthening interaction across police district boundaries, and strengthening the role of the national coordination body. A multi-agency approach is used in policing organized crimes and cooperation is often supported between municipalities, tax authorities, the welfare system and local criminal preventive councils. The police also have specialized human trafficking units in the five largest cities. With regards to territorial integrity, most organized crime occurs across Norway\u2019s land borders with Sweden and Finland. Given the borders\u2019 length, as well as the surrounding landscape, they are difficult routes to control. Nevertheless, there are several permanent customs offices and checkpoints along these borders. Additionally, there is effective collaboration between Norwegian and Swedish border agencies, as well as surveillance cameras at all crossings.

This is further enabled by a large state sector that can fund these institutions without disrupting economic stability, leaving space for entrepreneurial projects. The Norwegian business life is thoroughly regulated. Norway has a rather limited black or hidden economy compared to other nations. Furthermore, the country has comprehensive anti-money laundering measures and actively participates in international anti-money laundering initiatives. Overall, these measures constitute one of the main strategic priorities of the Norwegian government\u2019s efforts to tackle organized crime.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim and witness support form a significant part of the government\u2019s strategy against organized crime. These support programmes are political and private-sector initiatives, where businesses, police, volunteers and civil society all play a role. With regards to prevention, Norway focuses on the local level. There are, for example, crime prevention councils in each municipality collaborating with the local police to identify and implement strategies tailored to the local environment. The government is also creating collaborative forums, with resources being spent, both domestically and internationally, on research about organized crime and its impact on Norway and the world. Overall, civil society organizations\u2019 efforts appear to be focused on the local environment, in such a way that they are tailored to the prevalent conditions in certain municipalities, rather than the country as a whole.

Criminal groups from Africa also play a significant role in cocaine trafficking.","text - criminal actors":"There are currently no mafia-style groups in Poland, with the most famous ones having been dissolved in the first decade of the 2000s. However, older members of these groups are reportedly trying to get back into illicit activities. There are currently several organized crime groups operating in the country, consisting of a mix of local and foreign leaders and members. Criminal networks participate mostly in drug-related crimes and economic offences. Depending on their field, they rely on the darknet and social media platforms for anonymity. Most networks are widespread and very few groups exercise violence. In the last few years, the participation of football hooligans in organized crime groups has been noted. ##&& Most foreign criminal actors are involved in the trade of narcotics and human trafficking. Some Russian criminals operating in Poland are linked to their group headquarters back home. Criminal diasporas run local organized crime operations but are equally involved in international criminal activities. There is no confirmed information about the participation of state-embedded actors in such groups. However, some reports on this subject have suggested links between police corruption and organized crime.","text - leadership and governance":"The Polish government has expressed its intention to fight organized crime, and all political parties have declared it important. However, in practice, organized crime is not a priority. The government\u2019s central anti-corruption office (CBA) has been working to combat public and economic corruption through cooperation with international organizations and the relevant authorities in other countries. Alongside the CBA, the internal security agency has been monitoring public procurement and working on the realization of the government's 2014\u20132019 strategy to combat corruption. ##&& Poland has signed various international agreements and protocols targeting organized crime. As a member of the EU, Poland participates in the implementation of its policies on counteracting and combating crime. Poland has extradition agreements with several countries and a number of bilateral cooperation agreements in the fight against organized crime. Polish law criminalizes acts of organized crime, including drug offences, the obstruction of justice, participation in organized crime groups, the smuggling of migrants, illegal trade in cultural property, and human trafficking. The country has a strategy for the development of better state security by 2022, as well as a national plan to fight corruption, economic crime, and drug and human trafficking.","text - criminal justice and security":"Poland's justice system includes a supreme court, common courts, administrative courts and military courts, all of which are able to pass judgment against organized crime. Penalties and prison sentences are imposed effectively. The media reports on irregularities in law enforcement, and the government is in favour of strengthening laws aimed at preventing corruption in the judiciary. Until 2016, corruption was not common in Polish courts. The EU has noted that the treatment of prisoners in Poland is not in line with its policies or even with international human rights standards. There are also reports of drug distribution in prisons. The national police force cooperates with the military police and information services in the fight against organized crime. The national prosecutor's office has a special department for organized crime and corruption. The activities undertaken by the Polish police force's central bureau of investigation are aimed at combating organized crime of a cross-border nature and related to terrorist acts. Nevertheless, effectiveness in countering specific organized crime activities, such as human trafficking, is lacking. ##&& Because of its location on the eastern border of the EU, many products, especially tobacco and cigarettes, are smuggled into, through and out of Poland. Despite this, the country sees no challenges to its territorial integrity. The Polish border guard is a well-organized and well-functioning institution.","text - economic and financial environment":"Poland recently amended its anti-money laundering laws so that they are aligned to EU legal regulations, and overall, there has been a decline in the country's shadow economy. Nevertheless, the grey market continues to flourish in some sectors, such as the short-term apartment rental market. Poland has several institutions that counteract money laundering and the financing of terrorism. At the centre is the General Inspector of Financial Information, which can block accounts and withhold transactions, as well as investigate suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing.","text - civil society and social protection":"In 2018, the Polish government approved a programme for assistance to crime victims, to be rolled out from 2019 to 2021. This programme has introduced uniform standards of assistance for the victims and witnesses of crime. The country has a number of strategies in place to prevent drug crimes, economic crimes, corruption and human trafficking. Despite this, there is a lack of evaluation of their effectiveness. Whistle-blower policies are still not finalized and in use. ##&& Various non-governmental and international organizations offer support and protection for the witnesses and victims of organized crime. Civil society organizations play an important role in exposing political irregularities. Media independence plays a significant role in the uncovering of organized crime.

Reports have suggested that Portugal is also becoming part of a route for the trafficking of victims from African countries by sub-Saharan African criminal networks. Labour exploitation is the most common form of trafficking identified by the authorities. However, there have been incidents of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and forced begging. Recruiters and exploiters include both domestic and foreign actors. ##&& Portugal is a source, transit and destination country for human smuggling. Agriculture and hospitality are the most common sectors that employ irregular migrants in Portugal. Smuggling often involves criminal networks with links to corporate companies. There have also been cases where human smuggling involved the participation of state actors, including border police, but these are the exception rather than the norm.","text - trade":"Portugal is a transit country for firearms trafficked into Africa. Firearms conversion is a popular mechanism for acquiring illicit weapons in the country and their importation into Portugal is increasing. The dark web is used to circulate illegal weapons, especially those that are already on the black market. The dark web is also used to divert weapons that are legally owned. The participation of state actors in the criminal market of arms trafficking is quite common, along with mafia-style groups.","text - environment":"Flora crimes in Portugal are not particularly pervasive, but Portugal is, nevertheless, one of the lead destination countries in Europe for protected species of flora trafficked from Brazil. Portugal is also a destination country for illegally-logged timber from Democratic Republic of Congo. Similarly, the fauna crimes market is also fairly limited in the country, but Portugal is known to play a role as a transit and destination country for trafficked exotic fauna species. Due to its geographic position, colonial links and weak law enforcement, Portugal is a well-known entry point for bird smuggling from Latin America, mainly supplying markets in Western Europe and, to a lesser extent, Africa. Glass eel trafficking is also an issue in Portugal and involves highly organized crime networks. Lastly, Portugal is a minor transit and destination country for the non-renewable resources criminal market, where diamonds and emeralds have been seized. Often these gems are brought to Portugal via commercial flights from Africa, and then cut and shipped to Belgium.","text - drugs":"Portugal is a transit and destination country for cocaine trafficking. In 2018, cocaine was the most trafficked drug in the country. Most of the cocaine seized in Portugal comes from Latin America and the Caribbean and is distributed internally or trafficked to other European countries. The cocaine criminal market is transnational in nature, as cocaine is not produced internally. However, domestic state actors and mafia-style groups are also involved in the trafficking of cocaine. Furthermore, authorities have expressed concern about the increased use of the dark net for the trade. Portugal is a source country for cannabis herb, with most of the cannabis destined for other parts of Europe, Brazil and Guinea Bissau. The cannabis resin is trafficked in from other countries, particularly Morocco. In 2018, cannabis was the second most commonly seized drug. Most criminal actors involved in the cannabis trade are transnational. However, domestic networks were also involved, but only in relation to the trafficking of cannabis herb. In addition, there is also evidence of state actors participating in this trade. Although domestic production appears to be continuing despite the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a decrease in availability and an increase in price. ##&& Portugal is both a key transit and destination country for synthetic drugs. MDMA\/Ecstasy is considered to be the second most used drug in Portugal. The drugs are generally trafficked into the country from the Netherlands, followed by Spain, Belgium and France. Mafia-style groups are involved in the internal distribution of methamphetamines. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media largely replaced street markets in the trafficking of illegal synthetic drugs. Portugal is both a transit and destination country for heroin trafficking. Portuguese authorities have stressed that heroin trafficking has been gaining relevance. At the same time, heroin was the least trafficked drug in Portugal in 2018. Most of the heroin seized in Portugal comes from Spain and Mozambique and is then sold internally or trafficked to Europe. Most of the heroin seized was transported by land, followed by air. Transnational networks are the most common criminal actors involved in the heroin trade in Portugal. However, internal distribution is done by small groups of organized criminals with family links. The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced shipments of heroin, at least temporarily, because of travel restrictions.","text - criminal actors":"Overall, organized crime is not considered to be a major issue in Portugal. However, some specific organized mafia-style groups have been identified as operating at the domestic level, such as the Hells Angels and Los Bandidos, which have been in conflict with each other over territorial disputes. These groups are involved in homicide, extortion, theft, drug trafficking and the illegal possession and trafficking of weapons and ammunition. There is evidence of the presence of loose criminal networks in Portugal. Often these networks comprise small groups linked by family ties, and are involved in internal drug trafficking, particularly cannabis. Criminal networks are also involved in labour exploitation, mainly in rural areas of the district of Beja. In cases of sexual exploitation, the crimes are concentrated in urban centres, such as Faro and Lisbon. The criminal networks operating in Portugal often establish working relationships with foreign networks, that are responsible for producing and transporting drugs, or for recruiting and transporting victims, to Portugal. ##&& There are various foreign criminal groups in Portugal that are involved in theft, general violence and homicide. In recent years, there is also evidence of foreign involvement in the cocaine trade from South America, as well as human trafficking from Eastern Europe. In addition, foreign actors have reportedly moved and laundered criminal proceeds into Portugal from Spain and the USA due to increased law enforcement pressure in the latter two countries. Cases concerning state-embedded actors typically relate to situations where government officials facilitate crimes through inaction. Most notable is the use of Portugal\u2019s Golden Visa scheme, which provides a gateway for corrupt individuals and corporations to enter Europe and allows for money laundering and tax evasion. There have also been cases where state actors are involved in human smuggling, narcotics trafficking and arms trafficking.","text - leadership and governance":"While the international community does not consider organized crime in Portugal a major issue, it is one of the main priorities of the Portuguese government. This situation is reflected in the countries' national policies, where organized crime is considered a priority in terms of preventive and investigative actions. In addition, their position against organized crime is well reflected in the media, which regularly reports on successful operations tackling organized crime groups and their illegal activities. The majority of cases of corruption related to organized crime are sporadic. The only evidence of systemic corruption was an instance of fraud and money laundering as far back as 2014, which involved high-ranking state officials, including the prime minister at the time. There are limited mechanisms in place in Portugal to stop state corruption. Additionally, public perception on corruption includes skepticism about public officials and the police. Nevertheless, corruption perception in the country is comparably low. ##&& On the international level, Portugal has ratified all international legal instruments relevant to organized crime. There is also evidence that Portugal has been complying with most measures established by these international treaties. The only significant breach related to the implementation of international instruments in Portugal seems to be associated with the issue of corruption. Portugal has been taking important and constructive steps in terms of international cooperation, which include the establishment of successful joint operations between the Portuguese and foreign law enforcement authorities on issues of organized crime, as well as several other partnerships established between Portugal and other European and non-European countries related to human trafficking. On the domestic level, the national legal framework is in line with all international treaties on organized crime. The country has legal provisions criminalizing human trafficking, drug trafficking, human smuggling, arms trafficking, fauna, flora and non-renewable resource crimes. However, there is some evidence that legal loopholes exist in the national legal framework.","text - criminal justice and security":"Portugal has a specific department in the judicial system that executes the prosecution of violent and organized crime. Its efficiency, however, has come under scrutiny over the past couple of years because of the small number of cases investigated. In terms of the prison system, there has been recent evidence of organized criminal activities inside high security prisons. The country has a law enforcement agency responsible for conducting investigations related to organized crime. Additionally, cases relating to human trafficking are under the jurisdiction of another police body, which is also responsible for the investigation of the crimes of aiding illegal migration, such as human smuggling. Although it is difficult to gauge public trust in law enforcement, several media outlets have featured successful investigations and arrests related to organized crime groups and activities. Furthermore, various government reports have been released that contain information on the specific actions taken by law enforcement agencies to counter different criminal markets. With Portugal\u2019s considerable coastline, its geographic location and historical ties with South America, it is especially vulnerable to transnational organized crime. Portugal\u2019s Golden Visa scheme has also been identified as a potential threat to the country\u2019s territorial integrity.","text - economic and financial environment":"Portugal has several provisions to prevent criminal activities in business. Although regulatory frameworks exist at the legislative level, they are not always respected. Labour exploitation is indeed the most common transgression identified in Portugal. Some sectors of the economy also seem to be under the influence of organized crime groups, particularly the private security market and the agriculture sector. There are also several entities responsible for investigating regulatory infractions associated with money laundering. Despite this, there have been cases of money laundering activities reported within the country that involved not only criminal actors, but also high-ranking state officials. Reportedly, foreign actors have since recently began moving and laundering criminal proceeds in the country from Spain and the USA due to increased law enforcement pressures in the latter two.","text - civil society and social protection":"Most preventive initiatives in Portugal are related to human trafficking and drug trafficking. The only preventive strategies adopted in relation to flora and fauna crimes are the inspections carried out by competent authorities. Victims of drug trafficking are mostly assisted by the state, while non-state actors that are partially financed by the state, largely support victims of human trafficking. These victims are often provided with accommodation, psychological assistance, legal assistance, training\/education and repatriation assistance. However, the limited capacity of shelters in general, and for male victims in particular, does not meet current needs. Press and media freedom is largely enjoyed in Portugal, as journalists are permitted to publish what they want, without fear of retribution.

Criminal groups smuggle migrants from Ukraine into and through Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. A few migrants are smuggled from Turkey across the Black Sea into Romania and Bulgaria, from where they move north into Western Europe. With the recent tightening of the Serbia-Hungary border, there has been some displacement of human smuggling. Reportedly, smugglers now move people from Serbia through Romania and into Hungary. Other human-smuggling routes include organized crime groups consisting of Romanian and Indian nationals recruiting and smuggling Indian nationals from Romania to Italy, Germany and Portugal via land borders.

The trafficking of firearms to Romania from Western and Southern European countries also still takes place. Bulgaria is the main source country for Romania's illicit firearms. Albanian-speaking organized crime groups traffic weapons in Romania, along with Balkan, Russian, Georgian and Turkish criminal groups. Many firearms that end up on Romania's illegal gun market are illegally produced and\/or trafficked. Guns are also diverted from the legal domestic market. In organized crime group transactions, firearms are exchanged for other, more high-priced goods and products.","text - environment":"Illegal logging takes place on a large scale in Romania.

Romania is an important destination, transit and source country for wildlife trafficking. Traffickers allegedly use Romania's border with Ukraine to smuggle illicit wildlife into the EU. Romania is one of the few countries in Europe with a viable wildlife sturgeon population and thus has one of the most highly valued sturgeon caviar black markets in the world. ##&& Organized crime groups are involved in non-renewable resource crimes in Romania, including metal theft, illegal gold mining and oil smuggling. Metal theft in other European countries has also been linked to Romanian crime groups, as has the theft of valuable objects that are then melted down for their gold and silver.","text - drugs":"Romania forms part of the north Balkan route used for heroin produced in Afghanistan.

Joining the EU in 2007 created further opportunities for organized crime groups in Romania, especially with regard to VAT fraud. Poorly trained officials and a lack of cooperation between the public and private sector have hindered the country's efforts at tackling organized crime, but state fragility and vulnerability is diminishing. In spite of Romania having a relatively low corruption perception rating, the EU Commission has recorded serious flaws in the new government's response to tackling corruption. These include a bill that decriminalizes the abuse of power, the adoption of legislative changes to the judicial system with minimal or no consultation, and the subjection of judges and prosecutors to political attacks. However, the president\u2019s election campaign in 2019 included a commitment to install chief prosecutors who would focus on tackling endemic corruption. ##&& Romania has signed several international agreements related to organized crime. It participates in investigations stemming from EU judicial cooperation and has extradition treaties with a handful of other countries.

There are no private prisons in Romania, and the country is regularly condemned for its inadequate detention facilities and inhumane treatment of prisoners. Pre-trial detentions are common, and their length is still well above the European average. ##&& With regard to territorial integrity, most crimes detected by Romania's border police take place on its border with Moldova. Romania is an EU member state but not part of the Schengen zone, and there are therefore risks associated with its borders with Ukraine and Moldova, both of which experience fragility and higher levels of organized crime.

The government has a framework in place to provide support to victims of modern-day slavery and to help them exit from it. Romania provides outpatient treatment for drug users through a national network of drug prevention, evaluation and counselling centres. The country's preventive approach aims to raise public awareness and reduce demand, as well as to reduce the vulnerability of target groups, enhance their capacity to protect themselves and promote relevant hotlines through which people can report their suspicions and\/or receive support.

Motorcycle groups armed with axes and chainsaws are also complicit actors within the wider supply chain. Russia is a source, destination and transit country for the illicit wildlife trade. Whereas tigers, bears, wolves and other wildlife parts and products are trafficked from Russia to China, other exotic species are trafficked into Russia to supply a growing domestic demand. Poaching, as well as illegal fishing activity, is rampant across the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Far East and the Dagestan, Volgograd and Astrakhan regions of Russia. This includes unauthorized sturgeon fishing for caviar. Organized criminal groups have established extensive networks and distribution channels for the illegal wildlife market and forged ties with corrupt elements within environmental and law enforcement agencies. Reports indicate that rural residents, who are often amateur hunters, are also involved in illicit poaching crimes. ##&& As a country rich in natural resources, Russia is vulnerable to many non-renewable resource crimes. The exploitation of non-renewable resources, such as gold, diamonds, coal and non-ferrous metals, is largely in the hands of front companies owned by corrupt officials and organized crime groups, often working in partnership. In the Russian Far East, Chinese organized crime groups are also active in the Maritime Territory and Khabarovsk region, from where they smuggle black earth. At the same time, state-affiliated corporations now largely control oil and gas, with little scope for organized crime involvement. Most illicit activities surrounding non-renewable resources in Russia involve corrupt state contracts. Top actors in this criminal market also feature a complex entanglement of family and friendship connections that can be traced to the highest levels of government.","text - drugs":"Russia is a key transit and destination country for heroin. A third of the global turnover of heroin passes through Russia. It is largely sourced from Afghanistan, and enters the country through Central Asia or the South Caucasus. The role of the South Caucasus trafficking corridor is growing. Major seizures in 2019 also indicate that the drug is sometimes transported through Russia via Belarus and Poland to Western Europe. Wholesale bulk lots of heroin are smuggled into the country by international criminal groups, namely large drug syndicates with rigid hierarchies. Notably, criminal networks, with the participation of Turkish nationals, are involved in the heroin trade from Afghanistan to Western Europe via Russia. Synthetic drugs as well as the ingredients are sourced from South-eastern Asia and China, with drugs then manufactured in local laboratories in Russia. Methamphetamine is smuggled from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the Baltic States, China, Iran, Belarus and Ukraine. Demand for synthetic drugs in Russia has increased steadily, in particular Ecstasy, sourced primarily from the Netherlands and Poland, which is a popular party drug in Russia. ##&& Russia\u2019s synthetic drugs market is second only to cannabis and its supply chain accommodates both local and foreign criminal actors, although street-level distribution is essentially still in the hands of domestic gangs. Market actors largely prey on teenagers and young people, who are also the majority of users. Russia is also a destination and source country for cannabis. Some is grown domestically but most of it comes from the Middle East and North Africa, often by sea. Criminal networks are involved in its distribution. The distributors are usually teenagers or young people looking to make a quick profit. There is also considerable demand for cannabis among Central Asian migrants. The illicit cannabis trade has moved online to protect the anonymity of suppliers and clients. Cocaine consumption in Russia is on the rise, especially among young people. Demand for the drug is largely concentrated in Moscow, Sochi, Kazan and Saint Petersburg. Cocaine is largely smuggled from South America with intermediate stops in Europe or Africa. Russian organized crime groups smuggle it by air or land. These groups are also engaged in swapping Afghan heroin for Latin American cocaine, largely for re-trafficking to Europe, and to a much lesser extent, Asia. Previously, cocaine trafficking was largely through the dark web. However, analysis of recent transactions reveals a decline in virtual sales, most likely replaced by conventional dealers.","text - criminal actors":"Russia has a complex and varied ecosystem of criminal actors. There are eight to 12 major nationwide networks, and each small group within the network controls a specific segment of the illicit supply chain, for example, drug transportation or distribution. Most networks emerged from mafia-style gangs that expanded by incorporating other groups and, as they extended across regional and national borders, had to adapt to a more decentralized and flexible form of organization. These mafia-style groups are confined to particular cities or regions. Many groups engage in protection racketeering. And although extortion still takes place, it occurs at a much lower rate than in the past. Instead, kickbacks and the seizure of assets through fake documentation and spurious legal claims are on the rise. Mafia-style groups also tend to be involved in a wide range of other illegal markets, from drug trafficking and distribution, to counterfeiting and modern slavery. There have been isolated instances where Russian-based organized crime groups in Europe have been used as covert instruments of the Kremlin. Overall, levels of overt violence have fallen dramatically since the 1990s and traditional criminal actors have lost much of their prior status. ##&& Several organized criminal groups in the country were formed on an ethnic basis. Some are very loose networks, defined by common interest or culture. Others are anchored to individuals or a specific territorial area. By and large, foreign actors exert substantial financial power across all criminal markets, and are concentrated particularly in Russia\u2019s Far East, but also on the borders with Moldova and the Baltic states. Some elected Russian officials have been found guilty of associating with organized crime groups or those with criminal records. In some cases, they form organized and persistent criminal enterprises, which engage in a range of criminal activities and are largely dependent on their specific positions in government. As a result, gangs within the security agencies are particularly powerful. Virtually every major illicit market is controlled by mid to high-level members of the security forces, under the tacit supervision and control of higher-level political elites, both at the local and federal level. Additionally, the state deals with large and violent criminal groups by allowing some crime bosses to operate, both on the black market and in legitimate businesses, on the condition of not drawing public attention through violence. Many past criminal leaders went into legitimate business or politics in the period following the fall of the Soviet Union, and those who still try to operate independently are typically outgunned by the law enforcement protection racket.","text - leadership and governance":"Although the government frequently asserts that combating organized crime is a national priority, it is rarely reflected in its actions. Ties to criminal entities are also present in the multiple foreign conflicts that Russia is currently engaged in. Furthermore, corruption is both rampant and systemic. Although corruption has declined at the lower levels of the state apparatus, it remains widespread at the higher levels. Nevertheless, anti-corruption has been identified as a top state priority, which, in recent years, has brought more attention to the work of prosecutors. This has also led to a new emphasis on cooperation between various government agencies. Although the federal budget is published annually and there are mechanisms in place to access government information, there are often no consequences for public officials if transgressions are identified. Meanwhile, accountability has been used as a political weapon by the Kremlin against its critics and by senior figures against their rivals. ##&& The Russian Federation is a signatory to nearly every relevant international organized crime treaty. Cooperation in fighting transnational crime covers the life and health of person, terrorism and terror financing, drug trafficking, arms trafficking, fraud and theft, money laundering, human trafficking and human smuggling. Nevertheless, the Russian government can also be obstructive in international cooperation, particularly when it comes to corruption cases involving high-ranking state officials and their assets abroad. On a national level, Russia\u2019s laws concerning the administration of criminal justice have been reformed several times following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Additionally, Russia\u2019s legal framework has been updated periodically, sometimes to address specific criminological concerns, revise confusions and contradictions, and also for political reasons.","text - criminal justice and security":"The Russian judiciary is a centralized structure, which is constitutionally independent. However, in practice, the judiciary is susceptible to high levels of executive interference and corruption in politically sensitive cases. The judiciary is regularly wielded as an instrument of the political elite. The prosecution of criminal offences in Russia falls under the remit of two separate legal bodies, including one that serves as the leading anti-corruption agency responsible for public and private corruption investigations and prosecutions. There have been numerous prosecutions of corrupt officials and organized crime figures, but senior figures still appear relatively untouchable unless a political decision has been made to pursue them. The prison system is under-resourced, overcrowded and subject to high levels of corruption, as well as sporadic violence. Organized crime leaders have sometimes found themselves isolated within high-security facilities but, more often, crime leaders enjoy minimal controls and have been able to continue running their criminal enterprises from behind bars. ##&& In terms of law enforcement, Russia has a sizeable apparatus with considerable resources. There has been notable positive change in reducing corruption in the police, particularly traffic police. Nevertheless, law enforcement is also wielded as an instrument of the state for political purposes. Another major impediment for effective work across all law enforcement agencies is excessive paperwork. In regards to its territorial integrity, many Russian border regions are sparsely populated, making physical control of them difficult. At the same time, Russia is an active trading country with extensive road, rail, air and sea connections across the world. The country is also located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. All of this, combined with a serious problem of corruption among border and customs officials, makes Russia an attractive hub for global criminal networks. Nevertheless, the state\u2019s ability to control land, air and sea borders is fairly robust, and there are few issues with regard to territorial control on the part of the state.","text - economic and financial environment":"Russia is assessed to have a high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. Criminal elements are known to use Russia\u2019s financial system for laundering money through various means, including virtual currencies, precious metals and real estate, among others. Although Russia has developed a relatively robust anti-money laundering\/countering financing of terrorism legal framework, weaknesses in the laws, banking supervision, and enforcement means that the country is both a consumer and supplier of money laundering services to organized crime groups. Anti-money laundering reforms of Russia\u2019s banking sector have reduced opportunities for domestic laundering, but the tools and regulations available on paper do not have much of a track record for being used in practice. Overall, Russia has an ongoing desire to create an economic regulatory environment that is conducive to doing business. However, as the regulatory capacity develops, it has become more vulnerable to exploitation because it provides new avenues for rent seeking. Furthermore, corruption and state support for its own companies, or those owned by senior allies, undermines and exploits this environment.","text - civil society and social protection":"Russia has laws that provide protection for victims, witnesses and other participants in criminal proceedings. Despite this, witness protection is undermined by corruption within the agencies responsible for its provision, and support for victims is often plagued by a lack of facilities, as well as the perception that protection is not a state responsibility. Charities and other non-governmental organizations, which attempt to supplement these shortcomings, are inadequate, and increasingly hobbled by laws controlling donations from abroad. Additionally, the government does not attempt to raise public awareness or change negative attitudes towards people who use drugs, or who are victims of human trafficking. Meanwhile, areas such as community outreach, social intervention and whistle-blowing continue to be neglected. ##&& The operating environment for non-state actors has been on a downward trend over the past several years. The state is strongly opposed to any non-governmental organizations, especially those that have links abroad. However, it is willing to support civil society, so long as it confines itself to specific issues and local politics. Civil society organizations have played a significant role in fighting organized crime, especially in designing their own initiatives among local communities. Government funding is the primary source of funding for these organizations, but existing legislation allows the state to also apply pressure on them. Russia\u2019s media freedom is extremely limited. Oppressive measures have been taken against the media, and more journalists are being imprisoned now than at any time since the fall of the Soviet Union. Physical attacks, including murder, against journalists are carried out with impunity.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Moscow","GDP (current $US million)":"1699876.58","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"144406261","Land Area (sq. km)":"17098250","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"73.6","Freedom in the World Index":"20","Human Development Index":"0.82","Global Peace Index":"3.05","Democracy Index":"3.31","Regime Type":"Authoritarian","Corruption Perceptions Index":"30","GDP per capita (current US$)":"11585","1":"6.24","1.1":"6.10","1.2":"6.38","2":"4.04"},{"Corresp":"146","ISO-3":"SMR","Country":"San Marino","ISO-2":"SM","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Southern Europe","Flag file":"sm.png","1.

According to the Sammarinese government, the country\u2019s small size, limited infrastructure and tiny population make it unattractive to criminal organizations associated with human trafficking. Nevertheless, trafficking is still believed to take place on a small scale, due to the country's proximity to the Romagna Riviera, an area affected by labour exploitation. ##&& Although San Marino belongs to the Mediterranean region, one of the most-transited in the world for human smuggling, the country is not near any major human smuggling routes. The barriers to human smuggling in San Marino, in addition to the country's small size, include its landlocked nature and the lack of major ports or railways.","text - trade":"There is limited evidence of arms trafficking in San Marino. However, there is data showing an increase in transactions for legal arms, which suggests a potential opportunity for a future criminal market. In 2013, an investigation was launched into a trafficker with important connections in San Marino who was supplying weapons to mafia groups in Italy.","text - environment":"There is minimal evidence of environmental crimes in San Marino. However, Sammarinese companies may be involved in non-renewable resource crimes in Italy.","text - drugs":"San Marino is a destination country for the cannabis trade. Profits from this market are generally passed from domestic to foreign actors, particularly Italian mafia-style groups. However, if the country legalizes cannabis at some point, the existing profit structure may change. San Marino is a destination country for small quantities of heroin. Due to its geographic location, profits go to foreign actors (mafia-style groups and\/or criminal networks) who have de facto control over Italy\u2019s drug trafficking markets. ##&& San Marino is also a possible destination country for a small cocaine market. Compared with the rest of the region, seizures tend to be insignificant \u2013 although there are indications that consumption may be higher than reflected by these seizures. In terms of the global synthetic drug market, San Marino is irrelevant. Even within the country, this market lags far behind other illicit drug markets.","text - criminal actors":"There is scant information on domestic mafia-style groups operating in San Marino. Rather, mafia-style groups operating in San Marino stem from foreign countries, most notably Italy. Most of these groups revolve around one boss or family, whose surname they are known by. They are often not based in San Marino, but have operatives in the country whose purpose is to launder money earned from criminal markets abroad. There is evidence to suggest that Russian and Chinese organized crime networks could play a bigger role in San Marino in the future. ##&& Because San Marino is used as a transit country for money laundering, loose organized crime groups and tax evaders have links to start-up businesses, investment funds and banks. There are allegations against state-embedded actors and investigations into the roles some politicians play in San Marino's criminal markets and their money-laundering operations.","text - leadership and governance":"San Marino's political leadership has not taken a firm stance against organized crime. It does not seem to be a topic for campaign rallies and political debates. While the country\u2019s democratic process and the transition of power is smooth, independent and protected from criminal activities, its political system is not entirely free of organized crime. There have been reports of links between high-profile politicians and organized-crime groups. While San Marino does not have an independent anti-corruption body, the Sammarinese authorities have taken steps towards fighting corruption. However, state bodies are still insufficiently scrutinised and the Council of Europe has called for increased access to public information with regards to the judiciary. ##&& San Marino has ratified a number of international treaties on organized crime; and, despite its small size, it has extradition agreements with several countries. One of the most important steps it has taken in the prevention of organized crime was the signing of a bilateral agreement with Italy in 2015. The agreement established a model of cooperation between the two countries, aimed at defending and preserving order and citizens\u2019 safety. It also advocated joint activities and reciprocal assistance as a multifaceted and holistic approach to fighting terrorism, human smuggling, money laundering, arms and drug trafficking, and cybercrime. ##&& On a national level, San Marino has very few laws that specifically criminalize organized crime related activities. While there are some provisions that deal with and regulate cases dealing with organized crime, the country's laws do not go into detail on the investigation, arrest, prosecution, adjudication and punishment of organized-crime groups.","text - criminal justice and security":"There are no specialized departments in the San Marino judiciary that deal with organized crime. However, the judicial system copes well with money laundering issues, and cooperates effectively with international authorities and other relevant bodies. Nevertheless, the judiciary appears vulnerable to political interference and accountability has been raised as an issue. The country has only one correctional prison facility, which is reportedly run according to high standards, with no evidence of corruption among prison personnel. ##&& While San Marino's law enforcement agencies include a unit that has jurisdiction to combat organized crime, corruption and money laundering, there is no evidence of a proper intelligence apparatus in the country. With regard to territorial integrity, San Marino's borders with Italy are porous. Although the country is close to major criminal markets, it is not particularly vulnerable to their activities because of its small size and lack of major infrastructure.","text - economic and financial environment":"No criminal activities apart from money laundering appear to be prevalent in San Marino, and there are no specific sectors of the economy that are controlled by organized crime groups. Its weak banking sector makes the country vulnerable to money laundering. In the last few years, the country has sought to improve its legislation and policies around anti-money laundering. It has also signed memorandums of understanding with several countries regarding this topic, as it has realized that money laundering poses a major threat to its economy. Nevertheless, attempts to reform its banking system have proven to be a major challenge for San Marino's economy, and there are still gaps in its legal system that are a cause for concern.","text - civil society and social protection":"There is no evidence of substantial victim- or witness-support programmes in San Marino. Because of its small population, historically low levels of violence and the quasi-absence of domestic organized crime groups, the country has not felt pressured to build a stronger support system. The implementation of new regulations for the prevention of organized crime (related to San Marino's bilateral agreement with Italy) is still at an early stage. Because organized crime is not particularly prevalent in the country, non-state actors do not play a big role in combating criminal activities. However, anti-mafia groups from the nearby Emilia-Romagna region of Italy have a presence in San Marino. ##&& There are several media outlets that cover financial crimes and the judiciary in San Marino, but there have been no reported attacks on journalists, media houses or civil society activists. However, San Marino has strict defamation laws, which threaten journalists with civil damages and fines.

Women and children are trafficked into neighbouring and EU countries for sexual exploitation and forced labour, and men are trafficked for forced labour, usually in the construction industry. There is a smaller domestic market for the sexual exploitation and forced labour of victims from countries such as Moldova and Russia. The number of formally identified trafficking victims has risen in recent years in Serbia. ##&& Serbia has been heavily exposed to the migrant crisis. This is due to its proximity to EU states and because it forms part of the Balkan migrant route \u2013 the main route running from south to north through Serbia and into Croatia. Although some border crossings are facilitated by smugglers, most irregular border crossings take place without criminal facilitation and there is no violence associated with this market.","text - trade":"Serbia is a hub of illicit firearms trafficking and is a major weapons producer, with large quantities of arms being diverted into the illegal market. Since the 2011 Arab Spring, the illicit firearms trade has become highly profitable and large quantities of firearms are trafficked to armed groups in Syria and conflict areas in the Middle East. Organized-criminal groups first smuggle arms into Central European states such as Croatia and Hungary, and then on to western states such as France and Belgium. Trafficking operations usually involve several politically well-connected individuals with links to organized crime groups. Mafia-style groups dominate the illicit firearms trade.","text - environment":"Most flora crimes, such as logging, occur in either privately owned forests where there is inadequate security, or in state-owned forests where theft is facilitated by corrupt forest rangers. There is poor state control of illegal logging, and corruption is widespread among the agencies and officials tasked with protecting forestry. The criminal networks involved in illegal logging are small and the market is not pervasive throughout Serbia. Illegal loggers usually come from Podujevo in Kosovo in special vehicles with the appropriate equipment to cut down trees quickly. There is an active fauna crimes market in Serbia, predominantly targeting bird species, resulting in some 200,000 birds being poached each year, usually by EU nationals. Serbia is also a destination country for exotic and illicit wildlife. Illegal fishing of sturgeon and sale of sturgeon caviar is also an issue in the country, albeit on a smaller scale compared to neighbouring Bulgaria and Romania. ##&& Fuel is the most commonly smuggled resource from Serbia and is usually destined for Kosovo. The illicit fuel trade occurs alongside a small oil-trafficking market. Illegal sand and gravel excavation along the Drina river has damaged ecosystems and polluted drinking water. The Serbian criminal groups involved in this market are usually also involved in the drug- and arms-trafficking markets.","text - drugs":"The heroin market is among the most pervasive and violent criminal markets in Serbia and involves several organized-crime groups. Serbia acts as a transit country, as local groups cooperate with foreign criminal networks to move heroin from Afghanistan into the Balkans. Serbia also has the highest number of heroin users in the Western Balkans. Serbia is a transit and destination country for cannabis, although there is evidence of increasing domestic cultivation. Cannabis from Albania and Turkey is trafficked into Serbia and moved predominantly into Central Europe. Due to the affordability of cannabis, there is a large market in Serbia, but there appears to be very little violence associated with it. ##&& Serbia is a source, transit and destination country for synthetic drugs and is the main source of synthetic drugs in the region. Synthetic drugs are produced in small quantities in hidden labs throughout Serbia and are mainly exported to Western Europe, neighbouring states and the Middle East. There is, however, a small but growing domestic market. Serbia is a transit and destination country for cocaine, with the dominant Serbian criminal groups collaborating with trafficking groups from Montenegro. However, the violence between rival Montenegrin groups often takes place in Serbia and there are ongoing assassinations. The growing demand and availability of cocaine suggest that the domestic market is growing.","text - criminal actors":"Overall, mafia-style groups in Serbia enjoy significant protection from political figures and prosecutors, as evidenced by the fact that no high-profile murder or drug-trafficking cases have been prosecuted. Serbian mafia groups are highly active internationally and are predominantly involved in the drug- and arms-trafficking markets. In Belgrade and Novi Sad, criminal networks are widespread and strongly interconnected, controlling various local criminal markets, and acting as satellite networks of the country\u2019s mafia-style groups. The networks use intimidation to maintain control of local communities, extorting businesses, controlling criminal markets and maintaining political links. ##&& There is a strong connection between criminal actors and politicians in Serbia, particularly in the media and in privatization and public procurement, which provides criminals with thorough protection. The country\u2019s political system and institutions, including its criminal-justice institutions, are dominated by the ruling party, with no effective oversight from an opposition. State-embedded actors are also heavily involved in white-collar organized crime. Montenegrin criminal actors, largely in the form of mafia-style groups, dominate the criminal economies, bringing much violence into Serbia. Russian criminal actors have a strong influence in the criminal world, due to the extent of Russia's political and economic penetration in the country; there is also a growing Turkish criminal influence, especially in the Sand\u017eak region.","text - leadership and governance":"Serbia has a powerful central government with authoritarian characteristics and concerning levels of criminal capture. Constitutional changes that form part of EU accession procedures are still to be adopted in areas such as political interference with the judiciary and other independent institutions. Despite moderate public confidence in the government, mass protests starting in November 2018 continued well into 2020, and corruption is perceived to be widespread throughout political institutions. There is a lack of transparency in the functioning of the government in Serbia and corruption is prevalent. There was a lack of political will and serious delays in adopting the legislation to create an anti-corruption agency, and law enforcement appears to be unable to investigate and prosecute high-level corruption cases independently. There is also a lack of effective oversight and independent regulatory bodies, as well as a lack of political will to raise standards. Although transparency is extremely low and worsening, Serbia remains one of the better performers in the region. ##&& Despite not being a member of NATO, Serbia has ratified necessary treaties and has cooperated well with international actors. However, most of the country\u2019s international relations are burdened by the issue of Kosovo\u2019s recognition. There is a substantial backlog of extradition demands, but this is mostly due to administrative delays rather than lack of political will. Overall, there is good cooperation with EUROPOL, which has led to a series of successful investigations, and Serbian courts engage in mutual legal assistance with courts of neighbouring states. Despite the adoption of a strategy around human trafficking and money laundering, this is yet to lead to any results. As with many countries in the region, although there are a significant number of organized-crime-related laws in place, enforcement remains ineffective.","text - criminal justice and security":"Law enforcement and judicial authorities are unable to investigate and prosecute high-level corruption cases independently despite the political influence the authoritarian government has over judicial proceedings and the security agencies. Some progress was registered in reducing the backlog of enforcement cases and adopting mechanisms to harmonise court practice; however, caseloads across the courts in the country continue to burden the judicial system. Similarly, law enforcement is not currently equipped to resist the undue political interference of the government in corruption cases. Frequent changes of leadership in investigative departments and widespread corrupt links to criminal networks also hamper investigation efforts. In addition, there is confusion between police and prosecution teams and a lack of institutional cooperation. ##&& Serbia is landlocked and has relatively good control over its borders, however, links between organized crime and law enforcement do facilitate cross-border crime. Although there is good cooperation between Serbia and the EU and there are joint controls with EU border police officers, the country\u2019s southern and western borders remain porous, and border facilities need significant resources to improve.","text - economic and financial environment":"Serbia has a fairly high risk of money laundering, despite improvements made in recent years. The government adopted a new law on anti-money laundering and terrorist financing; however, implementation has been poor and, as previously noted, law enforcement and the judiciary are unable to operate outside of political interference in money-laundering cases. There are strategic and systemic deficiencies in Serbia\u2019s response to money-laundering crimes, and the market often involves actors who are close to the political sphere. ##&& Serbia has mixed success with regard to the ease of doing business, performing well in areas such as starting a business, construction permits and ease of cross-border trade. However, access to credit could be improved, and the private sector is underdeveloped and faces structural deficiencies such as a weak rule of law, unfair competition and an overdeveloped shadow economy. Overall, Serbia has a developed economy but faces many structural issues.","text - civil society and social protection":"Regionally and globally, Serbia performs poorly with regard to protection for whistle-blowers and victims of modern slavery, including child victims. The poor implementation of both reforms and investment in victim support has not improved public trust in institutions tasked with supporting victims in Serbia. Moreover, judges in Serbia have not been consistent in assigning protected status and abstaining from penalizing witnesses and trafficking victims. Serbia broadly meets international standards in its corruption prevention mechanisms; however, they are yet to be fully implemented. High unemployment, political protection of criminals and a lack of successful high-level prosecutions do not create an ideal environment for preventing organized crime. ##&& Since 2016, attacks on the media have risen sharply, alongside increasingly inflammatory rhetoric used against journalists by government officials, resulting in a repressive media environment. However, Serbia has a strong civil society that fights robustly against organized crime, even in the face of hostility from the government. The government does not encourage civil-society organizations and has so far resisted putting in place any strategy to improve cooperation with, and effectiveness of, civil-society organizations.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Belgrade","GDP (current $US million)":"51475.02","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"6945235","Land Area (sq. km)":"88360","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"67.4","Freedom in the World Index":"64","Human Development Index":"0.81","Global Peace Index":"1.85","Democracy Index":"6.22","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"38","GDP per capita (current US$)":"7412","1":"6.22","1.1":"5.55","1.2":"6.88","2":"4.92"},{"Corresp":"154","ISO-3":"SVK","Country":"Slovakia","ISO-2":"SK","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Central & Eastern Europe","Flag file":"sk.png","1.

Human-trafficking victims come predominantly from the eastern part of Slovakia, where people are vulnerable targets due to a number of risk factors such as unemployment, homelessness and a lack of education. Human trafficking appears to be on the rise in Slovakia \u2013 evident, in particular, in the rising number of male victims. ##&& At the height of the European migrant crisis of 2015\u20132016, a significant number of people were smuggled from Syria into Slovakia through the Balkan route, but human smuggling has decreased since then. The people-smuggling market in Slovakia is linked largely to criminal networks and foreign actors. There are unverified reports of state-embedded actors being involved in document forging.","text - trade":"Slovakia has a long history of firearms production and involvement in the illegal-weapons trade. It is a source country for arms trafficked to other EU states. The detection of illegal shipments of weapons out of the country is difficult as certain exports are legal (although deemed contrary to Slovakia\u2019s international obligation not to supply weapons that may end up in the hands of militants). Since Slovakia adopted new regulations in 2015, the most popular arms sold in the country are firearms that have been modified to Flobert gun calibres \u2013 which can then easily be converted into more powerful, live-ammo weapons. The illegal conversion of these firearms generally takes place in other countries, such as Poland or Ukraine, before they are resold illegally on the European market. This low-level arms trafficking makes an important contribution to the income of those in the lower ranks of organized crime.","text - environment":"Slovakia is a destination and transit country for illegal trade in ornamental plants. Illegal logging is a growing problem, but for the most part it is not related to organized crime. Slovakia is a destination, source and transit country for illicit wildlife trafficking. It is also a source country for the smuggling of dogs. Poaching \u2013 especially of birds, bears and wolves \u2013 is a concern. ##&& There is not a significant criminal market for non-renewable resources in Slovakia. Nevertheless, criminal groups have been known to be involved in the illicit fuel trade. Coal has become an important resource on the illegal market, and there are cases of criminal groups importing coal from Ukraine without the proper documentation. There are also reports of amber being smuggled into the country from Ukraine.","text - drugs":"The smuggling of drugs is considered to be an important source of income for organized-crime groups in Slovakia, which is a transit and destination country for heroin coming from Afghanistan via the Balkan route. There are several gangs, especially from the Balkan countries, operating in the heroin market. Heroin use in Slovakia appears to be on the decline. Slovakia is a transit and destination country for cocaine. The cocaine trade involves organized groups (both local and foreign), as well as smaller groups of individuals who use cocaine. The majority of cocaine comes from the Netherlands or Belgium via contacts in South American countries. Cocaine use in Slovakia is increasing, especially among the young and wealthy. ##&& Cannabis is the most prevalent drug in Slovakia. Although its use for medical purposes as well as the use of low-THC cannabidiol (CBD) is legal in the country, cannabis possession is illegal and can carry a jail sentence. Cannabis is produced mostly for local consumption and is circulated largely without the involvement of organized-crime groups \u2013 although Vietnamese criminal groups have been known to be involved in production, while other groups have established special indoor-cultivation facilities. ##&& Slovakia is a destination and transit country for large shipments of synthetic drugs. There is a trend in the country for traditional illicit drugs to be replaced by cheaper synthetic drugs. However, the value of synthetic drugs is increasing due to their growing popularity as well as their reduced availability \u2013 a consequence of the law catching up and prohibiting newly invented substances. Most synthetic drugs come from the Netherlands and Poland. They are imported by drug smugglers or bought online and shipped via post. However, MDMA\/Ecstasy and methamphetamine are also produced domestically. Methamphetamine is the most common drug to be seized after cannabis and is the primary drug of concern for the Slovak authorities. Another emerging issue is the sale of new psychoactive substances under the general name of ecstasy or as a legal alternative to cocaine and methamphetamine.","text - criminal actors":"Mafia-style groups dominated Slovakia's criminal landscape in the past, but most of the groups from the mid-1990s are no longer functional. While their power has declined over the years, the heroin trade, in particular, still appears to be overshadowed by mafia-style groups, whereas human trafficking is operated by a mix of mafia-style groups and other criminal networks. There are also reports of corrupt officials inside the Slovak security and customs sectors with links to mafia-style groups. New criminal networks have emerged and gained power in recent years. They are involved in various forms of white-collar crime, economic crimes, corruption and the exploitation of state funds. Their activities include violent crimes and involve contact with high-level politicians, law-enforcement agencies and the courts. Apart from these criminal networks, there are also looser, less structured networks made up mostly of Slovak nationals who operate in the human-trafficking, arms-trafficking, synthetic-drugs and cannabis markets. ##&& There have been allegations of widespread corruption on various levels of the state apparatus, including at the highest level. Despite the current government proclaiming anti-corruption a central point on its agenda and campaigning on the issue, allegations of bribery continue to emerge. Many foreign criminal diasporas, including Hungarian, Vietnamese, Italian and Balkan groups operate in organized-crime markets within Slovakia, predominantly drug trafficking. Most of these groups have ties to illicit markets in their countries of origin. A common way for foreign criminal actors to establish a base in Slovakia is to set up a company with foreign capital and fictitiously employ foreign nationals.","text - leadership and governance":"Prior to 2020, the involvement of state-embedded actors in organized crime was ubiquitous. As a result, the government that took office in 2020 has been vocal in its opposition to grand corruption. There have been calls for reform in the justice system, law enforcement and other areas, as well as proposals for new anti-corruption and money-laundering legislation. While in practice access to information in Slovakia is poor, the legal framework guiding it allows for transparency. However, even though Slovakia publishes budget forecasts and has a public-procurement system, corruption is still reported as a major problem in the system. ##&& Slovak law-enforcement agencies cooperate well with international bodies on matters related to countering organized crime. Slovakia is a signatory to international and regional conventions on organized crime and cooperates closely with the other three Visegr\u00e1d 4 countries as well as with Europol. On a domestic level, Slovakia has up-to-date laws and national policies that adequately respond to threats of organized crime. However, there are still gaps in its legislation that are exploited by criminal groups \u2013 and these policies need to be applied in a more systematic, unbiased and professional manner by the country's law-enforcement agencies.","text - criminal justice and security":"Slovakia's judicial system is perceived to be one of its most problematic institutions, due mainly to corruption and how long it takes for cases to be tried, but the government apparently plans to adopt constitutional changes to improve the system. The justice ministry is responsible for the country\u2019s prison system \u2013 which, under the law, has operational independence, aimed at decreasing corrupt practices among prison security personnel. In spite of this, there have been some reports of abuse of inmates. Special law-enforcement units for combating organized crime exist, but they are considered relatively weak in investigating white-collar crime, corruption and high-level political crimes. Some high-ranking police officers are allegedly in close contact with criminal groups, who are able to manipulate investigations. ##&& Slovakia is vulnerable to transnational organized crime \u2013 being landlocked between EU states, the Schengen zone and Ukraine, its location makes it an ideal transit country for multiple forms of organized crime. The system of Slovakia issuing Schengen visas is currently under review.","text - economic and financial environment":"Slovakia\u2019s economic environment has improved in general, but certain sectors have remained vulnerable to organized crime. For example, the country is considered to be one of the worst in the region in terms of VAT fraud. Slovakia has a complex system of anti-money-laundering legislation in place. Nevertheless, there have been reported problems related to anti-money-laundering processes in banks and law-enforcement agencies, which were found in some instances not to investigate suspicious transactions.","text - civil society and social protection":"Witness protection in Slovakia is provided by the police to those who testify in criminal proceedings. There are also protection mechanisms against secondary victimization. Since the passing of a victim-protection act in 2017, the victims of crime are given much more information on their basic rights. However, while the legal framework for victim and witness support exists, its implementation is weak. There are also gaps in guaranteeing victims' access to justice. To improve the support services available to trafficking victims, the government has published an action plan spanning the period 2019\u20132023. While the interior ministry is the main player in providing victim support, many of its services appear to be outsourced to NGOs. Slovakia does not have a systematic approach to the prevention of crime, especially organized crime. However, there have been isolated campaigns run by various state and non-state actors working with communities, advocating against drug abuse, human trafficking and human smuggling. The interior ministry also cooperates with civil-society organizations to disseminate information to the public to try and prevent human trafficking. On the whole, civil-society organizations and other non-state actors play an important role in uncovering crime in Slovakia. ##&& Media freedom is influenced predominantly by large financial groups and local oligarchs. Some media outlets have been criticized for taking a non-objective approach to specific political parties. The media landscape has worsened since 2015, a situation that was exacerbated by the murder of investigative journalist J\u00e1n Kuciak in 2018. Two of the defendants in the murder trial were found guilty in 2020, with the prosecution establishing links between the mastermind behind the murder and key judicial and political figures.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Bratislava","GDP (current $US million)":"105079.67","Income group":"High income","Population":"5454147","Land Area (sq. km)":"49030","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"39","Freedom in the World Index":"90","Human Development Index":"0.86","Global Peace Index":"1.57","Democracy Index":"6.97","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"49","GDP per capita (current US$)":"19266","1":"4.69","1.1":"4.25","1.2":"5.13","2":"5.38"},{"Corresp":"155","ISO-3":"SVN","Country":"Slovenia","ISO-2":"SI","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Central & Eastern Europe","Flag file":"si.png","1.

Additionally, the number of identified victims is steadily rising, but it is not clear whether this is due to an actual rise in human trafficking or whether strategies of identifying human trafficking have become more effective. Known origin countries for labour trafficking are Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine, while origin countries for sex trafficking victims are Slovenia, other Eastern European and Western Balkan countries, in addition to the Dominican Republic. Within Slovenia, ethnic Roma are particularly vulnerable to labour exploitation. Foreign criminal actors are responsible for the majority of human trafficking activity in the country. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Slovenia experienced a shortage of foreign workers, which may have resulted in an increase in human trafficking for forced labour. ##&& Situated on the Balkan route, and a member of the EU, Slovenia is ideally placed as a transit country to smuggle people to Western European countries. Smuggled individuals originate primarily from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Eritrea and Afghanistan. The actors involved are foreign criminal networks, as well as Slovenian citizens. In terms of transit, smuggled persons are typically moved in the back of a van, truck or car. The COVID-19 pandemic does not appear to have impacted human smuggling much, as smugglers largely tend to avoid legal routes.","text - trade":"Slovenia is primarily a transit country for arms trafficking, whereby weapons are trafficked to and from the Balkans via Slovenia to Austria and Germany, or via Slovenia to Italy and other Western European countries. More recently, the port of Koper was the location of several seizures that revealed shipments of different weapons originating from outside of Europe. In recent years, firearms are also sold on the darknet. Those involved in the arms trafficking market are foreign criminal actors working in a transnational criminal network and criminal actors from Slovenia. These actors are also often involved in drug trafficking. Large quantities of the trafficked arms are destined for criminal networks from the Western Balkans in other EU countries, who are engage in robberies, murder and extortion. However, most of the arms-related violence does not take place within Slovenia.","text - environment":"The criminal market for flora crimes in Slovenia is very limited. While official data shows that Slovenia does not have any problems with illegal logging, there are growing concerns in the Slovenian territory about illegal logging conducted both by residents in need of firewood and organized actors using sophisticated equipment. With regards to fauna crimes, Slovenia is a key transit country for birds caught in Eastern and Southern Europe and smuggled to Western Europe. Additionally, Slovenia is a source country for native wildlife, which is poached and smuggled abroad. There is also a growing market for exotic pets in Slovenia. The actors involved in this criminal market are believed to be largely foreign actors, including those associated with organized crime groups. In terms of non-renewable resources crimes, Slovenia is likely a transit country for illegally traded minerals that are trafficked to Europe. Moreover, with the presence of a large shadow economy, there are several cases of transforming lubricating oil into diesel for petrol stations across Slovenia. Slovenian groups also smuggle fuel outside of the country.","text - drugs":"As with other criminal markets in Slovenia, the fact that the country is situated on the Balkan route and is a part of the EU, as well as the Schengen zone, makes it an attractive drug market. Slovenian authorities believe that most drug trafficking in the country involves either criminal networks operating solely within Slovenia or foreign actors operating as international criminal networks. Cannabis is one of the largest illicit drug markets in Slovenia, which is primarily a source and transit country for the illegal cannabis trade. The local produce is sufficient to meet domestic demand, and a portion of the production is intended for neighbouring markets. Overall, attitudes towards cannabis are relaxing both in government and the wider society, and it is the most socially accepted illicit drug in Slovenia. Meanwhile, Slovenia is primarily a transit and, to a lesser extent, a destination country for heroin originating from Central Asia or Turkey, which reaches Slovenia through Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Serbia. Compared to other countries in the region, heroin usage is lower in Slovenia. ##&& With regards to the cocaine trade, Slovenia is a transit and, to a lesser extent, a destination country. The majority of the cocaine that reaches Slovenia is destined for other countries. Foreign authorities have said that Slovenia, Croatia and Montenegro are hubs for cocaine trafficking to Western Europe. As for synthetic drugs, the market is believed to be relatively small. Slovenia is one of the countries with the lowest percentage of lifetime usage of MDMA and amphetamine; however, this is said to be increasing dramatically. There is also a market for new psychoactive substances (NPS), which were especially popular among the youth. However, since many NPSs were declared illegal in 2018, the market has changed, with many substances disappearing and new ones appearing. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has also been a marked increase in the use of organized home delivery and the darknet to acquire synthetic drugs.","text - criminal actors":"Loose, domestic criminal networks do operate in Slovenia, albeit to a limited extent, and are often involved in firearms trafficking, human trafficking and human smuggling. There is some suspicion that to some extent the media is controlled by white-collar criminals with links to organized crime networks. Most of these networks collaborate and overlap structurally with foreign criminal actors, and many of them are presumably sub-contracted by larger transnational networks. Foreign actors, usually in collaboration with Slovenian accomplices and with the support of rackets from Slovenia's neighbouring countries, are particularly active in the human trafficking, human smuggling and arms trafficking markets along the Balkan route. Many of these foreign actors have also become Slovenian citizens, while maintaining contacts and criminal operations abroad. Foreign criminal actors also dominate the drug trafficking market. There is evidence of interaction along the Balkan route between gangs and individuals from Slovenia with foreign criminal actors from the Balkans and Southern Europe. Overall, given the strong presence of foreign criminal actors, there has not been any space for actual Slovenian mafia-style groups to develop at any point. ##&& There is evidence of systemic corruption in Slovenia and a considerable degree of state capture. State-embedded actors are believed to be involved in money laundering, corruption and the influence of informal networks. In many cases of public\u2013private partnerships, complicated schemes are used to cover up corruption, especially in the healthcare sector. Public construction projects are also routinely overpriced and subject to numerous delays, indicating embezzlement. Government-related fraud and corruption scandals were also reported in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and the acquisition of protective equipment.","text - leadership and governance":"The Slovenian government regularly issues statements in support of initiatives to combat organized crime. Slovenia also has one of the more effective government responses to organized crime compared to its neighbours along the Balkan route. However, while the government is doing well in tackling the standard forms of organized crime, especially drug trafficking and tobacco smuggling, it is ill-equipped for handling future challenges posed by hybrid crime, such as sophisticated white-collar organized crime and large-scale fraud. While Slovenia is perceived as doing well in terms of democratic governance, corruption scandals related to government contracts have harmed the public's perceptions of transparency and accountability. ##&& On the international level, Slovenia is part of international organizations and cooperation agreements related to security and law enforcement. The country is also a signatory, with reservations, of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. On the national level, Slovenian law has several provisions against organized crime, including the criminalization of participation in an organized crime group. However, the penal code has not kept up with recent developments and has not been extended to cover new types of organized crime.","text - criminal justice and security":"Slovenia has a judicial system in place to tackle organized crime cases, including criminal offences committed by state officials. However, several problems exist relating to the judicial system and detention, such as the lack of incentives for groups who denounce their bosses and that the maximum amount of detention is two years, which is often not enough to conclude very complex investigations. In terms of prisons, supervision is lax, and many prisoners can easily hide mobile phones and continue to conduct their businesses from within the prisons. As for law enforcement, the country has a special law enforcement division dedicated to tackling organized crime, subdivided into an illicit drugs section, a counterterrorism and extreme violence section, and a criminal groups section. However, frequent changes in the government and underfunding have contributed to concerns about the effectiveness of the national police. At the same time, the government has responded with an effective increase in police wages, signalling its commitment to countering corruption vulnerabilities. ##&& With regards to territorial integrity, despite being a popular transit country due to its location at the European entry on the Balkans route, Slovenian territory is very small and easy to protect. The police and the army work with each other and international groups to ensure state border security. Nevertheless, the country\u2019s borders are still somewhat porous due to its many mountains and forests.","text - economic and financial environment":"Overall, Slovenia has been praised for its strong international cooperation in terms of its economic regulatory capacity and transparency. Furthermore, the country\u2019s economic regulatory environment is considered to be conducive to doing business. Slovenia has extremely robust laws to combat anti-money laundering in comparison to other European states, but the country lacks effective implementation. The country also has legislation on the forfeiture of assets of illegal origin, but this legislation is considered problematic due to the dispersion of related provisions across both substantive and procedural law, and because of difficulties in applying certain provisions.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government has a fairly robust framework in place to provide support to victims to exit modern slavery. Slovenian civil society actors also work on victim support and awareness, largely with the backing of the government\u2019s working group on human trafficking. The country also recently participated in a crime prevention campaign and offers annual training for officials on trafficking indicators among asylum applicants. Meanwhile, there is no overarching general national framework or action plan against transnational organized crime. There are, however, specifically devised action plans by the government's working group on human trafficking, including provisions of health insurance for victims, an increased focus on the vulnerability of the Roma community, and an emphasis on safeguarding the legal status of non-EU and non-Slovenian victims regardless of their cooperation in criminal investigations. Regarding the illicit drugs, the Slovenian government has issued a national programme that specifies the basic principles for drug prevention, focusing on drug use among young people. ##&& While Slovenia does make significant efforts in having productive relationships with NGOs and civil society actors, the relationship between civil society actors, government actors and the media is sometimes unstable, especially in light of cases in which NGOs were discredited or pressured by local government officials or the media. As for the media landscape, the media is partially controlled by influential businesses and individuals involved in white collar crimes with links to organized crime.

Many (but not all) sex-trafficking victims are foreign nationals, coming from China, Nigeria and Romania, among other countries. Human trafficking in the form of forced labour is also prominent in Spain. Criminal networks with nodes in both Spain and the victims\u2019 countries of origin control the trafficking of victims into the country, often promising economic opportunities in sectors such as agriculture, construction, domestic work and shoe manufacturing. In that respect, the Nigerian and Romanian mafia are especially prominent on the sex trafficking market. ##&& Spain is a significant transit and destination country in the transnational human-smuggling market. Smuggling networks exploit the proximity between Africa and Spain to smuggle individuals across the Mediterranean, often via the so-called Western Mediterranean route. Many migrants arrive in Spain via its eastern and southwestern coasts, including from Algeria, Morocco and Western Sahara. The Canary Islands are also an important transit point. Foreign criminal networks play an important role in Spain's human-smuggling industry, with migrant-smuggling networks and groups operating mainly outside of Spanish borders. Several criminal networks combine human-smuggling activities with drug trafficking and money laundering, and there is a notable crossover between the criminal markets for human smuggling and human trafficking.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking is not a particularly prevalent or pervasive market in Spain, and rates of gun ownership are relatively low. The criminal market for illegal small arms and light weapons is controlled mainly by local criminal networks that acquire non-registered weapons at the French border or assemble separate parts obtained on the deep web. To a limited extent, Spain is a transit country for illicit firearms destined for various countries in North Africa, as well as further south on the African continent.","text - environment":"Due to its geographical location, Spain plays a key role in criminal markets for fauna and flora. As an entry point into Europe, Spain is a hotspot in the international illegal trafficking of tropical timber. Much of the illegally harvested timber imported into Europe via Spain comes from South and Central America, as well as from Africa. Spain is a transit and destination country for illegal trade in ornamental plants. International criminals manage the trafficking of protected species of plants to and through Spain as part of a larger network that includes fauna-related crimes. Spain is also a key entry point for trafficked wildlife products into Europe, particularly from Africa and Latin America. Criminal networks operating in this market are based in Spain but have operations in other EU countries, including Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary and Portugal. Various high-profile law-enforcement investigations have revealed several organized-crime networks engaging in wildlife trafficking, including trafficking in birds, reptiles, tortoises, eels and ivory products. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing remains an issue, but the Spanish authorities have made considerable efforts to counter this, resulting in a diminished market. ##&& There is little evidence to suggest that Spain plays anything but a negligible role in any of the criminal markets for non-renewable resources. There have been reports of isolated cases of diamond and gold smuggling, but none of the major routes go through Spain.","text - drugs":"The cocaine trade is the most pervasive drug market in Spain, and constitutes one of the largest organized-crime threats in the country. Spain is a major transit country for cocaine destined for elsewhere in Europe \u2013 and with a substantial consumer base, the country constitutes a sizable destination market. The cocaine trade involves a number of different organized-crime groups of both domestic and foreign origin \u2013 including Italian, Colombian and Balkan-based mafia-style groups. These organizations are believed to bribe customs officials, who then allow cocaine shipments into Spain and thus the EU. The majority of cocaine entering Spain used to arrive directly from Latin America, entering the country in containers arriving at Spanish ports. While these direct routes are still active, cocaine shipments now often transit through West Africa before reaching Spain. There is a high demand for cocaine in Spain as a whole, but particularly in the larger cities and on islands such as Tenerife, Ibiza and Mallorca. Barcelona has one of the highest rates of cocaine consumption of any city in Europe. Spain continues to be one of the main entry points into Europe for cannabis. Cannabis seizures are higher in Spain than anywhere else in Western Europe, and evidence suggests that the country\u2019s criminal market for cannabis is among the largest and most profitable on the continent. Cannabis typically enters Spain via Gibraltar, the Costa del Sol or the coast of western Andaluc\u00eda (with Cadiz, in particular, being a hotspot). Marijuana and hashish are the most consumed illicit substances in Spain. Recent years have seen a sharp rise in domestically cultivated cannabis, with criminal organizations exploiting the economic crisis in the country by employing low-income or unemployment-affected households to grow cannabis for them. A number of criminal actors are involved in the Spanish market for cannabis, including those of French, Algerian, Moroccan, British and Spanish origin. Some criminal organizations even bring workers from Vietnam to grow cannabis in Spain. ##&& Spain is an important destination country for heroin and has a fairly high rate of local consumption. Heroin often arrives in Spain via land or seaports in Galicia. Flows of heroin are controlled for the most part by criminal groups from countries involved in earlier stages of the supply chain \u2013 in particular, Turkey and Albania. Organized crime groups from the Dominican Republic and Pakistan engage in the heroin trade, especially in its retail. Spain is also a destination country for synthetic drugs. The criminal market for synthetic drugs in Spain gravitates around the larger cities and has a relatively young consumer base. Though local production of amphetamines and methamphetamines has been found in Madrid, Malaga and Alicante, as well as in the northern border region between the Basque Country and Cantabria, Spain is far from being a significant producer of synthetic drugs and relies on supply from source countries such as the Netherlands and China.","text - criminal actors":"The criminal ecosystem in Spain is dominated by foreign mafia-style groups of Italian, Russian, Nigerian, Albanian, Colombian, Georgian, Turkish, Armenian, Serbian, Mexican, Dutch and Chinese origin, all of which have a sustained presence in the country. These organizations tend to be very specialized, focusing on specific markets (and even specific functions in the supply chain of these markets) and geographical areas. For example, Italian and Colombian mafia-style groups control a substantial part of the cocaine trade; Turkish and Balkan groups control the heroin market; Romanian, Chinese and Nigerian organizations control human trafficking; and Moroccan and French-Algerian groups exercise heavy influence over the cannabis market. Mafia-style groups of domestic origin are generally less influential than their foreign counterparts. The most potent Spanish mafia-style groups are Galicia-based clans such as Los Charlines, the Ourbi\u00f1a and the Mi\u00f1anco. Often collaborating with foreign actors, these clans are heavily engaged in drug trafficking and money laundering. Los Casta\u00f1as is another mafia-style group that has traditionally wielded significant power and influence in Spain\u2019s criminal markets, but as is the case with some of the Galician clans, the group has lost many members in recent years. ##&& In addition to foreign and domestic mafia-style groups, there are a vast number of smaller, more decentralized criminal groups and networks that operate throughout Spain, working in a wide array of markets, including the smuggling of humans and arms, and trading illegally in tobacco. Several cases in recent years have implicated state actors in money laundering and drug trafficking. However, there is no evidence of a structured relationship between state-embedded actors and organized crime, or of the widespread and systematized engagement of government officials in criminal markets.","text - leadership and governance":"In recent years, the Spanish government has prioritized tackling organized crime, adopting a National Strategy against Organised and Serious Crime for the period 2019\u20132023. However, there are still gaps in the government's response to organized crime, with issues of institutional coordination and persistent corruption. Reports refer to foreign mafia-style groups infiltrating politics at the local level, and an official investigation has been launched against the new president of Catalonia. Nonetheless, levels of corruption in Spain are generally considered moderate and, while the government could improve on its transparency, its institutional and legal anti-corruption framework is largely capable of combating corruption and ensuring convictions. ##&& Spain has ratified key international treaties on organized crime, such as the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the UN Convention against Corruption, and complies broadly with international standards of countering organized crime as set out in these and other key treaties. It is also party to a number of multilateral extradition agreements, such as the European Arrest Warrant and the European Convention on Extradition, and has bilateral agreements with the US, Canada, Australia, Morocco, Liberia, Argentina, Mexico, Peru and others. Spain also participates in several international anti-organized-crime task forces and initiatives on areas such as maritime security. The Spanish government has made significant efforts to adopt legislation that responds adequately to the threat posed by organized crime in the country. In the past decade, new legislation has been introduced to strengthen the country\u2019s legal framework in areas such as human trafficking; and the penal code, which was reformed in 2010, has been updated subsequently with provisions to counter key criminal markets.","text - criminal justice and security":"Spain\u2019s judiciary is independent, and its courts and law-enforcement institutions generally uphold standards for due process. However, there have been cases where the judiciary\u2019s independence (and thus capacity to prosecute high-profile corruption allegations) has been in question. Although Spanish prisons meet most international standards, prison conditions are not always adequate. Overcrowding has been reported in some instances, and healthcare standards inside some detention facilities have been found to be lacking. Spanish law-enforcement agencies have a number of specialized units dedicated to issues of organized crime. These include the Centre for Intelligence against Terrorism and Organized Crime; specific agencies and institutional bodies dedicated to addressing different criminal markets, such as the Nature Protection Service for environmental crimes; and specialized departments within the police force to counter drug and arms trafficking. Border control is also seen as an important feature of Spain\u2019s fight against transnational organized crime, with over a thousand federal police and Guardia Civil officers patrolling the border crossing points at Ceuta and Melilla. Spain's geographical location makes the country vulnerable to the irregular movement of commodities and people, which has proven difficult to curb.","text - economic and financial environment":"Spain's economic and regulatory environment is highly conducive to doing business, but its economic performance continues to suffer from issues such as an extremely high youth-unemployment rate and a very limited fiscal space, problems exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, Spain has a sizeable informal economy, estimated at over a fifth of the country\u2019s GDP, which allows for considerable infiltration of the formal economy by organized-crime actors. ##&& Although Spain is fairly resilient to money laundering and terrorist financing, efforts have been made to strengthen its capacity to tackle these issues \u2013 for instance, by creating the Commission for the Prevention of Money Laundering and Monetary Offences. Nevertheless, law enforcement still lacks asset-seizure mechanisms and the capacity to carry out financial investigations. Spain\u2019s property market and private sector is especially vulnerable to money laundering.","text - civil society and social protection":"Spain\u2019s witness-protection law, adopted in 1994, is outdated and provides inadequate safety guarantees for the witnesses of crimes. In 2015, the government introduced legislation to address victim care in relation to human trafficking. While these measures constitute a significant improvement, few victims of human trafficking are ever identified. Spanish law enforcement has set out new crime-prevention strategies and begun implementing a variety of related programmes. Although they are still in their early stages, they signal a trend towards a more preventive approach. ##&& Civil liberties such as freedom of assembly and freedom of speech are generally respected in Spain. Spanish civil society is vibrant, and national and international non-governmental organizations carry out important crime-prevention and anti-corruption programmes, as well as advocacy campaigns. Press freedom is respected and the media in Spain reports on organized crime without fear of retaliation. Nevertheless, in recent years some journalists have been demonized, particularly in the context of political polarization and friction between Catalonia and the central government.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Madrid","GDP (current $US million)":"1393490.52","Income group":"High income","Population":"47133521","Land Area (sq. km)":"505957","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"44.8","Freedom in the World Index":"90","Human Development Index":"0.9","Global Peace Index":"1.71","Democracy Index":"8.12","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"62","GDP per capita (current US$)":"29565","1":"5.78","1.1":"5.30","1.2":"6.25","2":"6.63"},{"Corresp":"167","ISO-3":"SWE","Country":"Sweden","ISO-2":"SE","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Northern Europe","Flag file":"se.png","1.

However, there have been cases of forced prostitution, and individuals smuggled into Sweden have been exploited in sub-standard work conditions. Women from Eastern Europe - mainly from Romania, Ukraine and Russia - and West Africa are most vulnerable to sexual exploitation in Sweden. Although many of them are aware that they will work in the sex industry, they are misled over the actual conditions. Minors have also been victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced to commit other crimes or engage in begging. Organised crime networks from Bulgaria and Romania operate in Sweden as well, trafficking people into the country and forcing them to beg. Victims of forced begging have increasingly been forced to commit other offences, such as assaults, car theft, fraud and labour or sexual exploitation. Labour exploitation also occurs in the berry-picking, hospitality and construction industries. Although more human-trafficking cases have been detected in Sweden in recent years, this is believed to be a result of increased investigation into human trafficking rather than an expansion of the market. ##&& Human smuggling is a significant issue in Sweden\u2019s political landscape. Sweden is a highly favoured destination for refugees and asylum seekers due to favourable family reunification policies, support for integration and a generous welfare state. While refugees and migrants are smuggled into Sweden, the number of such illicit entries has decreased since the peak of the European refugee crisis. However, smugglers residing in Sweden continue to provide a base for the human-smuggling market, often aided by the foreign diaspora in the country, formed over past decades. The growing presence of foreign diasporas in Sweden has also sparked an increase in chain migration through human smuggling. Fraud is also common in human smuggling. Organized crime groups who facilitate the market may pose as employers, thereby facilitating work permits that allow persons to be smuggled in.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking has contributed to an increase in violence in Sweden, and public shootings linked to criminal gangs have gone up in recent years. An escalation in firearms seizures and illegal gun possession also suggests the presence of an illicit arms trade, although increased funding for border patrol prorgammes also plays a part in the rising rates of seizures. Arms are trafficked into Sweden from the Western Balkans, mostly coming from military surpluses left from the conflicts in the Former Yugoslavia during the 1990s. Arms trafficking appears to be inextricably linked to drug trafficking. Smugglers traffic illegal arms into Sweden via passenger vehicles but there have been seizures of larger consignments, concealed in trucks as well. In addition, online purchases of weapon parts and modified guns have also gone up over the recent years.","text - environment":"Illicit logging is likely to occur in Sweden, but the degree to which organized crime groups engage in the market is either limited or non-existent. On the other hand, exotic timber and other rare plant species have been smuggled into Sweden, albeit on a limited scale. More importantly, however, there are allegations of Swedish companies failing in their due diligence and sourcing illegally harvested wood from the Ukraine. Wildlife crimes such as illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and poaching, and to a lesser extent wildlife trafficking, also occur in Sweden. Most wildlife crimes target protected species but concern violations that occur outside of designated hunting areas. The most prevalent wildlife crimes in Sweden include eel theft and the theft of eggs from protected bird species, such as rare owls. Wolf poaching also occurs, however, there is no evidence to support that organized crime groups are involved in it. In addition, great grey owls have been sold on the dark web. Exotic wildlife, wildlife parts and wildlife products such as tiger teeth, wolf pelts and crocodile skin are also trafficked into Sweden, and ivory demand is believed to be on the rise. ##&& Sweden\u2019s non-renewable-resource-crimes market is limited. However, oil profits are an important source of income for criminal groups in southern Sweden. Companies involved in oil-related crimes use legitimate businesses as fronts. Boat ownership has also been used as a cover to purchase untaxed oil products for resale. Illegal oil discharge also remains an issue in Sweden. A Swedish-owned company was accused of purchasing smuggled oil from the Balkans, as well as engaging in corruption to gain access to African petroleum markets. However, this is not believed to be a systemic issue.","text - drugs":"Cannabis is the most commonly used drug in Sweden, and both marijuana and hashish seizures have increased in recent years. Cannabis cultivation is also on the rise, but for the most part, the drug is imported from continental Europe. Foreign actors control trafficking channels and once in the country, the product is broken up into smaller consignments and sold to smaller domestic groups for them to distribute. Although Sweden\u2019s heroin trade was historically a major issue, it has significantly declined in recent years, largely due to increased law-enforcement efforts against heroin trafficking. The drug is imported from Afghanistan via the Balkan route but as mentioned, heroin is making way to synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, coming from China. ##&& The country\u2019s synthetic-drug trade, on the other hand, is rapidly expanding. Amphetamines are the second most-seized illicit drug in Sweden but Ecstasy\/MDMA is also popular. There have been reports of small-scale production of amphetamines in the country, but synthetic drugs are for the most part smuggled from the Netherlands and Lithuania. Trafficking of precursor chemicals has been on the rise as well. Similar to cannabis, continental groups control trafficking and sell synthetic drugs to smaller domestic groups who handle the distribution. The use of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs has declined, although anabolic steroid abuse runs rampant in criminal circles. Cocaine availability has also increased in recent years, although cocaine consumption is still relatively limited. The drug is for the most part smuggled in Sweden by road or train via the Oresund bridge that connects Copenhagen in Denmark with Malmo. Swedish ports are also vulnerable to shipments of cocaine.","text - criminal actors":"Most organized crime groups in Sweden are dominated by foreign actors, primarily from the Balkans and the Middle East. They are involved in arms and drugs trafficking, as well as human trafficking and smuggling. Foreign criminal groups based predominantly in Eastern Europe also enter Sweden to conduct burglaries, and organized Roma criminal groups increasingly operate in the country. Sweden-based criminal groups rely on foreign cooperation, especially in transnational markets such as drug trafficking. Mafia-like structures also operate in the country. Motorcycle gangs, although not as prominent as during the 1990s, are still part of Sweden's illicit economy but have shifted their activities towards lower-risk ventures, such as financial crime. The most recognized mafia organization in the country is the Syriac mafia, based in the south of Stockholm. The group has smaller membership - 75 to 100 people - and is built on family ties and an ethno-religious identity. Smaller street gangs and other family-based groups also play a central role in Sweden's organized crime landscape today. The latter are poorly organized and lack a strong hierarchy and loyalty. Some of them, however, have sought to formalize and establish a stronger sense of belonging and identity. The main focus of these groups is drug distribution. ##&& Criminal networks are also active in Sweden, with police estimates pointing to more than 200 active groups with around 5 000 members. Reportedly, these numbers are expected to only grow in the coming years. Loose networks operate in larger cities, but have started to move into rural areas and smaller cities as well. They have a strong propensity to violence, which has led to a heightened risk for security services. Thus, there are areas which the police cannot enter without special preparations and enhanced security presences. There is little evidence to suggest state-embedded actors play a role in organized crime. However, corrupt local officials in disadvantaged regions may engage in contract and permit irregularities. Occasional reports of corruption at central government institutions such as the Migration Agency have also occurred and are assumed to have links to organized crime, with the Syriac mafia reportedly managing to infiltrate certain government structures.","text - leadership and governance":"Sweden is among the least corrupt and most stable countries globally. State transparency and accountability is high, and the government has expressed genuine political will to combat organized crime. However, Swedish authorities have been slow to adapt to the emerging threat of organized crime. Although the government has recently implemented a 34-point programme against gang-related crime, an acute shortage of police officers hinders its efficacy. Moreover, Swedish police lack adequate resources to address low-priority crimes that contribute to the growth of organized crime. Sweden has also been somewhat reluctant to seek or receive aid from other states regarding organized-crime-related issues. However, the government\u2019s willingness to cooperate seems to have increased in recent years, alongside an increase in gang shootings in Swedish cities. ##&& Sweden also lacks organized-crime-related legislation that could adequately respond to current threats, although some trends, such as rising arms trafficking, have been recently addressed. Notably, membership in an organized-crime group is not a crime in Sweden, although association with terrorist groups was criminalized in March 2020. Moreover, there are no laws protecting the identities of witnesses, despite increasing rates of witness intimidation. Criminal sentences are also low by international standards, and individuals under the age of 15 cannot be charged with crimes, rendering Sweden an attractive location for organized criminals. Drug policies, on the other hand, are punitive, which has divided opinions in the country. However, the government\u2019s 34-point programme against gang-related crime contains a number of proposals to empower law enforcement and longer-term crime prevention. Due to the light approach of the government to COVID-19 \u2013 it refrained from imposing lockdowns in the country \u2013 the pandemic is not believed to have had any noticeable, direct impact on organized crime in Sweden.","text - criminal justice and security":"Sweden is in the process of strengthening its judicial capacity. As with the country's law-enforcement apparatus, the judiciary is understaffed and has been impacted by historically low exposure to organized crime. The government has also committed to increasing resources for the prison system. Overall, Sweden's judiciary is independent and free of corruption, despite a few high-profile incidents of organized criminals attempting to intimidate members of the judiciary. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused temporary delays in legal proceedings. ##&& While largely viewed as incorruptible, Sweden's law-enforcement bodies are extremely understaffed. Nevertheless, there are structures in place focusing on organized crime. The centralization of police is also often perceived as problematic as this has led to lack of community policing and lack of police presence in neighbourhoods. Allegedly, this has been among the reasons which allowed street gangs to proliferate in socially deprived areas. Sweden's control of its borders is also relatively free from corruption, although free movement into the country as part of Schengen Agreement, as well as long borders relative to the size of the country\u2019s population, render effective border control difficult..","text - economic and financial environment":"Sweden is highly resilient to money laundering and terrorist financing. The Swedish parliament passed new anti-money-laundering legislation in January 2020, and a government committee has been appointed to further strengthen anti-money-laundering mechanisms by reviewing the capacity of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, information exchange between banks and government authorities, and the adequacy of government authorities, cooperation and delegation of responsibilities. There are, however, certain issues, such as the lack of a national AML\/CFT coordination body, which in addition to Sweden being a financial centre in the Baltic region, makes it to some extent vulnerable to money laundering, tax and financial crime. ##&& Organized crime does not serve as a serious impediment to doing business, although local businesses in disadvantaged regions have reportedly suffered to the consequences of organized crime. Extortion is also believed to be on the rise. High taxation, high regulatory burdens, and high general costs in the Swedish economy also provide significant incentives for criminals to cut corners at the expense of legitimate businesses. Nevertheless, Sweden\u2019s economic regulatory environment remains highly conducive to doing business.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim support is not a central focus in Sweden. Sweden has serious shortcomings in treating drug abuse, and has one of the highest proportions of overdose deaths in Europe. Witnesses have also expressed increasing unwillingness to participate in criminal cases, suggesting shortcomings in witness-protection measures. However, enhanced witness-protection measures are under consideration as part of the government\u2019s programme against gang-related crime. Moreover, the Swedish government has a fairly robust framework in place to provide support to human-trafficking victims. Sweden also has various crime-prevention strategies, although these have been criticized for being limited in relation to the scale of crime, and crime-prevention legislation remains less strict than in other states that have a longer history of dealing with organized crime. The government\u2019s programme against gang-related crime also contains a number of proposals for crime-prevention reform. ##&& Civil society in Sweden is free to operate unimpeded, although it does not yet play a very prominent role in crime-prevention efforts. In the wake of recent shootings, however, civil-society organizations have begun to play a more active role in reducing violence. Sweden\u2019s media is among the freest worldwide, and law-enforcement officials actively combat attacks against journalists. Although many Swedish journalists face online harassment, resulting in self-censorship, this is believed to have declined in recent years.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Stockholm","GDP (current $US million)":"530883.87","Income group":"High income","Population":"10278887","Land Area (sq. km)":"447430","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"21.4","Freedom in the World Index":"100","Human Development Index":"0.95","Global Peace Index":"1.48","Democracy Index":"9.26","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"85","GDP per capita (current US$)":"51648","1":"4.57","1.1":"4.25","1.2":"4.88","2":"7.46"},{"Corresp":"168","ISO-3":"CHE","Country":"Switzerland","ISO-2":"CH","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Western Europe","Flag file":"ch.png","1.

Most notably, prostitution has been legal in the country since 1942 and human trafficking has a significant impact on the prostitution market. Reports estimate that around 70% of sex workers in the country are victims of trafficking. In addition, trafficking victims are exploited in the building, restaurant and agriculture industries. Victims are predominately women and children coming from Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Thailand or Africa. Reportedly, one in three victims of human trafficking in Switzerland is an asylum seeker. Thus, there have been calls for a temporary suspension of asylum procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to protect potential victims. Asylum seekers are arguably increasingly at risk of victimization during the pandemic, due to the process of acquiring an asylum taking longer than would otherwise be the case. ##&& Switzerland is also a destination and transit country for human smuggling. Irregular migrants mainly arrive in the country via the Balkan and the Adriatic routes and, although the numbers of irregular entries have decreased since the height of the European migrant crisis, they are still above the numbers recorded in the late noughties.","text - trade":"Switzerland has one of the highest rates of private gun ownership worldwide, however, evidence suggests that the level of arms and ammunition smuggling is low but on the rise since the early 2010s. Reportedly, actors involved in trafficking include domestic networks with ties to neighbouring countries as well as foreign networks who would obtain weapons in Switzerland, often legally, and then traffic the goods across national borders. Notably, the 'Ndrangheta was able to traffic various types of firearms and ammunition into Italy after obtaining them legally in Switzerland. Information also suggests that weapons are often ordered online from Asian trading platforms and delivered into the country, from where they are smuggled to end markets.","text - environment":"Risk of illegal harvesting of wood is low in Switzerland and illicit logging does not seem to be an issue. There are some smuggled flora species coming mostly from Thailand and Singapore, but the market is likely small in scope and scale. Insofar as fauna related crimes occur in the country, Switzerland is described as a destination for wildlife parts and products, where domestic actors collaborate with foreign nationals. Bushmeat as well as ivory and live animal species have been seized on the country\u2019s borders, primarily coming into Switzerland via air, but overall information is scarce. ##&& Conversely, the non-renewable resources crimes market in Switzerland is quite significant. The country is among the largest importers of gold, with significant quantities of gold allegedly being imported illegally into Switzerland. The country is also highly influential abroad, contributing to the expansion of illegal mining across Latin America. Evidence suggests that Swiss refineries receive illegally mined gold from Latin American groups involved not only in illegal mining, but also money laundering and human and drug trafficking. Reportedly, \u2018blood gold\u2019 originating in Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo is smuggled into the UAE before being imported and refined in Switzerland. Not least of all, fraudulently stamped gold bars with Swiss refineries\u2019 logos have been detected in Switzerland, which suggests that laundering of gold also occurs in the country, likely on a large scale.","text - drugs":"Switzerland is primarily a destination country for heroin with foreign actors, especially ethnic Albanian organized crime groups, being involved in the illicit trade. The latter are hierarchically organized and difficult to infiltrate and dismantle, which has allowed them to dominate the heroin trade since the late 1990s. Heroin is primarily produced in Afghanistan, from where the majority of which is smuggled through Iran into Turkey. Estimates suggest that 20 to 25 tonnes of the heroin trafficked from Turkey reaches Italy and Switzerland, mainly imported through North Macedonia and Albania. In contrast to the heroin epidemic and the drug-related violence of the 1990s, the market seems to be under control and has significantly reduced and stabilized. Nevertheless, heroin's direct and indirect social costs are not negligible. Switzerland is also one of the largest destination markets for cocaine in Europe. Since the 1980s, the sale and distribution of cocaine has been dominated mainly by Nigerian groups collaborating with local networks, but groups from Gambia, Guinea, Latin America, Albania and Switzerland have also been known to engage in the market. Reportedly, cocaine originates in Latin America and West Africa and generally reaches Switzerland through Spain and\/or the Netherlands. For the most part, traffickers either use drug mules who smuggle small quantities of cocaine or traffic the cocaine hidden in luggage or vehicles. Cocaine is sold privately or on the internet in Switzerland. ##&& Low-tetrahydrocannabinol cannabis was decriminalized in Switzerland in 2012 is the most prevalent drug in the country. Although detection of illegal cannabis is difficult, it is estimated that the illicit cannabis market amounts to 40 to 80 tonnes of annual consumption. Importantly, the legal and illegal trades overlap as consumers tend to use both legal and illegal products, which may expose them to criminal networks. Studies report between 50% and 70% of cannabis on the Swiss market to be produced domestically, but foreign actors operating in Switzerland, especially Albanian groups, are involved in production as well. Synthetic drugs are also popular in Switzerland, with amphetamines, Ecstasy as well as other synthetic drugs produced and imported in Switzerland from the Netherlands and northern Belgium. Methamphetamine, on the other hand, comes from Eastern Europe and Asia, whereas \u2018Thai\u2019 pills or Yaba are trafficked from the Philippines and Thailand. Reportedly, crystal methamphetamine is produced predominately in the Czech Republic and trafficked into Switzerland. Some production of synthetic drugs does exist in Switzerland, though it is negligible in comparison to other European countries. In terms of actors involved, various types of groups engage in trafficking and dealing in synthetic drugs, depending on the drug itself. For instance, users often buy amphetamines and Ecstasy from traffickers and supply their own networks with the drugs. There are very few street dealers who sell amphetamines and Ecstasy. Meanwhile, traditional dealers are the ones who control the distribution of crystal methamphetamine.","text - criminal actors":"There are many foreign criminal actors active in Switzerland, though their activity differs in scale and reach. Their presence is at times limited to specific individuals, but more structured cells have settled down in the country as well, as is the case with the 'Ndrangheta. Albanian and Italian mafias operate in multiple markets, namely arms, drugs and human trafficking. The cocaine and human trafficking markets are partially controlled by West African gangs; principally, Nigerian criminal associations, such as the Black Axe or the Supreme Eiye Confraternity. Mafia-like organizations are also present in Switzerland in the form of local chapters of motorcycle clubs. Outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMCGs) are also active on multiple criminal markets \u2013 i.e. arms and drug trafficking as well as human trafficking, linked to prostitution markets. OMCGs also engage in extorting local businesses, but try to remain low-key to ensure that they are not linked to further criminal activities. Reportedly, these groups use weapons and are violent in enforcing their territorial control. ##&& Given the domination of Swiss criminal markets by foreign actors, there are only a few domestic criminal networks, apart from sub-contracted third parties. Networks with ties to foreign groups tend to concentrate in major urban centres, such as Geneva, Basel, Zurich and Bern. There are no indications to suggest that state-embedded actors exist in Switzerland.","text - leadership and governance":"Public trust in Swiss authorities is high and the democratic process is independent and free from criminal influence. Authorities have expressed a strong stance against organized crime, particularly the Italian mafia. While corruption is not a major issue, the country remains susceptible as significant anti-corruption reforms are yet to materialize. Reportedly, the current anti-corruption working group lacks expertise as well as an adequate budget and a sound strategy. Vulnerabilities to nepotism and trading in influence persist. In addition, the government is transparent and accountable but certain sectors are not sufficiently regulated, which creates risks of criminality. The legal framework guiding access to information also has shortcomings, which need to be addressed accordingly. ##&& Switzerland is party to most international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, as well as an active member of international initiatives aiming to curb organized crime. Swiss law enforcement agencies engage well with their Italian counterparts, aiming to further improve cooperation in the fight against Italian mafia groups. Sharing of intelligence is also well established both in the Swiss legal framework and in practice. In that respect, while the country's national policies and laws are generally able to adequately respond to current threats, some shortcomings are identified. For instance, while foreign mafia groups are a problem, membership to a mafia-style organization is not punishable. Additionally, Switzerland has objectively liberal gun laws, although a revised arms legislation in line with new EU arms regulations was adopted in 2019, making several semi-automatic arms illegal in the country. The country also has a strategy for the implementation of multilateral guidelines against the small arms trade, but Swiss law does not distinguish between arms that require registration, arms that require a permit and illegal arms.","text - criminal justice and security":"The office of the attorney general is responsible for prosecuting federal offences, including organized crime, terrorism and terrorism financing as well as money laundering and corruption. The Swiss prison system, under the authority of the federal department of justice and police has a small prison population, consisting mostly of foreign nationals, though it is approaching full capacity. Law enforcement-wise, the Swiss federal police is tasked with investigating matters that fall under federal jurisdiction \u2013 organized crime, money laundering and terrorism included. The federal police also oversees the work of special units tackling organized crime \u2013 the Swiss money laundering reporting office (MROS), the coordination unit against the trafficking of persons and smuggling of migrants, and the central office for explosives and pyrotechnics\/arms. Notably, the Swiss police has committed to a new strategy prioritizing the fight against mafia-style groups. ##&& Switzerland is also increasing border controls in coordination with EU Entry\/Exit System efforts, especially since the 2019 passing of Swiss legislation aiming to improve the sharing of police data with European law enforcement. The Swiss border guard also coordinates their work well with other national agencies, including the special formation of federal customs administration, whose mobile support units are tasked with more complex cross-regional investigations. Nevertheless, Switzerland's geographical location and rather lax tax regulations have made it a popular country for money laundering and illegal trading transit.","text - economic and financial environment":"Switzerland has an administrative unit within the federal police tasked with oversight of anti-money laundering. The MROS is a mediator between law enforcement agencies and financial intermediaries. Activities of the MROS fall under the provisions of the anti-money laundering act, and include analysis and reporting of suspicious activities linked to the areas of money laundering, terrorist financing, money of criminal origin or criminal organizations. Nevertheless, financial oversight requires further improvement to more reliably and consistently trace and track abuse of financial loopholes and detect money laundering and terrorism financing. Doing business in the country is comparably easy as the economic regulatory environment is conducive to entrepreneurship.","text - civil society and social protection":"The government of Switzerland has a fairly robust support framework for victims of modern slavery to exit modern slavery. Human trafficking victim support, information and coordination is overseen by Victim Support Switzerland, a platform administered by the Swiss conference of cantonal ministers of social affairs and supported by the department of justice, the ministry of the interior, and the bureau of equality of women and men. On the downside, male victims of human trafficking are comparatively disadvantaged, as support programmes predominately focus on women and children's needs. Importantly, NGOs also provide research and support, including shelter to victims of trafficking. The country has also advanced its witness protection mechanisms over the past decade, evident in the establishment of a witness protection unit within the federal police. While there is no overarching national strategy on guiding organized crime prevention, there are several issue-specific frameworks, namely the National Action Plan to Fight Human Trafficking for 2017\u201320 and the federal council\u2019s strategy for an information society in Switzerland, having \u2018security and confidence\u2019 as one of its key areas. ##&& The Swiss government has a reputation for being open and supportive of a strong and independent civil society sector, which has contributed to Switzerland becoming an international NGO hub. Although there is a broad range of civil society organizations active in the country, few focus on Switzerland itself. Of those that do, most work on issues related to human trafficking and migration. While print media is declining in popularity in Switzerland, many new digital media outlets have come into being in recent years. Overall, Switzerland generally boasts a strong media landscape, but poor access to public information is an issue that hinders data and investigative journalism.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Bern","GDP (current $US million)":"703082.44","Income group":"High income","Population":"8575280","Land Area (sq. km)":"41290","Geography type":"Landlocked","Fragile States Index":"19.9","Freedom in the World Index":"96","Human Development Index":"0.96","Global Peace Index":"1.37","Democracy Index":"8.83","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"85","GDP per capita (current US$)":"81989","1":"4.34","1.1":"4.30","1.2":"4.38","2":"7.13"},{"Corresp":"182","ISO-3":"UKR","Country":"Ukraine","ISO-2":"UA","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Central & Eastern Europe","Flag file":"ua.png","1.

It is a transit point along the migration route from South-eastern Asia and the Middle East, en route to EU countries. Human smugglers bring victims from Ukraine into Europe primarily via borders with Poland or Slovakia. Most irregular migrants detained in Ukraine originate from Vietnam, Afghanistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Turkey, Pakistan, Morocco, Iraq, India and former Soviet Union countries, such as Moldova. There is also considerable smuggling activity at the maritime borders of the Black Sea. This route is used to smuggle migrants from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Turkey into EU countries. Law enforcement data shows that the number of people detained for crossing the Ukrainian border \u2013 both into and out of the country \u2013 has increased.","text - trade":"With a substantial stockpile of weapons, few barriers to accessing arms and millions of small arms and light weapons on the black market, Ukraine is believed to have one of the largest arms trafficking markets in Europe. While it has long been a key link in the global arms trade, its role has only intensified since the beginning of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Most arms are reportedly trafficked domestically, but the illicit arms trade is also linked to criminal arms markets in Russia, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia and Turkey, as well as countries in the EU and the former Yugoslavia. Within Ukraine, the cities of Odessa, Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Kyiv are significant logistical centres for criminal networks. The increasing number of arms combined with relatively limited controls and conflict in parts of eastern Ukraine have resulted in a sharp increase in the size of the criminal market for small arms and light weapons, particularly Makarov and Tokarev pistols, AK-pattern assault rifles and Dragunov sniper rifles. Additionally, there is a smaller market for light machine guns. Firearm seizures have been the largest in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where fighting has been the most intense. Conflict-affected areas constitute the major sources of illicit flows for the rest of the country.","text - environment":"The flora crimes market in Ukraine primarily exists in the form of illegal logging. Ukraine is believed to be the largest exporter of illegal timber to the EU, with substantial felling operations carried out in the Zhytomyr region. Authorities have been accused of being inefficient in curbing illegal logging and Ukrainian state-owned companies allegedly participate in the criminal market. From customs to forest rangers to local administration officials, state-embedded actors play an important role in enabling illegal exports. ##&& Furthermore, Ukraine is a source and transit country for illicit wildlife. The country is targeted by traffickers bringing wildlife into the EU through Ukraine's borders with Poland and Romania. Once there, traffickers use the EU's free movement to transport wildlife to destination markets in Western Europe. Ukraine is also a source of illegal fishing, with poaching and trafficking of wild-sourced sturgeon products continuing, despite an official fishing ban in 2000. It is also a source country for criminal markets in non-renewable resources, a variety of these being illegally extracted, predominantly in the Rivne, Volyn and Zhytomyr regions. The most pervasive of these markets is for amber mined illegally or by artisanal miners. Criminal gangs control much of Ukraine's amber business and there are reports of amber mafias in Volyn that control the region\u2019s lucrative amber trade. Amber is transported from Volyn via land and sometimes by air to Poland. Aside from illicit amber mining, coal mining is also prevalent in the Donbass region, and illegal operations have been growing. Locals usually work as miners, and businesspeople and government officials launder illegally mined coal that can then be sold to Ukrainian power stations.","text - drugs":"Ukraine\u2019s ports located along on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, as well as its extensive river system, and porous northern and eastern borders make it appealing for traffickers trying to access drug markets in the EU. Over the years, Ukraine has emerged as a relatively important transit destination for heroin, seizures of which are quite significant. Heroin enters Ukrainian territory through both the Balkan route and the Northern route, before exiting to western and central Europe, mainly via the Black Sea. Heroin is supplied by various actors, from local facilitators to transnational drug rings. These traffickers use a large transport network, usually road and rail, as well as international ports that link Ukraine to the Balkan route. In addition to being an important transit country, Ukraine has a relatively large heroin consumer base. Like the heroin market, the criminal market for cannabis in Ukraine is extensive. There is evidence of numerous marijuana plantations across the country, which have in many cases been found equipped with systems for heating, lighting, irrigation, fertilisation, temperature and humidity sensors, as well as video surveillance networks, potentially indicating production at scale. ##&& Ukraine is predominantly a destination country for synthetic drugs and psychotropic substances, particularly amphetamine-type stimulants. This market has grown rapidly over the past decade (2010\u20132020). Synthetic drugs primarily from Poland, Lithuania, and the Netherlands are trafficked to Ukraine. There is evidence, however, that some of the supply is provided by local small-scale, clandestine production. With a limited domestic consumer base, the criminal market for cocaine inside Ukraine is small. However, seizures at ports in Odessa and Kyiv provide some evidence that Ukraine acts as a transit country for the drug.","text - criminal actors":"Ukraine has had a strong presence of organized mafia-style groups since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. While their presence has been declining over time, many continue to operate. It is estimated that there are around three dozen criminal bosses, known as vory-v-zakone or \u2018thieves-in-law\u2019. Some of the traditionally influential mafia-style groups include the Donetsk-based Lux, the Samvel Martirosyan gang and the Crimea-based Bashmaky. However, they have become significantly less active since the 1990s and many high-ranking members are either dead or in prison. In addition to domestic criminal actors, a number of organized criminals operating in Ukraine have Chechen, Russian, Georgian, South Ossetian or Azerbaijani backgrounds. Mafia-style groups are usually active in multiple criminal markets, but evidence suggests a focus on arms trafficking, extortion, robbery, murder for hire, and kidnapping. An extremely common activity is to take control of legal businesses via a practice known as raider hijacking. ##&& Moreover, mafia-style groups in Ukraine wield extensive political influence and reportedly have access to multiple levels of the state. In the Donbass region, for instance, various criminal groups have been extensively involved in both political mobilization and campaign financing. It is also argued that the annexation of Crimea occurred in part due to local mafia-style groups leveraging overseas business ties for an intervention in the peninsula. State capture by criminal actors is a pervasive issue in Ukraine and state-embedded actors provide criminal actors with protection and enable a number of criminal flows. Criminal actors are embedded into high-level positions in the state apparatus, working to influence the democratic process on different levels, such as buying votes during elections, supporting and financing certain parties and candidates, and influencing the courts. At lower levels, petty corruption or collusion by law-enforcement and border officials enable illicit flows in the country. In addition to mafia-style groups and state-embedded actors, hundreds of smaller, more decentralized and flexible criminal networks operate in Ukraine. These networks can be formed along ethnic or familial lines, or for more opportunistic reasons, and are engaged in a variety of criminal markets and activities such as robbery, and smaller arms, drug and human trafficking operations. ","text - leadership and governance":"Over the past decade, conflict with Russia has undermined Ukraine\u2019s stability. However, in recent years, the government has shown leadership in the fight against organized crime, adopting a national strategy for combating organized crime in late 2020 and attempting to introduce legislation aimed at prosecuting organized criminals more effectively. Corruption continues to be a systemic challenge in the country and provides organized criminals with high levels of impunity. Nevertheless, key steps have been taken to create more effective safeguards against corruption, and, while public opinion does not always reflect this, the government has updated Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption infrastructure and introduced key transparency legislation. ##&& Ukraine has signed most relevant international treaties against organized crime and cooperates with a number of international organizations. The country has also signed bilateral cooperation agreements with several EU states related to combating human trafficking and focusing on information, technical and personnel exchanges. The country joined the Container Control Programme and is a member of the European Convention on Extradition. Ukrainian legislation covers all criminal markets. These laws criminalize the acts and provide processes for investigation and prosecution. Although the law states criminal penalties for each crime, the implementation and effectiveness has been questioned.","text - criminal justice and security":"Corruption and bribery in Ukraine\u2019s judicial system are widespread and limit the rule of law and practical guarantees of due process. The courts have failed to maintain independence and many judges are subject to pressure from political, corrupt or criminal actors. While judicial reforms could potentially improve the independence and efficiency of Ukraine\u2019s judiciary, critics often point out that the relevant initiatives and reforms are advancing slowly. Most detention facilities in Ukraine are of poor quality and have few mechanisms for complaints. These issues are particularly pronounced in conflict-affected areas. Ukrainian law enforcement suffers from low levels of public trust and widespread accusations of corruption and involvement in criminal practices. National police have a specialized unit to counter organized crime and the national security agency also has a mandate to fight organized crime. The conflict in the east has undermined Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and continues to provide organized criminals with numerous opportunities, rendering it difficult to address organized crime issues in regions such as Donbass.","text - economic and financial environment":"The business climate in Ukraine is among the worst in Europe. It continues to suffer from excessive corruption, a high risk of extortion and weak capacity to enforce property rights. Mafia-style groups wield significant influence in a number of sectors, skewing competition. Nonetheless, the government has been able to stabilize the economic situation somewhat after the events of 2014, creating a foundation for growth. However, Ukraine is vulnerable to money laundering and other illicit financial flows. The State Financial Monitoring Service produces good financial intelligence, but its capacity for financial investigations is limited by a lack of staff. Nevertheless, new legislation has significantly improved Ukraine\u2019s legal anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism framework, particularly regarding politically exposed persons.","text - civil society and social protection":"In general, Ukraine\u2019s system for victim and witness support is weak. While the government has a fairly robust framework to support victims to exit modern slavery, draft legislation introduced in 2017, which aimed to enhance protection and improve procedures for establishing victim status, has still not been passed. There is a law on witness protection guaranteeing protection for victims and witnesses of crime, but it is in need of a comprehensive update. ##&& With regard to prevention strategies, Ukraine\u2019s national drug strategy emphasizes drug use prevention, and aims to shift the approach away from punitive measures towards a public health process. There are many forms of support available to people who use drugs, including opioid-substitution therapy, although widespread access to such forms of treatment is not guaranteed. Ukraine\u2019s civil society is vibrant and plays an important role in anti-corruption and anti-organized crime advocacy. However, many NGOs experience limitations in their access to political backing. The space for independent media has expanded since the revolution in 2014, but the media landscape continues to be dominated by outlets owned by oligarchs, and press freedom violations still occur in conflict-affected parts of the country.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"Kyiv","GDP (current $US million)":"153781.07","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"44386203","Land Area (sq. km)":"603550","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"69.8","Freedom in the World Index":"60","Human Development Index":"0.78","Global Peace Index":"2.93","Democracy Index":"5.81","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"33","GDP per capita (current US$)":"3659","1":"6.18","1.1":"5.60","1.2":"6.75","2":"4.00"},{"Corresp":"184","ISO-3":"GBR","Country":"United Kingdom","ISO-2":"GB","Continent":"Europe","Region":"Western Europe","Flag file":"gb.png","1.

The two primary forms of trafficking perpetrated in the country are forced labour and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, which affect adults and children alike. Victims are forced to work in various economic sectors, both licit, such as agriculture, construction, textiles and domestic service, and illicit, notably within the drug trade. Indeed, the exploitation of youth in the so-called \u2018county lines\u2019 phenomenon \u2013 in which children and vulnerable adults are trafficked and exploited as drug couriers transporting crack cocaine and heroin from major cities to rural areas across the country \u2013 has continued to rise in recent years. Furthermore, the growth of online child sexual exploitation witnessed over the past decade is most likely to have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the human trafficking illicit economy in the UK is highly organized, involving a range of foreign criminal groups as well as domestic criminal actors. ##&& The UK is an important destination country for human smuggling but, although the human smuggling illicit industry may garner far greater attention in the media than does human trafficking, its criminal economy is not as widespread across the country. Moreover, it involves fewer sophisticated organized crime groups in the UK; the professionalization of the criminal market is largely limited to the activities taking place on the French side of the Channel. There do exist, however, domestic groups that either liaise with groups based in France and Belgium or directly organize the irregular crossings across the Channel. The number of individuals irregularly crossing the Channel in 2020 increased significantly from the previous year. While this may suggest an increased ability of smuggling networks to circumvent law enforcement efforts to clamp down on the crossings on both sides of the Channel, the increase is largely the manifestation of a displacement effect caused by the shutting down of formal channels through which individuals can seek asylum in the UK. The refugee resettlement scheme was paused in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, not resuming until the end of the year, which pushed migrants towards the use of smuggling networks instead.","text - trade":"On the whole, the UK has among the lowest levels of firearm offences in the region and gun regulations in the country are extremely tight. Arms trafficking is not a particularly lucrative market in and of itself in the UK and, as such, does not represent a major source of income for organized criminal groups. This notwithstanding, gun seizures have increased substantially over the past five years, with the most common source countries being other states in Europe, primarily in Central and Eastern Europe, often transiting through France, Belgium or the Netherlands. There are several distribution channels for arms trafficked into UK, primarily across the Channel but also via Northern Ireland. Furthermore, there is considerable overlap between the presence of illicit firearms and drug supply within the UK. A key feature of the illicit arms market in the country is the prevalence of modified, converted or reactivated firearms.","text - environment":"Flora crimes in the UK are extremely limited and, insofar as illegal activity related to flora species is carried out in the country \u2013 such as the illegal harvest by collectors of protected plant species, including rare orchids, for example \u2013, it is not a consolidated, organized illicit economy. The UK does, however, play an important role as a transit and destination country for illicit flora species, with most seizures occurring at Heathrow Airport. Nevertheless, the volume of timber imports with high levels of probability of illegality in the supply chain is low and has been decreasing over the past decade. The illicit fauna market is similarly limited, but the UK does play a greater role as a transit and destination country for a wide range of illegal wildlife products, such as live birds, reptile parts and the more traditionally traded rhino, elephant and tiger products. While crimes against wildlife on UK soil, such as illegal hunting or illegal culling of badgers, are not uncommon, as with flora crimes, they are for the most part perpetrated by individuals on an ad hoc basis, rather than by organized criminal networks. Finally, most types of non-renewable-resource crimes are almost non-existent in the UK, with only a few isolated cases of gold theft and illicit export of precious metals. Nevertheless, the oil trade attracts a certain degree of criminality, primarily in Northern Ireland, where criminal groups have sought to commit excise fraud.","text - drugs":"Drug trafficking remains a key component of the organized crime landscape in the UK, and drug use and drug-related deaths are at record levels. While drug-related harm affects all four nations of the UK, Scotland in particular is acutely affected by drug-related deaths, with one of the highest drug-related death rates in Europe. The UK has among the highest prevalence of cocaine users in Europe, and deaths related to cocaine use have increased significantly over the past decade. The majority of cocaine in the UK is supplied by the major global suppliers of Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador. The principal method of transportation of cocaine to the UK is via maritime routes across the Atlantic, using Spain, Belgium or the Netherlands as the main transit hubs. The criminal groups involved in the cocaine market are highly organized and extremely professional, and foreign criminal groups have strengthened their foothold in the UK market in recent years, in particular Albanian organized crime groups. ##&& While violence is limited in the market for powder cocaine, which is considered a largely middle-class drug, the crack cocaine market is far more violent and involves significant levels of exploitation on behalf of the criminal actors behind the illicit trade. A common feature of county-lines trafficking, whereby organized crime groups traffic drugs from major cities to smaller, often rural areas, is the exploitation of young and vulnerable individuals. ##&& In addition to crack cocaine, the county-lines routes also supply heroin. The vast majority of imported heroin is derived from Afghan opium, with Pakistan often operating as a transit hub. The transport of heroin to the UK is then facilitated by well-established links between drug-trafficking organizations in the UK and those operating in source and transit countries. The heroin market is the largest drug market in the country in terms of the revenue generated, and heroin accounts for almost half of all deaths from drug abuse in the UK. As with cocaine, deaths related to heroin have also increased dramatically over the past decade. ##&& While cannabis is the most frequently used and seized drug in the UK, the market does not experience anywhere near the same levels of violence and exploitation as the heroin and cocaine (particularly crack) markets. Nevertheless, the prevalence of illicit indoor cannabis farms has increased sharply over the past decade, a phenomenon that features considerable levels of exploitation in the form of forced labour. Despite increasing domestic cultivation, however, most cannabis in the country is imported, with Afghanistan and Morocco serving as the major source countries for cannabis resin, while cannabis herb is largely smuggled into the country from Southern African countries, the Caribbean and the Netherlands. With regard to synthetic drugs, the UK continues to be a major market for amphetamine and Ecstasy. The domestic synthetic drug market has seen considerable diversification in recent years, with the emergence of a variety of new psychoactive substances, many of which cause significant harm to users, not least \u2018Spice\u2019, a commonly used umbrella term for a whole host of different synthetic cannabinoids. Other synthetics, such as Fentanyl, are also increasingly prevalent in the UK.","text - criminal actors":"According to the National Crime Agency (NCA), there are over 350 000 individuals estimated to be involved in organized criminal activity in the UK, with just under 5 000 different organized crime groups thought to be operating in the country. Mafia-style groups are not particularly pervasive in the UK, but there are several organized crime groups in some of the country\u2019s major cities that display a number of the key characteristics of such groups, including control of local territory and high levels of access to weapons. Nevertheless, such groups \u2013 traditionally family-based syndicates \u2013 have declined substantially over the past decades, with loose criminal networks playing a far greater role in the country\u2019s organized crime landscape. A prime example of the type of criminal networks dominating the scene in the UK is the drug-trafficking networks involved in the county-lines phenomenon. Most illicit economies in the country are, in fact, controlled by such networks: in particular, the human trafficking and smuggling markets, as well as the drug markets. ##&& The most influential criminal-actor type in the UK, however, is foreign criminal actors. Aside from the monumental sums of money laundered through the City of London by foreign nationals, primarily Russian oligarchs, nearly all commodity-based illicit markets in the country feature, to differing degrees, the involvement of foreign actors. The cocaine market in the UK, for example, is largely controlled by Albanian organized crime groups, as is the illicit cannabis trade. The people-based crimes \u2013 human trafficking and human smuggling \u2013 are also largely perpetrated by foreign criminal actors, as these markets are largely facilitated by actors working in source and transit countries, whether across the Channel, in Eastern Europe, Eastern Asia, Latin America or Africa. ##&& The prevalence and influence of state-embedded criminal actors in the UK is very low, and there is little to no evidence to suggest that organized criminality has infiltrated anywhere near the highest levels of the state apparatus. This notwithstanding, low-level corruption persists, and bribery of law enforcement officials does occur, both within the general police forces across the country and within border-control agencies. Furthermore, the increasingly close and opaque relationship between the government and Russian oligarchs may potentially be a cause for concern, particularly in light of the decision to elevate such an oligarch to the House of Lords.","text - leadership and governance":"The UK government is extremely vocal in its desire to tackle serious and organized crime, with significant focus placed on a number of different criminal markets, such as human trafficking, wildlife crime and the drug markets. The current government enjoys a high level of democratic legitimacy and governance across the country is robust. However, the government has still not raised the threat level posed by serious and organized crime to Tier 1 status, suggesting a failure to recognize the severity of the phenomenon; domestic corruption does not appear to be on its agenda; and the prevalence of Russian money has certainly been a blind spot in terms of the government\u2019s willingness to tackle potentially illicit finance. Access to information from the government has improved, but getting information from the court system is often extremely difficult. Furthermore, a number of events and actions taken by the government have considerably damaged the levels of government transparency and accountability in recent years. These include the unlawful prorogation of parliament in 2019; the extensive delay, and eventual content, of the Intelligence and Security Committee\u2019s 2020 Russia Report; and, most recently, the lack of transparency and apparent cronyism exposed amid the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to public procurement contracts. ##&& The UK\u2019s international cooperation framework on matters pertaining to organized crime is extremely robust, with considerable mutual legal assistance and asset recovery in operation. The country has a good liaison network in place and has historically been an extremely proactive collaborator with international law enforcement agencies such as INTERPOL. Overall, from an organized crime perspective, the UK clearly understands the importance of working internationally. However, an acrimonious departure from the EU appears to have soured relations with its continental partners quite substantially, which may prove problematic in the future. Furthermore, although most security arrangements with the EU remained in place throughout 2020 as part of the transition period arrangements \u2013 such as cooperation with EUROPOL, the European Arrest Warrant and access to numerous crucial databases \u2013 international cooperation frameworks will inevitably be weaker in the post-Brexit era. ##&& Domestically, the legislative framework pertaining to organized crime is one of the most robust in the world, covering a significant number of organized crime types, including human trafficking, firearms trafficking, environmental crime and the illicit drug markets. Indeed, the UK\u2019s human trafficking legislation is often considered one of the most advanced in the world. Overall, the UK is fairly innovative with regard to organized crime legislation, is effective at devising strategies and, on the whole, takes a very coordinated approach to tackling organized crime. However, it could be argued that the executive has overused its power to pass domestic laws, and the saturation of the lawbooks comes with a cost to the effectiveness of legislation already in place. Moreover, certain forms of organized crime are often politicized, most notably the issue of human smuggling, which has resulted in legislation that is deemed to unfairly target vulnerable people. Finally, the UK\u2019s approach to drug markets is one of complete criminalization, as evidenced most recently by the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016, with little evidence to suggest it has been effective in limiting the scope and scale of the illicit drug markets in the country.","text - criminal justice and security":"While, in a global context, the UK\u2019s criminal justice system is among the most advanced and effective, highly independent and free from the capture of organized criminal actors, chronic underfunding of both the judicial system and law enforcement has significantly reduced the effectiveness with which organized crime can be addressed. UK courts have been hit by funding cuts over the course of the past decade, which have led to substantial backlogs within the system that have only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  ##&& Similarly, while the NCA has extremely competent officers and a very wide remit to lead and support law enforcement actions at the local, national and international levels, severe under-resourcing has limited its effectiveness relative to the threat posed by organized crime in the country. Staff turnover at the NCA, particularly within the anti-corruption department, is very high, with many staff members being lost to the private sector. While the government has committed to increasing the number of police officers, this would simply be a (partial) reversal of the cuts made to the police force since 2010. While the NCA is highly proficient in tackling certain forms of organized criminal activity, there are a number of areas in which it is fairly weak, in particular in proportion to the severity of the threat, such as financial fraud and money laundering, among others. Furthermore, police capacity to investigate domestic corruption is very limited. ##&& With regard to the country\u2019s territorial integrity, the UK\u2019s characteristics as an island state make it easier, relatively speaking, to exert an effective border-security regime. However, the UK is in a precarious situation in this regard and the country\u2019s future is uncertain, both as a result of the push for Scottish independence, which appears to have gathered momentum in the wake of Brexit and the government\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the post-Brexit border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The risk of renewed conflict in Northern Ireland, coupled with the increased risk of illicit trade as a consequence of any regulatory divergence from the EU, pose, and will continue to pose, a problem to the UK\u2019s territorial integrity.","text - economic and financial environment":"The UK is a global financial centre with an extremely open business environment. The ease with which one can establish a business in the country is a key factor in the relative lack of motivation to operate in the informal sectors. However, these strengths also leave the country vulnerable to financial secrecy, money laundering and other forms of economic crime. Companies House is a prime example of how policies and institutions designed to reduce regulations and facilitate the ease of doing business can, in fact, facilitate astronomical levels of financial fraud. The government has, however, committed to reform Companies House in the coming years. On paper, the UK has an extremely robust anti-money laundering framework, with advanced anti-money laundering legislation that exceeds international standards. In practice, the recovery of illicit funds remains sporadic and largely ineffective. Overall, the UK is a global hub for money laundering and illicit finance and, although certain policy announcements over the past year are a move in the right direction \u2013 such as the so-called \u2018Magnitsky Act\u2019 sanctions regime \u2013 there remains a severe lack of transparency and enforcement of existing legislation, underlining an apparent lack of political will to tackle the issue.","text - civil society and social protection":"A number of campaigns are in place in the UK to raise public awareness of various forms of organized crime, not least human trafficking. On the whole, the UK\u2019s prevention frameworks with regard to criminal markets are fairly robust, and prevention is a key component of many a government strategy on organized crime, as well as terrorism and violent crime, among others. However, the resources provided often do not match the rhetoric. The government\u2019s performance in the prevention of white-collar crime is poor. The government has also been extremely vocal, particularly on social media, in its criticism of irregular migration across the Channel, which is presented with a heavy focus on preventing the smuggling operations of criminal gangs. However, the UK\u2019s border policy does not appear to align with the government\u2019s stated objective of preventing human smuggling, particularly throughout 2020, given the displacement effect of the decision to reduce legal migration channels causing an increased reliance on smuggling networks. ##&& In regard to victim and witness support, the measures in place in the UK are robust by global standards, but in certain areas are notably inadequate proportionate to the needs of the victims. Specifically, while funding for human trafficking support services has increased in recent years, overall resources are still considered inadequate, and the National Referral Mechanism is widely criticized in terms of the treatment of foreign victims of human trafficking and prosecutions of trafficking victims. Furthermore, the UK\u2019s approach to drug use is highly prohibitionist and harm-reduction measures for supporting people who use drugs are fairly limited, although variations do exist between the devolved nations. ##&& On the whole, UK civil society is extremely robust on the topic of organized crime. While the traditional print media are highly partisan, the UK is home to a huge number of high-quality independent journalists investigating and reporting on issues pertaining to organized criminal activity. Furthermore, academics and think tanks are highly engaged on this topic, particularly on such issues as corruption and the drug markets. Non-governmental organizations working on human trafficking, especially those providing support to victims, are also numerous.","Number of pages":"5","Capital":"London","GDP (current $US million)":"2829108.22","Income group":"High income","Population":"66836327","Land Area (sq. km)":"243610","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"41.5","Freedom in the World Index":"93","Human Development Index":"0.93","Global Peace Index":"1.77","Democracy Index":"8.54","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"77","GDP per capita (current US$)":"42329","1":"4.89","1.1":"4.40","1.2":"5.38","2":"7.88"}],"1":"4.49","1.1":"4.21","1.1.1":"4.94","1.1.2":"4.72","1.1.3":"4.23","1.1.4":"2.75","1.1.5":"3.24","1.1.6":"3.35","1.1.7":"4.36","1.1.8":"4.83","1.1.9":"4.88","1.1.10":"4.76","1.2":"4.76","1.2.1":"3.92","1.2.2":"5.16","1.2.3":"4.58","1.2.4":"5.38","2":"6.23","2.1":"6.05","2.2":"5.78","2.3":"7.02","2.4":"6.70","2.5":"6.17","2.6":"6.36","2.7":"6.57","2.8":"5.78","2.9":"6.08","2.10":"6.05","2.11":"5.98","2.12":"6.19"},"oceania":{"Continent":"Oceania","Population":41614850,"Land Area (sq. km)":8536920,"GDP (current $US million)":1638961.59,"children":[{"Corresp":"9","ISO-3":"AUS","Country":"Australia","ISO-2":"AU","Continent":"Oceania","Region":"Australia and New Zealand","Flag file":"au.png","1.

The trafficking of children for sexual exploitation has also been recorded, but to a lesser extent. The forms of sexual exploitation pervasive in Australia are diverse, but forced prostitution in brothels as well as in massage parlours and in personal residences are the most prevalent. With regard to forced labour, the sectors predominantly affected are the construction, agriculture, hospital and domestic service industries, often employing foreign nationals from Asia and other Pacific Island states who have been lured to Australia by employment agencies with false promises of legitimate employment. ##&& Australia is also a growing destination country for the human smuggling market. However, due in large part to the country\u2019s natural characteristics as an island state, the smuggling of migrants into Australia is particularly difficult, and arrivals of smuggled individuals are at among the lowest levels seen in the past 10 years. Furthermore, the human smuggling market, limited though it is, is dominated by foreign diasporas acting as facilitators for various human smuggling ventures, rather than by highly organized criminal groups operating from within Australia.","text - trade":"As an island state, Australia maintains a robust border-security framework that limits the extent of arms trafficking into the country. Nevertheless, the increasing misuse of imported firearms in organized criminal activity and domestic violence is a cause for concern. Arms trafficking in Australia involves primarily the diversion of firearms from licensed and unlicensed dealers into the black market, which is partly driven by outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMCGs) and foreign actors. Nevertheless, most illegal imports of firearms in Australia are facilitated by opportunistic citizens with no prior links to organized crime, as opposed to organized-crime groups. Overall, the level of firearms and ammunition smuggling into Australia is considered to be low.","text - environment":"Overall, Australia plays a limited role in transnational environmental crimes such as those pertaining to flora, fauna and non-renewable resources. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of the timber imported to Australia is either from countries where illegal logging is endemic or travels through countries that systematically turn a blind eye to illegal timber. Furthermore, the illegal export of exotic animals from Australia, primarily destined for Asian markets where demand is highest, is a growing issue, and seizures of trafficked wildlife species have increased in recent years. Finally, while there exists some artisanal and small-scale gold mining in Australia, the country\u2019s mining sector is well regulated and dominated by large mines and major companies, and there is little evidence to suggest that any illegal mining activity takes place. However, corrupt practices in the mining sector are featuring increasingly in the national debate in the country, fuelled by lack of transparency in the sector.","text - drugs":"The drugs markets are by far the most pervasive criminal markets in Australia today. The market for synthetic drugs, specifically methamphetamine, is significant and growing considerably in many of the country\u2019s major cities, in particular crystal methamphetamine, known as \u2018ice\u2019. Criminal groups in Australia are heavily involved in all stages of the methylamphetamine supply chain, namely the manufacturing, trafficking and distribution of the drug. These groups include OMCGs, who have expanded their reach into the Asia Pacific region believed to be for the purpose of sourcing both precursors and\/or methylamphetamines. Indeed, most synthetic drugs in the Australian market originate from the Golden Triangle \u2013 Myanmar, Thailand and Laos \u2013 and southern China. ##&& Use of cannabis, the most widely consumed drug in the country, is also on the increase in Australia. The overwhelming bulk of cannabis consumed in Australia is cultivated domestically, either in traditional farm environments or in more modern grow houses. While cocaine use is also increasing, it does so from a much lower base level, due in large part to the high cost of the drug compared to other drugs in Australia. Nevertheless, the cocaine market is likely to remain an attractive investment for organized-crime groups, primarily those from Latin America, due to the high profits that can be attained in Australia. Finally, heroin is thought to be one of the few drugs that is experiencing a decline in consumption. This notwithstanding, heroin trafficking is present, and the drug is sourced primarily from the Golden Triangle countries.","text - criminal actors":"Among the most recognizable forms of organized criminal actor in Australia are OMCGs, displaying many of the characteristics of the fully fledged transnational crime syndicates that have a growing presence in South-eastern Asia, the Middle East and Europe. These groups reflect a strict hierarchy and use their transnational presence to launder the proceeds of crime, and source firearms, narcotics and chemical precursors for importation into Australia. Furthermore, the criminal group often referred to as the Australian \u2018Ndrangheta is a prominent feature in the organized-crime landscape in the country. Although the group has clear foreign origins, a considerable proportion of its members are naturalized Australian citizens. Despite the prominence of these mafia-style groups, there has been a trend whereby organized crime groups evolve from community-based groups with strong hierarchies and recognized ethnic ties towards more flexible, loosely associated entrepreneurial criminal networks. Evidence suggests that such criminal networks have diversified their activities, engaging in the illicit trade of various commodities across regions and shifting business alliances, as needed. For these groups, the traditional notions of brotherhood, loyalty and honour have given way to more competitive business practices. Criminal networks have developed strong links with criminal actors abroad to facilitate the illicit trade in numerous commodities, particularly in the transnational drugs trade. ##&& Foreign criminal actors are known to operate in Australia, most prominently the \u2018Ndrangheta and criminal groups of Middle Eastern origin, who operate primarily in New South Wales and Western Australia. The latter have developed increasingly strong ties to OMCGs, and the major criminal activities carried out by these groups are drug trafficking and commodity smuggling. Overall, the importance of foreign criminal actors in the organized crime landscape in Australia is evident, and indeed the majority of the country\u2019s serious organized-crime threats are either based abroad or have links abroad. While there is some evidence to suggest that organized-crime groups such as the \u2018Ndrangheta have embedded members in the state apparatus, including law-enforcement agencies, levels of corruption in Australia are low and there is little evidence of state official involvement in organized-crime activities.","text - leadership and governance":"The Australian government has for many years placed the fight against organized crime high on the agenda, implementing a national organized crime response plan, with a particular focus on illicit drug markets. This notwithstanding, Australia\u2019s high turnover of government administrations presents somewhat of an obstacle to the development of long-term government strategies. Although levels of corruption in government are low in Australia, there is no federal anti-corruption body, despite a government pledge to establish one, and questions have been raised with regard to the extent of transparency in government. ##&& Strong systems for international cooperation on the issue of organized crime are in place, including the ratification of all major UN treaties. Australia maintains a strong international network of liaison officers to facilitate the exchange of criminal intelligence and participates in multilateral organizations such as INTERPOL, Europol and the UNODC. In addition, Australia holds a central position in the regional cooperation on matters related to countering organized crime, being an important member to a number of regional security initiatives, and providing considerable assistance to Pacific Island states in their effort to curb transnational organized crime. Moreover, it has a robust system to deal with legal mutual assistance requests in criminal matters and extradition. Australia\u2019s domestic legal framework is similarly resilient, with specific legislation on organized crime, including on drug trafficking and corruption. ","text - criminal justice and security":"As a well-functioning democracy, Australia\u2019s judiciary is fully independent, and while there are no judicial units that specifically target organized crime, some form of judicial control over investigations that relate to organized crime exists. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has made access to the justice system difficult, with courts and magistrates suffering severe backlogs and workloads respectively. The Australian Federal Police Force has a proven capacity to collaborate and promote partnerships with public and private organizations across national borders. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission is a key agency in the fight against organized crime. The commission conducts special investigations, shares intelligence, carries out data collection, conducts multi-agency joint task forces, supports information systems and produces intelligence reports. Furthermore, the Australian Border Force has embraced the digital evolution, furthering the success of the country\u2019s intelligence-led border security. However, the strong stance taken by the government and border agencies on border control has been criticized, most notably with regard to Australia\u2019s strategy to counter irregular migration and to the issue of offshore processing centres for asylum seekers. Moreover, the abolition of the position of the Transnational and Serious Crime Coordinator, established in 2018, appears to be a retrograde step in terms of the country's commitment to a coordinated organized-crime strategy.","text - economic and financial environment":"The economic regulatory environment in Australia is extremely well developed, and highly conducive to the operation of legitimate business. In 2017, the Royal Commission was established to investigate misconduct of banks and other financial entities. Australia has a strong institutional framework for combating money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing. There is a specialized financial intelligence unit that is tasked with anti-money laundering\/terrorist financing, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre. In response to growing concerns surrounding encryption technology and use of cryptocurrencies, the government introduced legislation that brought Bitcoin providers under the supervision of the financial intelligence unit. Australia\u2019s relative resilience to money-laundering offences is due in large part to the increasingly robust enforcement of anti-money-laundering compliance measures, which has resulted in several high-profile prosecutions of banking institutions in recent years. As well as a strong response to combating money laundering domestically, Australia is also a vocal advocate of international cooperation on the issue, playing a key role regionally and internationally in various forums dedicated to anti-money laundering.","text - civil society and social protection":"The Australian government has put in place fairly robust systems for victim protection, largely focusing on victims of human trafficking, although identification and protection measures are far less accessible among offshore migrants and individuals employed in sectors where the line between migration and trafficking is blurred. The strict border-security rhetoric emanating from the government is an important factor in the reluctance of many victims of trafficking to report their situations to the authorities due to fear of arrest and deportation. With regard to support for drug users, the government has increased funding for treatment and support for alcohol and drug abuse, and residential rehabilitation services. Australia\u2019s National Witness Protection Program is largely inclusive and efficient at providing the conditions necessary to facilitate witnesses to testify in trials that prosecute serious crime. Furthermore, the media environment in Australia is free, and civil society is robust.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Canberra","GDP (current $US million)":"1396567.01","Income group":"High income","Population":"25365745","Land Area (sq. km)":"7741220","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"21.8","Freedom in the World Index":"97","Human Development Index":"0.94","Global Peace Index":"1.39","Democracy Index":"8.96","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"77","GDP per capita (current US$)":"55057","1":"4.00","1.1":"3.75","1.2":"4.25","2":"7.96"},{"Corresp":"59","ISO-3":"FJI","Country":"Fiji","ISO-2":"FJ","Continent":"Oceania","Region":"Melanesia","Flag file":"fj.png","1.

Because of Fiji\u2019s patriarchal family structure and the occasional physical violence used to reinforce male dominance, prostitution is a viable option for girls to provide income for their families. The latter frequently act as both facilitators and offenders, but tourists, businessmen and the crew of foreign fishing vessels are also involved. Girls are exploited in individual and organized operations (brothels posing as motels or massage parlours), but boys are forced into prostitution as well. Worryingly, the average age of child victims of sexual exploitation is decreasing. The primary victims of forced labour, on the other hand, are adults, who are exploited in agriculture and construction, mostly in New Zealand and Australia. Fiji\u2019s porous borders and lax visa requirements have rendered the country a key transit point for trafficked workers from Eastern and South-eastern Asia. In addition, foreign actors, primarily Chinese organized crime groups, traffic victims from China, the Philippines and Thailand into Fiji to be exploited in brothels. ##&& There have been comparatively few people smuggling cases, but Fiji appears to be a preferred transit point in the region for irregular migrants looking to enter the US. This is again a result of the country\u2019s lax visa requirements, along with Fiji providing the only air-link connectivity across the region. Profits are probably accrued to foreign actors, who organize human smuggling channels in countries of origin.","text - trade":"While Fiji is a strategic location in the Pacific region and a hub for other illicit markets, there is no evidence of shipments of illicit weapons systematically transiting the country. Gun ownership in Fiji is low, and arms trafficking does not seem to be an issue. Seizures of arms have occurred on vessels in Fijian waters. However, weapons are usually intended for personal protection at sea rather than being stockpiled for further distribution, and there is no evidence of any pervasive organized-crime involvement.","text - environment":"Fiji\u2019s forest area has been steadily increasing since 1990, which suggests that illegal logging is not commercialized. It does, however, take place on a small scale, mainly for local and domestic use. Fiji is home to a number of endemic fauna species, making it vulnerable to wildlife trafficking. Foreign loose criminal networks and individual traders organize the trade in endangered species in the Pacific region, including Fiji. Corruption among officials largely enables the flow of illegal wildlife across the country\u2019s borders. Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is also an issue that the country has to manage. Locals rely heavily on fishery resources for food and income and are involved in inshore and coastal IUU fishing. Quantifying the extent of the criminal market, however, is difficult. The extraction of natural resources, especially sand, has been signalled as an issue in Fiji, although there is no evidence to suggest the involvement of large organized crime structures.","text - drugs":"The drugs markets in Fiji, particularly for cocaine, cannabis and synthetic drugs, are the most pervasive criminal markets in the country. Since 2014, Fiji's importance as a transit hub for cocaine has grown considerably because of its location between source countries in Latin America and destination markets in Australia and New Zealand. Similarly, Fiji\u2019s significance as a transit point for synthetic drugs and precursors has evolved over time. The country has faced the challenges of a growing domestic market for cocaine and synthetic drugs in recent years, with arrests related to the latter increasing almost tenfold from 2009 to 2018. The expansion of the domestic drug markets has led to an increase in gang violence. Unlike international cocaine trafficking, where foreign actors dominate the trade, Fijian nationals control the domestic market. As far as the production and export of synthetic drugs go, both foreign nationals and Fijians appear to be involved, although methamphetamine is also brought in from abroad. ##&& With cannabis becoming more readily available in Fiji since the first post-coup elections in 2014, there is now a well-established market for this drug. Along with Papua New Guinea, Fiji is considered one of the biggest producers of cannabis in the Pacific, but, generally speaking, cannabis grown in the country is used to supply domestic demand. Meanwhile, Oceania\u2019s role as a transit hub for heroin is reportedly in decline, which, combined with lack of demand for heroin in the country, would suggest that the heroin market in Fiji is virtually non-existent.","text - criminal actors":"Criminal networks are the most widespread criminal-actor type in Fiji. Such groups are involved primarily in drug trafficking, particularly cocaine, methamphetamine and cannabis, but human trafficking as well. Criminal networks have links to foreign groups, particularly in the cocaine trade, where the latter pay Fijian groups in cocaine, which is used to feed the domestic market. Small criminal networks are organized on an ad hoc basis to carry out street robberies, burglaries and pickpocketing, especially in towns popular with tourists. Recently, outlaw motorcycle gangs with roots in Australia seem to have gained a foothold in Fiji, becoming more involved in the drug markets. The influence of Chinese mafia-style groups in Fiji has been in decline, but elements of Asian organized crime are still very active in Fiji\u2019s criminal underworld. They have a stake in prostitution, illegal gambling, cybercrime, drug trafficking, as well as human trafficking for sexual exploitation (they operate brothels in the country). In the field of wildlife trafficking, predominantly foreign actors are involved. ##&& State-embedded actors merely facilitate organized crime in Fiji and their influence is rather limited. Reports suggest that low-level officials aid human trafficking, mainly by obstructing investigations, while the increase in drug trafficking through Fiji is contributing to police corruption. Conversely, there is no indication of domestic mafia-style groups being active in Fiji.","text - leadership and governance":"There have been two democratic elections in Fiji since the 2006 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Both were reportedly fair and credible, according to international observers, although Fiji is still considered a moderately vulnerable and fragile state. In the past, organized crime has not been an issue for the Fijian government. However, it emerged as a concern in 2014 and is likely to feature more prominently on political agendas in the years to come. Consequently, Fiji recognized transnational organized crime as a national security issue and took the necessary efforts to minimize the threat. Nevertheless, the integrity of Fiji\u2019s public administration has been called into question, and corruption is widespread. Oversight mechanisms are in place but they are mostly limited and ineffective. Although transparency standards have improved over the past years, more efforts are required. ##&& Fiji is party to a number of international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime and is an active participant in relevant regional forums, although it is not a signatory to UNTOC and its protocols, nor is it party to the Arms Trade Treaty. The Extradition Act 2003 regulates matters of extradition, but no bilateral or multilateral prisoner transfer agreements seem to have been in effect in the country. Close cooperation between Fiji and China is evident in a few instances of extradition of wanted persons to China. Regional cooperation in law enforcement appears to be established on paper, but intelligence sharing between local and foreign agencies limits Fiji\u2019s fight against transnational organized crime. In addition, Fiji\u2019s legislation related to organized crime is, for the most part, either outdated or non-existent. The national legal framework makes provision for each stage of the criminal justice process and criminalizes criminal association, but does not explicitly mention organized crime or organized crime groups. The most pressing organized crime issues facing Fiji, namely drug and human trafficking, are covered by legislation, but more efforts to align laws with international standards are needed. ","text - criminal justice and security":"Although the country\u2019s constitution guarantees independence of the judiciary, political interference in the appointment and dismissal of judges persists, blurring the lines between the judiciary and executive branches. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) handles serious cases, including organized crime. As far as the penal system is concerned, Fijian prisons reportedly do not meet international standards, with overcrowding, inefficient essential services and decaying infrastructure identified as key issues. Smuggling of goods and drugs in prisons, as well as abuse of inmates, are also recognized as issues by international observers. Overall, law enforcement capacity is high \u2013 the transnational crime unit is tasked with countering organized crime, and plans exist to establish a narcotics bureau. However, funding of law enforcement is poor. Against this backdrop, and due to its geographic and topographic features, Fiji\u2019s territory is difficult to monitor and police. Moreover, the state allows visa-free entry to nationals of more than 132 countries. This, combined with the fact that Fiji is the only county providing air-link connectivity across the region and that it lies on a major drug-trafficking route, makes it a main hub for illicit flows.","text - economic and financial environment":"Property rights in Fiji are generally respected but obtaining land titles remains difficult. Union rights have improved, with workers now permitted to form trade unions and exercise the right to strike. As a result, the business environment has improved and the country is now moderately conducive to doing business. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has had a substantial impact on the economy, with reports indicating that a significant percentage of Fijian workers are now likely part of the informal economy - almost two thirds. Fiji has also strengthened its anti-money-laundering framework and has addressed deficiencies identified by the Asia\/Pacific Group on Money Laundering. The country has a financial intelligence unit (FIU) tasked with gathering and analyzing information pertaining to money laundering. There is also a functioning national anti-money-laundering council to liaise between the FIU and other government agencies in Fiji.","text - civil society and social protection":"To address the high levels of violence against women, Fiji set up a sexual crimes division in 2019, as well as a victim and witness-assistance unit. In addition, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is involved in victim and witness care and management, and prioritizes support services to vulnerable groups. Support and healthcare provided to drug users, on the other hand, is poor. The only treatment available is in a psychiatric facility in the capital, Suva. Prevention efforts are also substandard: with the exception of public awareness campaigns and seminars, little effort has been made to prevent human trafficking. Reducing the demand for forced labour and sexual exploitation has not been addressed, and trafficking of children for sexual exploitation, especially, is a significant issue. Cocaine addiction is on the rise, and awareness campaigns, directed mainly at schoolchildren, are inefficient. ##&& Fiji boasts an active media community, which is somewhat constrained in its work by means of the media industry development decree. Although journalists who openly criticize the government may face intimidation or imprisonment, the media situation in Fiji has significantly improved in the wake of the 2006 coup. Civil society is well developed and active, for the most part functioning without interference from governmental structures. There are, however, strict sedition laws that limit the initiatives that civil society organizations can undertake and which criminalize criticism of the government. In spite of NGOs engaging in a variety of fields, such as women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, environment protection and conservation, and education, there is no evidence of NGOs working on issues specifically linked to organized crime.","Number of pages":"3","Capital":"Suva","GDP (current $US million)":"5496.25","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"889953","Land Area (sq. km)":"18270","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"70.4","Freedom in the World Index":"60","Human Development Index":"0.74","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"5.72","Regime Type":"Hybrid regime","Corruption Perceptions Index":"","GDP per capita (current US$)":"6176","1":"3.90","1.1":"3.80","1.2":"4.00","2":"5.25"},{"Corresp":"89","ISO-3":"KIR","Country":"Kiribati","ISO-2":"KI","Continent":"Oceania","Region":"Melanesia","Flag file":"ki.png","1.

Kiribati has the third-largest exclusive economic zone in the Oceania region and effective management is a challenge, which brings about vulnerabilities. The issue has reportedly in part subsided since 2014, but it is likely that foreign IUU fishing vessels are still engaged in IUU fishing in Kiribati waters. The impact on the local population is significant, mainly as a result of overfishing, which limits an essential food source. Likely as a result the depletion of fish resources, there is increasing indication of locals engage in illicit fishing activities. Beyond IUU fishing, Kiribati is a source of sought-after rare coral and reef fish species. The country is also vulnerable to mining for sand, gravel and other aggregates for construction purposes, but there is no indication of the involvement of organized crime groups. In combination with rising water levels, the coastal erosion and degradation of the shoreline associated with mining could be catastrophic.","text - drugs":"Due to its location, Kiribati is a potential transit point for heroin trafficking, although, overall, heroin trafficking in Oceania is declining. Conversely, the region is an important transit route for cocaine, and Kiribati fishermen are likely used by organized crime groups to traffic cocaine.

","text - leadership and governance":"Kiribati is politically stable, although nepotism and corruption, mainly in the fishing industry, are widespread. The government takes a strong stance against organized crime, particularly IUU fishing, which historically has been the most significant threat. Lack of resources, reliance on foreign aid and a weak framework guiding access to public information make the country vulnerable to corruption. Nevertheless, noticeable anti-corruption efforts have been made over recent years, such as the establishment of an anti-corruption unit in 2018, aiming to promote the principles that underpin the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC). Furthermore, officials are arguably aware of the power that is bestowed upon them, which positively affects transparency and reduces the potential for corruption, at least in smaller, local governance. ##&& Kiribati is party only to the UNTOC and two of its three protocols, as well as the Arms Trade Treaty and the UNCAC. Kiribati has been responsive to international pressures to ban fishing in at least sections of its territorial waters. Nevertheless, the international community has made calls for the country to increase restrictions and has emphasized that Kiribati is not able to tackle the issue as an individual government. Kiribati also collaborates with the Pacific Transnational Crime Network, the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police and other regional security bodies, which seek to provide island countries in the Pacific with police-led intelligence and investigation capabilities to better tackle organized crime. The country\u2019s national legislative framework is sufficiently sound and adequately addresses organized crime. The laws reflect model provisions developed by the Pacific Islands Forum and New Zealand, and meet many, if not most, of the standards set by relevant international treaties.","text - criminal justice and security":"Certain deficiencies within the judicial system in Kiribati were identified, such as a lack of qualified legal support for and limited training of magistrates, leading to a backlog of cases. In response, a project spanning 2014\u20132017 and aiming to improve case management as well as develop core skills in problem areas was implemented with the support of the Commonwealth. The project was to ultimately enable the High Court to act as an independent and effective service, in line with international standards. Information on the results, however, is lacking. The prison system is inadequate: poor detention conditions and lack of security, allowing prisoners to move freely in and out of prisons, are the most obvious challenges. There are specialized law-enforcement units (the Transnational Crimes Unit, the Organized Crime Department and the Kiribati Police Maritime Unit) tasked with countering organized crime, but it is difficult to assess their capacities. In any case, training and staffing programmes backed by foreign donors have been implemented. Nevertheless, the positive changes are driven not by national initiatives, but rather by external pressures and foreign donors. Kiribati has no capacity to adequately manage its borders due to a general lack of resources and the country\u2019s isolated geography. Additionally, its relative proximity to US territories opens up additional vulnerabilities to organized crime. Thus, borders are highly porous and often used by foreign actors, mostly for illegal fishing. Illegal mining of sand, gravel and other aggregates for construction purposes are contributing to coastal erosion and degradation of the shoreline.

The heavy economic regulations make doing business in the country extremely difficult. At the same time, it is only a small economy to regulate due to a lack of skilled workers, weak infrastructure and vast distances from neighbouring countries\u2019 markets. Kiribati is also highly dependent on foreign aid and, by extension, extremely vulnerable to foreign actors\/donors and state capture. A lack of human resources and know-how is identified as a further obstacle in building more resilience in this context.","text - civil society and social protection":"No victim or witness support structures have been identified in Kiribati.

The research, resources and skills needed for effective and sustainable prevention programmes to be developed are lacking. In 2019, New Zealand aided the Pacific Crime Prevention Programme in order to develop a more preventative approach to policing in the region. It is unclear, however, whether the programme addresses the prevention of organized crime, which is arguably in its infancy in the region. The civil-society sector is generally well developed, with NGOs cooperating with the government in matters of countering overfishing and protecting endangered marine species. The media sector is free of interference, although it is neither large nor diverse. Nevertheless, citizens have access to information, including foreign radio services. In 2018, Kiribati signed a deal to establish a high-speed internet connection by means of undersea cables, potentially allowing further access to more diverse media content.","Number of pages":"3","Capital":"Tarawa","GDP (current $US million)":"194.65","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"117606","Land Area (sq. km)":"810","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"","Freedom in the World Index":"93","Human Development Index":"0.63","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"","Regime Type":"","Corruption Perceptions Index":"","GDP per capita (current US$)":"1655","1":"2.35","1.1":"2.45","1.2":"2.25","2":"4.33"},{"Corresp":"109","ISO-3":"MHL","Country":"Marshall Islands","ISO-2":"MH","Continent":"Oceania","Region":"Micronesia","Flag file":"mh.png","1.

Foreign individuals or groups in the country drive demand for sexual exploitation, while domestic actors are involved as both victims and perpetrators. Children from the Marshall Islands are also trafficked to and sexually exploited in the United States. Even though there is no indication that trafficking for adoption is a common practice, a recent case flagged the country\u2019s vulnerability to this practice. The Marshall Islands is also a destination country for victims of sexual exploitation from East Asia. Young girls and women, mainly from China, are lured into travelling to the Marshall Islands and forced into prostitution. Labour exploitation is also present domestically. Often wealthier families exploit impoverished Marshallese from the outer islands under the pretext of traditional cultural practices. In addition, foreign fishermen are exploited in practices indicative of forced labour on fishing vessels in Marshallese waters, while the country\u2019s citizens are known to be exploited abroad as well. In spite of the market being so pervasive, generated proceeds are low and usually accrue to both local and foreign actors. ##&& Conversely, it appears that human smuggling does not affect the Marshall Islands on any significant scale as neither a source, transit nor destination country. There have been allegations that foreign nationals have acquired travel or identity documents from the Marshall Islands to get access to the United States, but that practice has largely declined, or ceased altogether.","text - trade":"Trafficking in stolen firearms is among the more prominent criminal markets affecting the Marshall Islands. Assessments of civilian-held firearms, however, show that the number of privately owned small arms is minuscule, which would suggest the market is comparatively small. There is no indication that the market accrues any significant profit or involves sizeable financial transactions.","text - environment":"There are no indications that trafficking in flora products occurs in the Marshall Islands, with few to no criminal opportunities available. On the other hand, wildlife crime and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in particular, is one of the most significant forms of transnational organized crime in the country. IUU fishing is mainly carried out by legally licensed vessels fishing above approved quotas. Related to that, the country is host to the third-largest ship registry of \u2018flags of convenience\u2019, which facilitate transnational maritime crime, including fisheries crimes. As a source country for illegal fishing, the Marshall Islands is deeply affected, because overfishing negatively influences marine life\/fish resources and consequently the locals, who rely on fish as an important food source. Given the extent of IUU fishing, the value of the market is significant by regional and global comparison. Although reef mining has occurred on the Marshall Islands, there is no evidence to suggest the involvement of organized crime groups or illegality.","text - drugs":"Cannabis is grown locally to satisfy domestic demand. Although evidence suggests the cannabis market may be declining in the country, it is likely that the prevalence of cannabis, and thus the size and value of the market, is significantly higher than that of other drugs. There is indication that amphetamine-type stimulants might be traded in low quantities into or through the Marshall Islands. The country is mainly a destination for synthetic drugs, reporting the highest annual prevalence rate of amphetamines-group substances among countries in Oceania. ##&& Although there is no evidence to suggest the existence of heroin trafficking in the Marshall Islands or through its territories, the use of cocaine has escalated in recent years. Instances of cocaine washing up ashore or being caught in fishing nets have also been recorded, pointing to organized seaborne trans-shipments crossing Marshallese waters. Beyond the negative health consequences of cocaine use reported by officials, there is little information to assess the societal impact of cocaine trafficking.","text - criminal actors":"Due to the strategic geographic location of the Pacific Island countries, there is high interest in exploiting them as transit hubs for trafficking, and the Marshalls are no exception. Illicit cross-border trade and trans-shipment (including marine species and amphetamine-type stimulants or cocaine) going through Marshallese territorial waters involve private and commercial entities, most of them from other countries. Thus, much of the criminal activity in the Marshall Islands can be attributed to foreign actors. There are also reports of gang activity in the Marshall Islands, with such entities forming due to a lack of legitimate employment opportunities. Besides anecdotal evidence of organized criminal networks involved in the domestic trade of cocaine, little else is known of their activities. ##&& Arguably, both minor and high-level corruption, as well as rent-seeking, exists throughout the Pacific Island countries, the Marshall Islands included. These are opportunistic crimes, which arise mainly because of the low incomes earned by officials. In contrast, there is no evidence that mafia-style groups exist or operate in the country.","text - leadership and governance":"Particular crimes of concern, such as IUU fishing and human trafficking, feature on the political agenda in the country, with political leaders showing commitment to tackling organized crime. Accordingly, concrete steps have been implemented to put measures into practice. Nevertheless, chronic corruption that spans the higher echelons of power compromises anti-organized-crime commitments. In spite of auditing bodies and independent courts being somewhat efficient in detecting and prosecuting corruption cases, investigation is subpar. Transparency is also problematic, due to the absence of a legal mechanism guiding public access to information. In addition to practical and legal measures being adopted to remedy that deficiency, a joint programme with the World Bank was launched in late 2018. The aim was to strengthen public procurement and budget reporting processes, with the ultimate purpose being to enhance transparency. ##&& Although the Marshall Islands is party to a number of relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, it has not yet signed or ratified the UNTOC or any of its protocols. There is a basic institutional framework to facilitate international criminal justice cooperation, but additional resources and expertise from donor countries and international organizations are needed. Against this backdrop, law enforcement bodies across the region tend to operate relatively isolated from one another and the Marshall Islands is no exception. Nevertheless, the country is member to a number of regional security initiatives and there is an INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Majuro, which is part of the Marshall Islands Police Department. The NCB is the point of contact for international law-enforcement cooperation and plays an essential role in the analysis, detection, investigation and prevention of organized crime. A fairly comprehensive legal framework covers key organized-crime types and is well positioned to respond to current threats that may involve overseas crime groups.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judiciary in the Marshall Islands generally operates without political interference, but judges and prosecutors may lack specific expertise in transnational organized crime and related laws. Therefore, there is a recognizable need for increased capacity building within both the judicial and law-enforcement system. As emphasized, the NCB plays a critical role in anti-organized-crime efforts, and the country is working towards achieving better regional cooperation. Human and material resources at the disposal of law enforcement agencies are very limited, but the Marshall Islands is able to adequately respond to the present organized-crime situation and maintain its territorial integrity. Nevertheless, some improvement might be required to achieve a better level of preparedness and alertness. The Marshall Islands remains vulnerable to fisheries crime, especially given the geography and topography of the country, which makes it difficult to patrol its territorial waters, coastline and borders effectively.","text - economic and financial environment":"There is a high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing and the current anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing framework is insufficient to respond to potential threats, requiring it\u2019s alignment with international standards. Anti-money laundering agencies are operational in the country, but lack adequate technical and human resources. Likewise, the economic regulatory environment in the Marshall Islands is not conducive to doing business. It is arguable that, because of the unattractive business environment, there is no incentive for criminal elements to infiltrate business or the legal economy, especially from abroad.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim and witness support services are poorly developed or in some instances lacking altogether. There are procedures for the identification of victims of trafficking in place but they are reportedly not used, nor are assistance measures employed for confirmed victims of trafficking. The lack of resources once more appears to be a major obstacle in enhancing the scope of victim and witness support. Prevention efforts in relation to organized crime, especially trafficking in people, appear to be in their infancy and only marginally developed. Conversely, prevention of IUU fishing features more prominently on the country\u2019s agenda, with efforts made to establish international cooperation to curb the practice. In addition, the Marshall Islands has expressed interest in ratifying the Agreement on Port State Measures as a tool to block IUU fishing vessels from docking in its ports. ##&& The Marshall Islands has robust civil society organizations, many of which provide social services (including to victims of human trafficking) and are able to operate freely. The full potential of civil society actors, however, has yet to be used more efficiently in pursuing better preventive and counter measures against organized crime. Freedom of speech and of the press, as well as religious freedom, are generally respected in the country.","Number of pages":"3","Capital":"Majuro","GDP (current $US million)":"221.28","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"58791","Land Area (sq. km)":"180","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"","Freedom in the World Index":"93","Human Development Index":"0.7","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"","Regime Type":"","Corruption Perceptions Index":"","GDP per capita (current US$)":"3788","1":"2.32","1.1":"2.50","1.2":"2.13","2":"5.04"},{"Corresp":"113","ISO-3":"FSM","Country":"Micronesia (Federated States of)","ISO-2":"FM","Continent":"Oceania","Region":"Micronesia","Flag file":"fm.png","1.

The domestic market for sexual exploitation is mainly fuelled by foreign crew members or construction workers, but offending is more likely opportunistic than organized by sex-trafficking rings. Micronesian women are also forced into prostitution or labour abroad, in the United States and Guam, because of the visa-free entry granted to Micronesians. It is likely that foreign organized crime groups are involved in luring women from FSM and exploiting them abroad. Foreign nationals, especially from the Philippines, are vulnerable to labour trafficking into FSM. Workers from South-east Asian countries have reported suffering exploitation on fishing vessels in FSM or its territorial waters, sailing under Asian flags. ##&& FSM nationals can freely enter the US and its territories, which eliminates the need for smuggling. It appears that smuggling affects FSM in one of two ways: (1) it morphs into trafficking or enables trafficking in persons where victims of sex or labour exploitation in FSM need first be smuggled into the country, and (2) migrants may be smuggled into and through FSM to gain access to the United States, a phenomenon that is not well documented.","text - trade":"Gun ownership (both licit and illicit) in FSM is negligible and the country does not appear to be affected by gun violence, which suggests an arms-trafficking market does not exist in the country.","text - environment":"Given the geography, location and flora of FSM, it is unlikely that an organized flora-crime market exists in the country. Because of the small area of forested land, domestic requirements are met through imports. There is no evidence that timber is entering the local market. Likewise, there are no reports indicating any transnational criminal activities involving non-renewable resources in FSM. However, the single largest natural resource in FSM is its fishery, which has an extensive exclusive economic zone (EEZ) that is difficult to police. This makes the country vulnerable to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, carried out primarily by foreign actors that collude with or are otherwise supported by people in FSM. As with elsewhere in the region, the impact of IUU fishing is significant because it deprives local populations of a key food source and a main source of income.","text - drugs":"An important cocaine trafficking route passes through Micronesia, linking source countries in Latin America to large destination markets in New Zealand and Australia. Mostly foreign groups are involved in this trafficking. As demand for cocaine appears low or non-existent in FSM, it is likely that no Micronesians are involved in domestic trade, although locals may participate in transporting cocaine. Arguably, synthetic drugs are also transported along the same shipping routes as cocaine, but evidence suggests that couriers and parcel post are used as well. While FSM is primarily a transit point for synthetic drugs \u2013 methamphetamine in particular \u2013 and domestic demand is low at the moment, the growing synthetic-drug markets in Palau, Fiji, Tonga and Samoa might indicate a future spillover of use into the country. As with cocaine trafficking, mostly foreign actors are engaged in moving synthetic drugs from the Philippines through FSM and on to Palau, Guam and Hawaii. ##&& Cannabis use is reportedly significant in FSM, but the market is fed by the local demand with no evidence of cannabis exports. The cultivation, sale and consumption of cannabis in FSM appear to be in the hands of domestic groups. There is no indication that FSM or its territorial waters are used to transport heroin, and domestic demand for the drug is non-existent. ","text - criminal actors":"Given the strategic geographic location of FSM at the crossroads between source countries for cocaine and synthetic drugs, and large consumer markets, in combination with its extensive EEZ, the country is highly vulnerable to drug trafficking and IUU fishing, mostly perpetrated by foreign actors. Criminal groups of Chinese and Taiwanese origin are known to be involved in illegal fishing, while groups of Filipino origin are active in the illicit synthetic-drug trade. Nationals from neighbouring countries in Asia and the Pacific appear to engage in criminal activities and provide the demand, supply and\/or transportation. It is likely that foreign actors have established ties to local populations and recruit people from FSM to their operations. Loose criminal networks originating in FSM may be linked to transnational criminal networks and collaborate in trafficking and\/or trade of illicit products. Domestic networks are also involved in the cannabis trade in FSM. ##&& Little information is available on state-embedded actors in Micronesia, although, as with other Pacific island countries, corruption risks appear around the issuing of fishing licences. Nevertheless, corruption levels appear to be manageable and relatively low by global standards. There is no evidence to suggest the involvement of mafia-style groups in any criminal markets in FSM, or their existence, for that matter.","text - leadership and governance":"FSM is a relatively stable democracy, although some vulnerability and fragility are present, caused particularly by external pressures on security and economics. In addressing such problems, the leadership of the country has shown some commitment to issues related to transnational organized crime, although measures are difficult to implement without external assistance. Even though corruption is not a major issue, there are concerns over low-level bribery and misuse of public resources. The lack of a national anti-corruption body and an adequate strategy has been criticized, but FSM took steps to establish such an authority in 2019. Principles of transparency are generally observed, however, there is no legal framework guiding public access to information. ##&& While FSM is party to a number of international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, it has yet to sign or ratify two of the three protocols supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the Arms Trade Treaty, or the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Additionally, the resources needed for FSM to align its legislative framework with international treaties are very limited. Similarly, the enhancement of law-enforcement capacities is driven by external agencies and the country\u2019s participation in regional initiatives, such as the Pacific Islands Law Officers\u2019 Network and the Pacific Transnational Crime Network, among others. By and large, FSM\u2019s laws meet minimum national standards and criminalize a number of acts related to transnational organized crime, including criminal association. National policies and their implementation tend to be inconsistent across FSM's islands. For example, the fact that each of the four states of FSM (Yap, Pohnpei, Chuuk and Kosrae) has its own human-trafficking laws complicates matters. Further improvements are necessary for a robust legal framework to be drafted and implemented.","text - criminal justice and security":"The country\u2019s justice system is extremely slow and may not meet Western legal standards. Court-appointed attorneys, as well as judges, may not have legal training comparable to that found in developed Western democracies. There are some units specifically focused on matters related to organized crime, such as the anti-human trafficking division within the department of justice, although there is no overarching judicial authority for organized crime. No concerns of human rights violations or significant issues with the prison system in FSM have been flagged, except for the lack of a prison ombudsperson to respond to complaints and that allegations of inhumane treatment are rarely followed up with investigations. ##&& Although FSM currently does not have a police or intelligence unit specifically designated for organized crime \u2013 apart from the fact that fishing law falls under the jurisdiction of the National Police\u2019s Maritime Unit \u2013 all four states have their own anti-human trafficking task force made up of both national and state law-enforcement officers. However, only the task forces in Chuuk and Pohnpei were active in 2019. In general, FSM law enforcement does not have the financial or human resources to meet international standards on its own and depends on membership in various regional initiatives to enhance its law-enforcement capacities against transnational organized crime. As with other Pacific island countries, FSM\u2019s borders are naturally porous and difficult to monitor. International cooperation, especially in law enforcement and intelligence sharing, is therefore critical for effectively tackling transnational organized crime. ","text - economic and financial environment":"The country\u2019s commitment to implementing anti-money laundering (AML) measures has been lacking, as seen in its deficient compliance with Financial Action Task Force recommendations. The country has also been criticized for the absence of a comprehensive AML framework. The impact of money laundering is difficult to quantify, however, as there has not been any assessment of the levels and patterns of money-laundering activities in or involving FSM. The potential for economic development is limited, given the scarcity of resources and FSM\u2019s location, size and small population. ##&& There are few incentives to do business in the country yet, at the same time, the economic regulatory framework appears quite constrictive. The country also depends on assistance from the US under the Compact of Free Association. In fact, 58% of government funding comes through the Compact of Free Association agreement, which runs out in 2023. It is unclear whether the agreement will be extended, which creates economic uncertainty. If it is not, a geopolitical shift to China is a possibility, which could bring new opportunities for Chinese organized crime groups that are already active in the region to engage in FSM markets.","text - civil society and social protection":"Victim support and prevention measures in FSM are largely limited to human trafficking. Support and protection efforts are adequate by regional and international standards, while prevention efforts are reportedly quite advanced. Most notably, the anti-human trafficking division, which was established in 2019, is responsible for victim protection, raising awareness about human trafficking and drafting anti-human trafficking training programmes. The government continues to implement the National Action Plan on trafficking, and three of the four states have existing action plans that relate to it. Additionally, the government opened the first shelter for victims of crime in Chuuk in 2019 and increased funding for victim services. Nevertheless, further strengthening of these frameworks is required. There is little information on the availability of prevention measures in relation to other crime types, especially illicit drugs. Regarding IUU fishing, the government is supported by Australia's North Pacific Aid Programme, which includes assistance in the management of fisheries, the mitigation of impacts of severe climate, tidal and oceanographic events and the strengthening of governance and accountability. ##&& Civil society operates freely in FSM. Non-state actors, however, only marginally address issues pertaining to organized crime because of the relatively low levels of organized crime and the small size of the country and its population.

With regard to non-renewable resources, phosphate has historically been, and continues to be, an important contributor to Nauru\u2019s economy. As with other environmental markets in the country, nothing points to organized crime groups being involved in any form of illicit mining activity, although there have been allegations of corruption within the extractives sector.","text - drugs":"There is no indication that any drug markets exist in Nauru.

Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest Nauru plays any role as a transit country in the transnational heroin, cocaine, cannabis or synthetic drug trade.","text - criminal actors":"Given the absence of organized criminal activity in Nauru, organized criminal actors do not operate in the country. Due to Nauru\u2019s location, population, demographics and limited trade and transport infrastructure, there are very few opportunities for criminal predation in the country. The government exerts full control over licit markets, in which it often exhibits abuses of power, in particular with regard to the mining of phosphate, where allegations of bribery of government officials have been made.","text - leadership and governance":"The organized crime landscape in Nauru very rarely features in government communications. Political developments and decision-making in Nauru are often heavily influenced by foreign governments, in particular Australia, due to the establishment of the now closed Australian refugee processing centre that was crucial to the Nauruan economy. The high level of foreign involvement has had mixed results but has certainly had a negative impact on the international reputation of the island state. Nevertheless, the government has made efforts to tackle criminal activity where necessary, in particular with regard to the country\u2019s reputation as a tax haven and the consequent money laundering activity that takes place in Nauru. However, there are almost no effective mechanisms in place to fight corruption in the state apparatus, and government transparency, on the whole, is very limited. There is no access-to-information law in place and the concentration of media outlets in the hands of the state comes as a detriment to government transparency and accountability. ##&& Nauru has ratified the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its three protocols on migrant smuggling, trafficking in persons and the illicit arms trade, and has acceded to the UN Convention against Corruption and the 1988 UN Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Nauru is also a member of INTERPOL and the Pacific Islands Law Officers\u2019 Network, Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police and the Pacific Islands Forum. Overall, Nauru has the legislative and institutional measures in place to enable and engage in international cooperation, but practical and actual international cooperation appears to be ad hoc rather than strategic and is heavily influenced by major donor countries. Furthermore, information on actual cases of extradition and mutual legal assistance is very limited, as is Nauru\u2019s ability to make and respond to requests for international criminal justice cooperation. With regard to Nauru\u2019s domestic legislation, the legal framework pertaining to organized crime is sound and of a higher standard than many countries in the region. The new criminal code, adopted in 2016, contains several provisions on different forms of organized crime, including the possession of firearms and modern slavery, but, given the limited extent of organized criminal activity, evidence of effective implementation of the legislation is scarce.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judicial system in Nauru is sufficiently capable of addressing the current organized crime threat in the country. Given that it is a limited threat, there are no judicial units tasked with dealing specifically with organized crime. Similarly, prison conditions in the country have generally met international standards and there is no evidence of criminal actors controlling illicit activity within the country\u2019s single prison. ##&& Its small size and location make Nauru fairly resilient to transnational organized crime threats. As with the judicial system, there are no law enforcement units that specifically focus on organized crime, largely due to the absence of any organized crime threat. Given the scarcity of organized crime markets and actors in the country, it is likely that most police and other law enforcement officials have little training or experience with organized crime. However, Nauru is part of a network of transnational crime police units in the Pacific, which may also provide an avenue to seek assistance should any serious cases of organized crime arise. Overall, law enforcement in Nauru is heavily reliant on international assistance from other Pacific island states, Australia and New Zealand for major criminal investigations and, as such, these cooperative efforts provide a safety net.","text - economic and financial environment":"The vast majority of the labour force in Nauru is employed in either phosphate mining or the public sector, such as education, transport or public administration, making the government the country\u2019s single largest employer. While the economy experienced significant growth in past decades due to the success of the phosphate sector, depletion of the resource, together with a considerable lack of economic diversification in the country, has left Nauru\u2019s economy in an extremely fragile state. Although growth has picked up in recent years, the declining revenue from phosphate mining and activities associated with the Regional Processing Centre for asylum-seekers means that there are few avenues available for future growth. This, in turn, may have a negative impact on unemployment rates and by extension, may potentially serve to stimulate the informal economy. ##&& In the early 1990s, Nauru was a money-laundering haven, but since then the government has made considerable efforts to improve the country's anti money-laundering framework. The country is a member of the Asia\/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and has in place a financial intelligence unit. Over the past two decades, Nauru has taken serious steps to reduce, prevent and suppress money laundering through the country and its financial institutions, thus addressing long-standing concerns. The reliance on illicit cash flows, to some degree, appears to have been substituted by greater reliance on foreign donors, Australia in particular. ","text - civil society and social protection":"Because of the small size of the country, it is likely that any victim- and witness-support mechanism would need to be outsourced to other Pacific island countries and Australia. Furthermore, due in part to the absence of organized criminal activity, victim- and witness-support structures in Nauru are not well developed. Prevention strategies pertaining to organized crime are largely absent for the same reasons, as are any civil society organisations working on issues related to organized criminal activity. Nevertheless, there are several advocacy groups for women, as well as development-focused and religious organizations that make up the wider civil-society landscape in Nauru.

The human-trafficking market in New Zealand is characterized predominantly by forced labour and sexual exploitation. Migrant communities are particularly vulnerable to exploitative practices, including debt bondage, in several sectors, including agriculture, construction and hospitality. Furthermore, there are known instances of migrant workers, primarily from South-eastern Asia, being subjected to debt bondage, physical violence, psychological abuse and the confiscation of their passports on fishing vessels that sail in New Zealand territorial waters under foreign flags. Female foreign nationals are primarily lured into New Zealand under false pretences of legitimate employment in industries such as the hospitality and beauty sectors, only to be forced to work in brothels or on chat websites. ##&& As with the human-trafficking market, the human-smuggling market in New Zealand is fairly limited. Although there are isolated cases of criminal actors providing fraudulent passports to foreign nationals in order to allow them entry to New Zealand, a culture of acceptance of immigration, strong border security and extremely low levels of corruption among border agencies in the country, combined, have thus far proven very successful in preventing organized-crime groups from taking hold of the human-smuggling market.","text - trade":"Until recently, New Zealand\u2019s relatively lax gun laws allowed huge numbers of privately owned firearms to remain unregistered. In the wake of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings, new legislation, together with a weapons amnesty, has reduced the number of firearms available and increased reporting and ownership obligations. Nevertheless, there is a risk that the tightening of gun laws may exacerbate the black market for small and light weapons. One pressing concern in New Zealand is the increasing availability of firearms to gangs.","text - environment":"The environmental-crime markets in New Zealand are very limited in scope and scale. The logging sector in the country is well regulated, including timber imports, and illegal logging cases are few and far between. Similarly, fauna crimes are uncommon, although seizures of illegal wildlife products at New Zealand\u2019s borders have increased substantially in recent years, suggesting the country\u2019s role as a transit or destination country is increasing in significance, in particular for the illegal trade in ivory. Domestically, native jewelled geckos are the primary target for poaching and illegal export, but such incidents remain small in number. On the other hand, there appear to be limited evidence to support the involvement of organized crime groups in the illicit extraction or trafficking of minerals or other non-renewable resources.","text - drugs":"The drug markets are the country\u2019s most pervasive organized criminal markets, particularly the synthetic-drug market. New Zealand is a destination country for methamphetamine originating primarily from North America, but also Central and Latin America. Domestic methamphetamine production, concentrated primarily on the North Island, appears to be on the rise. Organized-crime gangs are heavily involved in the methamphetamine market, in terms of both the manufacture and the importation of the drug. While the lower price of methamphetamine compared to certain other drugs in New Zealand suggests a high availability of the drug, it also likely indicates that no gang has a monopoly in the drug market. ##&& Cannabis is also widely cultivated in New Zealand and is thought to be the second most widely consumed drug, after methamphetamine. Organized-crime groups are heavily involved in cannabis supply chains in the country. The heroin and cocaine markets are far less pervasive in New Zealand, in terms of both use and the country\u2019s role in the transnational trade of the two drug types.","text - criminal actors":"The face of organized crime in New Zealand is mafia-style gangs \u2013 both traditional ethnic gangs and motorcycle gangs \u2013 and gang membership has been on the rise in recent years. While different groups have their own geographical strongholds and may be involved in various criminal enterprises, the common thread is drugs, methamphetamine in particular. These gangs have amassed criminal networks that extend across New Zealand and internationally. Such groups have considerable control over certain territories and there is mounting evidence that gang leaders are reorganizing and professionalizing gang structures across the country. As a result, the threat of inter-gang violence has heightened. While loose criminal networks are less pervasive, they are prevalent in certain criminal markets, such as the human-trafficking market, for example, and tend to be concentrated in New Zealand\u2019s cities. ##&& Foreign criminal actors \u2013 in particular cartels from Latin America \u2013 are heavily involved in the drug trade in New Zealand. However, foreign actors are most prevalent in the human-smuggling and human-trafficking markets, with unauthorized immigration brokers running their operations in source countries free of any oversight to provide fraudulent documentation and facilitate the onward exploitation of migrant workers in New Zealand. Conversely, state-embedded actors are the least prevalent types of criminal actors in the country. While isolated cases of attempted or actual infiltration or corruption within law enforcement agencies by organized criminal actors have been reported, there is no evidence to suggest that state-embedded actors are systematically involved in, or turn a blind eye to, organized crime in New Zealand.","text - leadership and governance":"New Zealand is among the most stable democracies in the world. The October 2020 re-election of Jacinda Ardern as prime minister, with a sizeable majority, reflects high levels of public trust in her administration, which has only been heightened by her effective handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has been vocal in its desire to combat transnational organized crime and has backed this up with increased investment for anti-organized crime efforts. Corruption levels in New Zealand are among the lowest in the world, thanks in large part to a robust rule of law and strong, independent oversight institutions. The country\u2019s anti-corruption legislation is solid and budget transparency is extensive. ##&& New Zealand is a party to all relevant international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, including the UNTOC and its three Palermo protocols, the UN Convention against Corruption and the UN\u2019s various conventions on narcotics and psychotropic substances. Furthermore, New Zealand\u2019s extradition procedures enable swift extradition even to countries with whom they have not signed a bilateral agreement. New Zealand plays a crucial role in regional cooperation on matters pertaining to organized crime, participating in a number of multilateral organizations and forums, and providing substantial assistance to Pacific island countries to tackle transnational organized crime. Domestically, the government has published a holistic transnational organized crime strategy, due to run from 2020 to 2025, which aims to detect and disrupt organized crime, placing a particular emphasis on prevention and capacity building. The country also has a robust legal framework covering several organized-crime types, including the Gangs and Organized Crime Bill introduced in 2009.","text - criminal justice and security":"New Zealand has an independent and well-functioning judiciary that is free from corruption and undue political influence. However, prosecution levels of organized crime offences are low and prosecution of human trafficking offences, in particular, have decreased in the past year. Furthermore, pre-trial detention has increased in recent years following the relaxation of length restrictions and the tightening of bail conditions. New Zealand\u2019s location as a remote island nation makes the country a popular destination for organized crime groups seeking to traffic various illegal commodities in the region. However, its isolation is also a natural barrier to certain forms of organized crime, such as human smuggling. Overall, law enforcement capacity is high, with a number of specialized anti-organized crime entities in place, including the Organised and Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand, the National Intelligence Centre and an anti-human trafficking operations group comprising immigration and law enforcement agencies to increase law enforcement cooperation.","text - economic and financial environment":"New Zealand has an extremely strong economy, relative to its size, and the regulatory environment in the country is robust and conducive to doing business. In 2019, prior to the pandemic, the unemployment rate reached its lowest level in over a decade and the informal sector in New Zealand as a share of national GDP is modest. However, the developed economy, strong regulatory and institutional frameworks, high degree of economic freedom and robust trade and communication infrastructure in the country also make it attractive to transnational organized criminals. Nevertheless, New Zealand remains a low-risk jurisdiction for money laundering and the government\u2019s anti-money laundering framework is effective.","text - civil society and social protection":"New Zealand has an active and diverse civil society. A number of non-governmental organizations work on issues related to organized crime, such as human trafficking support groups, and groups supporting drug rehabilitation. The media is an important component of civil society in the country, operating freely and capable of holding the government to account. ##&& The government and law enforcement agencies in New Zealand have placed significant importance on organized crime prevention efforts through the implementation of the national organized crime strategy, support for youth offenders and a focus on reducing recidivism rates. The government has continued to implement public awareness campaigns on issues relating to organized crime and has increased efforts to prevent human trafficking and illicit financial flows through public\u2013private partnerships. The government also provides training for law enforcement officials on treatment procedures for victims of human trafficking, but there is significant scope for improvement in government-led victim support services. With regard to drug use, the government has made important progress in its harm reduction strategy, including an early warning system designed to detect new or particularly harmful substances in the illicit drug market, in addition to a needle exchange programme and other measures.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Wellington","GDP (current $US million)":"206928.77","Income group":"High income","Population":"4979300","Land Area (sq. km)":"267710","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"18.4","Freedom in the World Index":"99","Human Development Index":"0.93","Global Peace Index":"1.20","Democracy Index":"9.25","Regime Type":"Full democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"88","GDP per capita (current US$)":"41558","1":"3.25","1.1":"3.25","1.2":"3.25","2":"8.38"},{"Corresp":"133","ISO-3":"PLW","Country":"Palau","ISO-2":"PW","Continent":"Oceania","Region":"Micronesia","Flag file":"pw.png","1.

A notable proportion of victims of human trafficking in Palau are foreign nationals, predominantly from Asia, who are lured to the country with false promises of high salaries. Nevertheless, given the small size of the country, human trafficking operations tend to be ad hoc and opportunistic, and are not run by highly sophisticated and organized criminal groups. The same can be said for the human smuggling market, as Palau plays a relatively minor role as a transit country. The market in the country is characterized for the most part by its facilitation of irregular migration through the provision of fraudulent documents or document theft, which suggests that corrupt practices may be present within the border force and customs authority.","text - trade":"There is no evidence to suggest there is an arms trafficking market in Palau. Importing and possessing guns are both strictly forbidden, and the number of small and light weapons in circulation in the country is extremely low. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that arms are trafficked across Palau\u2019s borders.","text - environment":"The illicit fauna market is the most pervasive criminal market in Palau, as a result of the high levels of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing taking place in the country\u2019s territorial waters. Illegal fishing by so-called \u2018blue boats\u2019 \u2013 small, wooden fishing boats from Vietnam \u2013 is rife, and weak maritime security allows it to continue unabated. Organized criminal activity in the fishing sector has detrimental impacts on the environment and people\u2019s livelihoods, and can create a spillover effect whereby local fishermen often have no choice but to engage in illegal fishing themselves or other forms of criminal activity. Flora and non-renewable resource crimes, conversely, are not prevalent at all and there is no evidence to suggest an organized criminal market for these exists in Palau.","text - drugs":"The drug markets in Palau are fairly limited as a whole, but cannabis consumption is widespread and local demand for methamphetamine is on the rise. Organized crime involvement in the domestic cannabis market is minimal, but organized criminal actors are heavily involved in Palau\u2019s primary role, namely in the transnational drug transit trade. Indeed, located on the Pacific drug route, Palau is primarily a transit country for cocaine and synthetic drugs transported from the Americas to Australia and New Zealand. Because the drugs are trafficked almost entirely on maritime routes, the impact of the drug trade on the local population is fairly minimal, and it is foreign criminal actors who benefit from the trade first and foremost. However, concerns have been raised regarding the involvement of fisherman in the illicit economy, for whom fishing is increasingly challenging as a result of depleted fish stocks, and who are often recruited into drug-trafficking organizations. These organizations are predominantly from Eastern and South-eastern Asia; the Philippines, in particular, is a key source country of crystal methamphetamine destined for Palau, either as a transit or destination country.","text - criminal actors":"The organized-crime landscape in Palau, limited though it is, is dominated primarily by loosely organized criminal structures comprising individual criminal entrepreneurs. As a transit country in the transnational drug trade, domestic criminal networks have developed connections with foreign actors operating in source regions and the most common destination countries. These foreign criminal actors, who hail predominantly from Eastern and South-eastern Asia, feature heavily in the drug trafficking market and are also responsible for the majority of the IUU fishing that occurs within Palau\u2019s territorial waters. Conversely, traditional mafia-style groups do not exist in the country and, while corrupt practices may exist, in particular with regard to IUU fishing, there is no evidence to suggest state-embedded actors are systematically involved in or facilitate organized crime.","text - leadership and governance":"In recent years, particularly since 2015, the government has stepped up its rhetoric against organized crime and, more specifically, the drug trade. Government ministers have called for assistance to combat drug trafficking, raising concerns that lack of resources is hindering its ability to tackle the issue. In 2019, Palau became the latest country to accede to the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its three Palermo protocols. The country has made good progress in recent years in the realm of international cooperation on the issue of organized crime, as exemplified by increased cooperation with other Pacific island countries on a variety of environmental and criminal matters via regional organizations, such as the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police, etc. ##&& Palau is also a signatory to the UN Convention against Corruption. Although nepotism, cronyism and the misappropriation of government funds have been flagged as issues in the country, instances of corruption are nevertheless isolated. In 2014, the government passed the Open Government Act, granting the public access to hearings and official documents. The Act also binds officials to annually submit publicly accessible financial statements. Overall, however, the legislative framework pertaining to access to information in Palau is poor. Furthermore, organized crime legislation is currently lacking, although efforts are under way to follow the example of other Pacific island countries to remedy the deficiencies in the country\u2019s legal framework.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judiciary in Palau is characterized by a high level of independence and integrity, yet suffers from overly bureaucratic and often inefficient processes. Nevertheless, the anti-human trafficking office within the Ministry of Justice is responsible for judicial investigations and prosecutions into human-trafficking offences. As a small island state, detention facilities in the country are limited \u2013 there is just one prison, the Koro Jail. Instances of abuse and impunity are rare, but overcrowding is problematic, with the prison registering an occupancy level of over 162%. Although the small police service in the country is well integrated with police services across the region, it requires assistance in forensics and intelligence matters, and is unlikely to cope with any surge in major crimes. In line with the threats facing the country, Palau has established a drug task force, the Narcotics Enforcement Agency, to tackle the issue of drug-trafficking. ##&& Palau\u2019s borders are porous and challenging to patrol, and its geographic position on the Pacific route, together with an extensive exclusive economic zone and limited border-control capacity, make tackling transnational organized crime difficult. However, Palau is part of the Pacific Islands Law Officers\u2019 Network, an independent organisation that consists of senior public law-enforcement officers and encourages cooperation. The country is also part of the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police, which includes national police officers and was established to develop a common approach to policing practices within the wider Pacific region and to train law enforcement agencies accordingly.","text - economic and financial environment":"Palau\u2019s economy is extremely limited and the environment is not particularly conducive to doing business. Banking and remittance services may be vulnerable to criminal exploitation, largely due to law enforcement agencies lacking the relevant expertise to regulate and enforce. The primary anti-money laundering legislation contains a number of deficiencies, in particular with regard to preventative measures such as financial transaction monitoring and asset seizure. An overarching issue is the lack of human, technical and financial resources within the country's Financial Institutions Commission. As such, like other Pacific island countries, Palau relies on assistance from foreign governments to conduct financial investigations.","text - civil society and social protection":"Generally, Palau is not regarded as a high-risk jurisdiction for organized criminal activity and, consequently, preventative measures are limited and specifically target certain illicit economies, such as drug trafficking and illegal fishing. The Narcotics Enforcement Agency, in particular, places prevention at the heart of its activity, but the government has also improved its prevention efforts in the field of human trafficking, primarily through the Human Trafficking Task Force. However, support systems for victims of human trafficking in Palau have several shortfalls, including the absence of a victim-identification tool and lack of funding for medical or psychological care for adult trafficking victims. ##&& In Palau, press freedom is generally observed and a number of independent media outlets function in the country, albeit under financial difficulties. Non-governmental organizations are free to operate, and many do in the fields of development, public health and environmental conservation, as well as in organized crime areas such as human trafficking, although to a lesser extent. Civil society organizations are involved in anti-human trafficking efforts and the protection of victims through the Human Trafficking Task Force. Moreover, the Palauan government and law enforcement structures have cooperated with NGOs and tech companies on an international level in the fight against illegal fishing.","Number of pages":"3","Capital":"Koror","GDP (current $US million)":"268.35","Income group":"High income","Population":"18008","Land Area (sq. km)":"460","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"","Freedom in the World Index":"92","Human Development Index":"0.83","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"","Regime Type":"","Corruption Perceptions Index":"","GDP per capita (current US$)":"14902","1":"2.94","1.1":"3.00","1.2":"2.88","2":"4.54"},{"Corresp":"135","ISO-3":"PNG","Country":"Papua New Guinea","ISO-2":"PG","Continent":"Oceania","Region":"Melanesia","Flag file":"pg.png","1.

Foreign actors play a significant role in the trafficking of people, primarily foreign nationals, predominantly in the aforementioned sectors. Furthermore, children not only make up a substantial proportion of the country\u2019s total labour force, but young girls are also trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation and forced marriage. Conversely, Papua New Guinea\u2019s role in the transnational human smuggling market is fairly limited, although it does play a role as a transit country for people being smuggled into Australia. Additionally, concerns have been voiced recently regarding the smuggling of individuals from Indonesia into Papua New Guinea.","text - trade":"Arms trafficking is a long-standing and serious issue in Papua New Guinea, with illegal weapons imports arming the criminal gangs who operate in the country. Much of the illegal arms trafficking occurs in the border areas between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, and in the region bordering the Torres Strait, which is shared with Australia. The influx of small arms and light weapons has increased levels of violence, in particular in the highlands, where automatic weapons, thought to originate in Indonesia, have led to a substantial rise in gun violence. The illegal arms trade is intertwined with a number of other criminal activities, as criminal networks often trade weapons for marijuana grown in Papua New Guinea, or exploit corruption within law enforcement to ensure the safe passage of weapons into the country.","text - environment":"Papua New Guinea has one of the world\u2019s largest rainforests, which is home to several hundreds of CITES-listed plant species, many of which, tropical hardwood trees in particular, are under threat from the illegal timber trade, which has proliferated in recent years. Foreign actors play a key role in the illegal timber sector, both in terms of the companies carrying out the illegal logging and as the most significant consumer market \u2013 as do state-embedded actors who facilitate the trade. Similarly, fauna crimes are pervasive throughout Papua New Guinea, particularly in the form of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which is rife in the country\u2019s territorial waters. Finally, Papua New Guinea is a major producer of gold and other precious metals, and the extractive industries are key contributors to the country\u2019s economy. Illegal mining is also common, in particular at the Porgera gold mine and the Panguna copper mine on Bougainville Island.","text - drugs":"The cannabis market is the most pervasive drug market in Papua New Guinea, as well as the country\u2019s most widely produced and consumed drug. While most of the cannabis cultivated in Papua New Guinea is for domestic use, a substantial proportion is smuggled out of the country, often with the involvement of foreign criminal actors, and in some cases in exchange for other illicit commodities, primarily small and light weapons. Papua New Guinea is also a trans-shipment point for both cocaine and synthetic drugs, originating in Latin America and South-eastern Asia, respectively, and destined for more lucrative markets such as Australia, with the Torres Strait being the most commonly used route. While domestic cocaine use is low, there are concerns that the prominence of methamphetamine in the wider Mekong region is leading to an increase in use of the drug in Papua New Guinea. Demand for heroin, on the other hand, remains low and there is no evidence to suggest Papua New Guinea plays anything other than a negligible role in the transnational heroin trade.","text - criminal actors":"Mafia-style groups do not operate in the country, and the criminal landscape in Papua New Guinea is dominated instead by tribal clans and street gangs. Loosely organized criminal networks are known as \u2018Raskols\u2019, and comprise a number of different street gangs, including the Bomai, 585s, the Mafia, KGK and Kips Kaboni. While these gangs operate throughout the country, they are primarily concentrated in the larger cities, such as Port Moresby and Lae. Tribal clans, conversely, operate first and foremost in the Highlands Region. These criminal networks are opportunistic and predominantly engage in petty crime such as burglary and carjacking. However, they are also involved in a number of organized illicit economies, including the drugs market, where criminal networks rely heavily on foreign criminal actor involvement. Levels of violence among street gangs in the country are extremely high, in large part due to the tribal nature of gang relations whereby the notion of revenge plays a fundamental role. These gangs are heavily armed, often making their own weapons as a result of the high cost of importing small and light weapons. ##&& Corrupt practices between criminal networks and local law enforcement and government officials are also prevalent. Corruption is pervasive in Papua New Guinea and while most instances of state-embedded corruption involve issues such as mismanagement of funds and fraud, rather than involvement in organized crime, corrupt practices are present in the highest levels of the state apparatus. Law enforcement agencies in Papua New Guinea are rife not only with corruption and misuse of public funds, but also with people involved directly in organized criminal activity, such as drug trafficking, the illegal arms trade and fuel theft. Political actors have developed strong ties with foreign companies known to have engaged in opaque operations in the extractive industries and the logging sector. Indeed, foreign criminal actors play a key role in a wide range of illicit economies in Papua New Guinea, including human trafficking, arms trafficking, environmental crime and the drugs market.","text - leadership and governance":"Politics in Papua New Guinea is characterized by high levels of instability, despite the progress made in recent years under the new administration, led by Prime Minister James Marape. The country experiences significant levels of violence among its communities in both cities and rural areas, and there is a notable lack of trust in the government and police. While the government has been increasingly vocal on the issue of drug trafficking, the most significant impediment to good governance, and thus the effective combating of transnational organized crime, is corruption, which is evident throughout all levels of the state apparatus and law enforcement. The current administration has, however, made concerted efforts to tackle corruption, including passing a bill legislating for the establishment of an Independent Commission against Corruption, and the publication of the National Policy for Transparency and Accountability in the Extractives Sector. ##&& Papua New Guinea does not appear to place much value on the ratification of international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime, as is evidenced by the country\u2019s absence from the list of state parties to the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its three Palermo protocols. This notwithstanding, Papua New Guinea does have close ties to its neighbours in the Pacific, most notably Australia, upon whom they rely for assistance on matters related to security and criminal justice. The country is also member of the Pacific Islands Forum and party to a number of regional security initiatives, such as the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police and the Pacific Transnational Crime Coordination Centre, among others. The domestic organized crime legal framework, however, is largely non-existent. Where laws are in place, they are outdated, in particular the country\u2019s drug laws. While legislation on criminal offences such as human trafficking and illegal logging exists, implementation is inadequate, as is the implementation of the limited number of national strategies put in place to combat organized crime.","text - criminal justice and security":"While the judicial system in Papua New Guinea is regularly put under pressure by governments, it remains generally independent. However, it is poorly resourced and as such suffers from lengthy detentions and trial delays. Although training \u043e\u043d anti-human trafficking has been provided to judicial officials, prosecutorial efforts in the area of human trafficking remain poor. As far as the detention system, prisons in Papua New Guinea are poorly maintained, under-resourced and severely overcrowded. Papua New Guinea has one of the highest rates of prison occupancy in Oceania and this has contributed to multiple episodes of prison violence and escapes. ##&& Papua New Guinea\u2019s geographic position between common source countries of illicit commodities and the large destination markets of Australasia makes the country an attractive transit location. The key factor in the country\u2019s vulnerability to transnational organized crime is its border with Indonesia, a crossing point for a number of illegal goods. Additionally, the state lacks legitimacy and reach in certain parts of the country, which further enhances Papua New Guinea\u2019s vulnerability to organized crime. Law enforcement\u2019s capacity to tackle organized criminal activity is likewise limited, largely due to a lack of resources, training and infrastructure: this, in spite of significant assistance from international partners, in the form of an INTERPOL National Central Bureau and a Transnational Crime Unit established with the support of the Australian Federal Police\u2019s Law Enforcement Cooperation Program as well as other regional security partnerships. Corrupt practices within law enforcement in the country are common, as is police brutality.","text - economic and financial environment":"Papua New Guinea\u2019s economy, the largest in Oceania after that of Australia and New Zealand, is heavily dependent on the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors, as well as the extractive industries. The informal sector in the country is extensive, with the overwhelming majority of the adult population employed in the informal economy. The economic regulatory environment on the whole is poor, with a number of deficiencies, including the ease of starting a business, contract enforcement and financial inclusion. While the risk of money laundering in Papua New Guinea is not as high as in many countries around the world, it is becoming an increasingly prominent issue. In recent years, however, the country has made strides to strengthen its anti-money laundering framework, including the introduction of the AML\/CTF Act 2015 and the establishment of the Financial Analysis Supervision Unit.","text - civil society and social protection":"The National Narcotics Bureau has stepped up its efforts to raise awareness around the issue of drug abuse in Papua New Guinea, and to control drug production and consumption, focusing particularly on awareness campaigns in schools. However, anti-trafficking prevention efforts are inadequate, and the government has failed to implement the national anti-trafficking plan, or to ensure proper training to relevant officials, or to improve regulations in sectors vulnerable to forced labour and exploitative practices. State support for victims of organized crime is extremely limited in Papua New Guinea, in particular with regard to victims of human trafficking. There is no witness protection scheme in place, which deters victims of organized crime and witnesses from reporting and testifying. Local civil society organizations provide most of the victim support services that are available, but lack of funding constrains their capacity. Churches are the most prominent components of civil society, but overall civil society in Papua New Guinea is fairly small, and even more so for NGOs working on issues pertaining to organized crime. The media environment in Papua New Guinea is relatively free and local media are at liberty to scrutinize and criticize the government, and to cover controversial topics such as police brutality and state corruption. Nevertheless, there have been isolated cases of targeted abuse towards journalists and there are concerns over the impartiality of media outlets, in particular the country\u2019s daily newspapers.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Port Moresby","GDP (current $US million)":"24829.11","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"8776109","Land Area (sq. km)":"462840","Geography type":"Coastal","Fragile States Index":"80.9","Freedom in the World Index":"62","Human Development Index":"0.56","Global Peace Index":"2.16","Democracy Index":"6.10","Regime Type":"Flawed democracy","Corruption Perceptions Index":"27","GDP per capita (current US$)":"2829","1":"5.44","1.1":"5.00","1.2":"5.88","2":"3.42"},{"Corresp":"145","ISO-3":"WSM","Country":"Samoa","ISO-2":"WS","Continent":"Oceania","Region":"Polynesia","Flag file":"ws.png","1.

The Samoan government has, nevertheless, warned of an increasing prevalence of human trafficking due to the country\u2019s proximity to popular destination countries such as Australia and New Zealand. While there have been isolated cases in recent years of Samoan nationals trafficked abroad for the purposes of forced labour, internal trafficking within Samoa is more common and victims of human trafficking are primarily exploited in the logging, fishing and mining sectors. With regard to the human smuggling market, Samoa similarly plays a negligible role, largely as a transit country, with only isolated cases of smuggler-facilitated irregular migration into the country.","text - trade":"Although there is evidence to suggest the arms trafficking market does exist in Samoa, its scope and scale is fairly limited. While firearms are associated with gang activity and the illicit drug trade, most firearm seizures by border agencies are of small arms and hunting rifles for personal use. Nevertheless, authorities in Samoa, together with those in neighbouring Pacific Island Countries (PIC), have expressed concern regarding the possible increasing prevalence of arms trafficking in the region.","text - environment":"There are few organized environmental crimes perpetrated in Samoa and the country plays a small role in the transnational trade of illegal wildlife products and non-renewable resources. Even though illegal logging is pervasive, it is mostly carried out by locals and there is no evidence to suggest organized criminal groups play any role in the market. Similarly, while Samoa faces a number of structural vulnerabilities to illegal fishing, the scale of the criminal market is small. Although isolated cases of illegal fishing by Samoan locals, primarily for subsistence, have been reported, the most significant vulnerability faced by the country is the threat of foreign vessels carrying out illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in Samoan waters. Finally, the Pacific Ocean surrounding Samoa\u2019s islands has a small number of mineral deposits, including cobalt, nickel and copper. Illicit extraction of sand has also been recorded in Samoa. However, there is no evidence to suggest organized criminal actors exploit these non-renewable resources.","text - drugs":"The most prominent drug market in Samoa is the cannabis market, which is the most popular drug in the country. Cultivated throughout the country, cannabis was initially dominated by criminal groups in the early 2010s, however, following a successful law enforcement response these groups began to recede. Nowadays, cannabis cultivation across the country is dominated by local entrepreneur-type individuals who grow the drug to satisfy the sizeable domestic demand. The cocaine market, on the other hand, is negligible, although there is some evidence to suggest that as cocaine traffickers increasingly transit through the PICs, Samoa is at risk of being used as a transit nation for cocaine trafficked from Latin America to Australia and New Zealand. Similarly, law enforcement in Samoa has reported an increase in the availability and use of synthetic drugs in recent years, in particular crystal methamphetamine, but the quantities remain minimal. There is no evidence to suggest the heroin market exists in Samoa.","text - criminal actors":"Given the extremely narrow organized crime landscape in Samoa, there are few organized crime actors operating in the country. The primary actors in Samoa\u2019s illicit economies are loose criminal networks comprising opportunistic criminal entrepreneurs. These actors would operate predominantly in the cannabis markets, but law enforcement disrupted operations at their peak between 2012-2015. However, even when these gangs were at their strongest, they did not conduct their operations with violence, nor did they extort businesses. Another feature of the criminal landscape is returnees, who have been deported from foreign countries, primarily New Zealand. These individuals are often involved in gang activity abroad, and then continue perpetrating criminal activity upon their return to Samoa. ##&& While corruption persists within the state apparatus in Samoa, there is some evidence to suggest government officials or other state-embedded actors are involved in illicit economies. Furthermore, Samoa is an extremely homogeneous country ethnically, restricting space for foreign criminal actors to operate. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to suggest foreign organized crime groups have been involved in moving drugs, primarily cocaine and crystal methamphetamine, into and through Samoa. Domestic mafia-style groups, conversely, do not exist in Samoa.","text - leadership and governance":"Samoa is on the whole fairly stable and democratic, and given the extremely limited scope of organized criminal activity, the phenomenon does not feature in the political debate in the country. While corruption is by no means endemic in Samoa, it is an issue and a cause of public discontent, with several instances of corruption coming to light in recent years. While there is no anti-corruption tribunal established in the country, there are a number of bodies tasked with pursuing allegations of corruption in Samoa. However, there is still much room for improvement as far as government transparency is concerned; there is no access to information law in place in Samoa and journalists are frequently barred from entering parliament to cover proceedings. ##&& With regard to foreign relations, Samoa\u2019s framework for international cooperation generally, and on matters pertaining to organized crime more specifically, is fairly robust. The country is party to a number of relevant treaties and conventions, including the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, although it has not yet signed or ratified its three Palermo protocols. International cooperation is strongest with Samoa\u2019s neighbours in the Pacific Ocean, in particular via the Pacific Transnational Crime Coordination Centre, which is based in Samoa, a law enforcement-led initiative focusing on combating transnational organized crime and other regional bodies, such as the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police and the Pacific Islands Forum. While Samoa does have an extradition act in place, it is limited in practice; conversely, Samoa has legislation in place regarding mutual legal assistance on criminal matters, and assistance can be provided regardless of whether a bilateral treaty exists. Samoa also has a fairly robust legal framework as it pertains to organized crime. The Crimes Act 2013 criminalizes participation in an organized crime group, as well as a number of specific forms of organized crime, including money laundering, corruption, the smuggling of migrants and the trafficking of people. However, the drug laws, as laid out in the Narcotics Act 1967, are extremely outdated and in need of reform.","text - criminal justice and security":"On the whole, the judicial system in Samoa is considered independent, but in 2020, the government introduced a bill to parliament that would give the executive the power to dismiss judges without grounds or due process, thus undermining the democratic principle of the separation of powers and threatening judicial independence. Furthermore, the prison system in Samoa is in need of severe improvement, as issues such as overcrowding and an under-resourced staff threaten the security of the country\u2019s penal institutions. ##&& Given Samoa\u2019s small population and the limited extent of criminality, the national police force is fairly small. While there is no domestic law enforcement unit focusing specifically on organized crime, a Transnational Crime Unit has been established through the Pacific Transnational Crime Network, a multi-agency initiative, supported by the governments of Australia and New Zealand, established to combat transnational crime in the Pacific. Samoa relies on international assistance, in particular on border security, which is of great importance, given Samoa\u2019s geographic characteristics as an island state that lies between two prominent regions with illicit economies, South-eastern Asia and Australasia. Overall, trust in law enforcement in Samoa is fairly high, and while there have been cases of bribery, corruption and police brutality, these have been isolated and condemned by senior figures in the police service.","text - economic and financial environment":"The Samoan economy is reliant on agriculture and tourism, the latter suffering greatly from the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the economic regulatory environment is fairly conducive to doing business, there is a considerable segment of society who lack access to formal financial services, in particular those employed in the agricultural sector. This exacerbates the urban-rural divide in Samoa, with a large percentage of the labour force is compelled to engage in the informal economy. Because of Samoa's small economy and banking sector, the country is not perceived as a haven for money laundering. The country was, however, put on the EU's non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes list in 2017. On the whole, Samoa has made progress in strengthening its anti-money laundering framework. Two key steps that direction have been the formation and launch of a financial intelligence unit and the passing of the Money Laundering Prevention Amendment Act of 2018. Nevertheless, even though the country has the legal instruments to tackle money laundering, its investigative and prosecutorial capabilities have been somewhat inhibited by the lack of resources.","text - civil society and social protection":"Although Samoa is a member of several international groups that collaborate on combatting and preventing organized crime, and law enforcement has emphasized community policing, given the limited organized crime landscape in the country, the government\u2019s organized crime prevention framework is fairly insubstantial. Furthermore, the country\u2019s victim support measures are minimal, in particular with regards to drug abuse. Personnel for administering drug abuse treatment is inadequate and drug treatment facilities are poor. With regards to judicial proceedings, witnesses are afforded protection and measures such as providing evidence via video link are in place. Finally, Samoa is a welcoming environment for civil society organizations (CSO), but the limited scope of organized criminal activity in the country is reflected in the dearth of CSOs focusing specifically on organized crime. Although criminal libel was reintroduced in 2017, the press environment in Samoa is largely free, with an increasing number of print and broadcast media outlets operating unhindered, in part as a result of the substantial growth of internet access.","Number of pages":"3","Capital":"Apia","GDP (current $US million)":"852.25","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"197097","Land Area (sq. km)":"2840","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"64.2","Freedom in the World Index":"81","Human Development Index":"0.72","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"","Regime Type":"","Corruption Perceptions Index":"","GDP per capita (current US$)":"4324","1":"2.04","1.1":"2.45","1.2":"1.63","2":"5.67"},{"Corresp":"156","ISO-3":"SLB","Country":"Solomon Islands","ISO-2":"SB","Continent":"Oceania","Region":"Melanesia","Flag file":"sb.png","1.

Reportedly, Solomon Islanders are becoming victims of forced labour abroad, but people smuggled into the country are vulnerable to forced labour as well, primarily in the logging industry, but also fishing. Women in the Solomon Islands, many of whom are underage, come into the country as irregular migrants and are forced into prostitution, working around logging camps. Corruption plays a significant role in sex and labour trafficking, as there are reports of complicity at various levels of the state. ##&& A significant proportion of trafficking victims in the Solomon Islands initially arrive as irregular migrants smuggled from South-eastern and Eastern Asia, including China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and North Korea.","text - trade":"The country has seen a massive reduction in the prevalence of small arms and light weapons since the commencement of the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands and its Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration programme. Currently, gun ownership levels are low, but there are reports of arms trafficking between the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea\u2019s Bougainville Island. Arms trafficking seems to ebb and flow in both directions because of the poorly monitored maritime borders.","text - environment":"The Solomon Islands rely heavily on timber with over 50% of its exports coming from logging. Reports indicate that much of this billion-dollar industry is illegal. This is predominantly due to the involvement of transnational corporations from China and Malaysia abusing quotas and avoiding regulations, and shipping about two thirds of their harvest to China. In addition, state actors are known to engage in bribery and other corrupt practices, facilitating illicit logging. Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is also a serious issue as territorial waters are highly vulnerable. Similar to flora crimes, IUU fishing is mostly perpetrated by foreign fleets, originating in Vietnam and China. Corruption is key to allowing foreign actors to operate free of government interference. Poaching levels of rare and endangered turtle species in the Solomon Islands are also concerning. Turtle shells are used by carvers and jewellery-makers and sold domestically, although local buyers are known to sell to buyers throughout Asia. The country is also rich in gold and minerals, which until recently were exploited to a minimal extent. Increased mining activities may come with a heightened risk of corruption and criminal involvement in the country, which has demonstrated limited capacity in the management of natural-resource wealth. Nevertheless, the government plans to tap into natural resources as a potential source of economic development.","text - drugs":"Although demand is low and there is limited evidence of a domestic cocaine market, there are indications that the Solomon Islands is a major transit point for cocaine destined for Australia and New Zealand. Conversely, there is neither local demand, nor transit routes for heroin going through the Solomon Islands or its territorial waters. ##&& It is arguable that a domestic market for cannabis exists in the country, and demand is seemingly satisfied by cannabis farms inside the country, implying the involvement of domestic actors. No concrete evidence supports the presence of a synthetic drugs market in the Solomon Islands. There is, however, the heightened risk of a spillover effect in the sense that availability of synthetic drugs in the region might contribute to the development of such a market locally. In addition, the country is at risk of becoming a transit zone for methamphetamine destined for Australia and New Zealand.","text - criminal actors":"State-embedded actors appear to be the most prominent criminal actor type in the Solomon Islands. There is evidence of their involvement in illicit logging, fishing and gambling\/prostitution at different levels and in close cooperation with private entities involved in these activities. The issue stems predominantly from clientelism and the fact that state actors are able to direct resources towards specific agents, mostly by awarding concessions and contracts to companies. Closely linked to that, foreign actors \u2013 mostly companies \u2013 are the main beneficiaries of the support of state-embedded actors. These entities originate mostly in East and South-east Asian countries and are primarily involved in illegal logging and IUU fishing. It is likely that foreign actors are also making use of the close proximity between large drugs markets, such as Australia and New Zealand, and the Solomon Islands, using the latter as a transit hub. ##&& Reports of criminal networks operating in the Solomon Islands are not widespread, however, their existence seems probable. These are arguably involved to some extent in facilitating human trafficking as well as in fauna crimes and the trafficking of arms. Establishing how widespread criminal networks are is difficult, but a likely hypothesis is that they operate around \u2018hubs\u2019, such as logging camps, cities and the porous border area with Bougainville Island. It is reasonable to suggest criminal networks have links to foreign actors. There is no evidence to back the existence of mafia-style groups in the Solomon Islands. Those closest to this definition were the so-called \u2018raskol\u2019 gangs, but rather than evolving into actual mafia groups, they were unable to develop a clear command structure or maintain group membership.","text - leadership and governance":"Although the integrity of political process, political pluralism and freedom of media are respected, corruption seems to be a significant issue in the Solomon Islands, taking many forms. Bribe rates appear high across the country and grand corruption is a major concern. Parties revolve around kinship and clan ties and the Solomon Islands appear to be caught in a \u2018clientelism trap\u2019, where politicians funnel funding locally, towards their immediate clients or embezzle state funds, rather than directing them towards building a well-functioning institutional framework. Corruption issues are endemic in the natural-resource sectors \u2013 fisheries, logging and non-renewable resources \u2013 with companies frequently bribing or offering kickbacks to politicians. Nevertheless, steps have been taken at a national level to address the issue. One such measure has been the adoption of anti-corruption legislation in 2018, which established the Independent Commission Against Corruption. While an important step in the right direction, these measures have their limitations and further anti-corruption efforts are needed. Although an independent ombudsman's office and an auditor general are operational in the country, a lack of funding hinders their work. Following the ethnic violence that ended in 2003, group grievances have reduced, although there are still occasional flare-ups of civil unrest. ##&& The Solomon Islands is party to the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora but has not signed or ratified other international treaties and conventions pertaining to organized crime. Nevertheless, the country has been a member of INTERPOL since 2017. The organization has a National Central Bureau in Honiara and is mostly engaged in capacity building as well as providing intelligence and facilitating intelligence exchange with partner countries in the region. Additionally, the Solomon Islands cooperates with other island nations via a number of regional security initiatives, including the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police, and others. Overall, international cooperation has been key in the country better policing its borders and in rebuilding its judicial system in the post-conflict period. Still, laws related to organized crime are poor, even by regional standards, and need to be updated in order to adequately respond to modern threats.","text - criminal justice and security":"The justice sector in the Solomon Islands is best described as a hybrid of formal and informal institutions, with community leaders, for the most part, regarded as the most accessible, fair and efficient means of resolving disputes. Although improvement in the work of the formal judicial system is evident, prosecution services, for instance, still lack capacity and resources to work efficiently. Both the judicial system and law enforcement have benefited significantly from the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) and the subsequent bilateral Solomon Islands Justice Program. However, there are still substantial issues in the justice system that need to be addressed. Although standards in law enforcement have been raised and training is considered good, a lack of funding persists. The penal system has also benefited from international funding, despite evidence suggesting that prisons are still underfunded. Along with the investment in facilities, international donors recognize the need for leadership and management capacity building as well as an increased focus on rehabilitation. Justice as well as governance in general are heavily influenced by geographical constraints, making it difficult for institutions to exercise sovereignty equally throughout the country. Along these lines, the vast maritime borders are difficult to police and are vulnerable to illegal flows.","text - economic and financial environment":"Money laundering risks in the Solomon Islands stem primarily from proceeds generated from illegal logging, IUU fishing and related corruption practices. Reports indicate that these risks are either not properly accounted for or the policy framework to address them is inadequate. No steps have been taken on the part of authorities to close these gaps. There is an operational financial intelligence unit, but money laundering offences are rarely the subject of investigation, often taking a backseat to predicate offences, while supervision of private actors, such as financial institutions or NGOs, has been limited or non-existent. The Solomon Islands also faces structural constraints to economic development. The country\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on the export of primary goods, especially timber, and lacks diversification and sophistication. In addition, the country\u2019s economic regulatory framework makes doing business in the Solomon Islands extremely difficult. Youth disenfranchisement in politics, society and the economy has on occasion led to riots, often targeting the property of those who benefit from the status quo. Labour participation rates are low, leaving young people in particular vulnerable to criminality of a mostly petty nature.","text - civil society and social protection":"The police reportedly operate a shelter for victims of violence, which can be used to house victims of sex trafficking. Specialized facilities for victims and witnesses, however, are lacking, and the police are unable to adequately protect witnesses, particularly the most vulnerable. A nationwide crime prevention strategy is being implemented, with crime prevention committees set up across various locations in the country. Intentions are for the committees to enable the police to focus on prevention and on a proactive response to crime issues. Other prevention measures, such as awareness-raising workshops focussed on youth, are also being implemented. Press freedom is for the most part respected, although government officials have, on occasion, used both legal and extra-legal measures to coerce journalists. A whistle-blower protection act was adopted in 2018, which is expected to further promote independent reporting on issues facing the country, in particular corruption. However, the defamation law continues to cast a shadow over media and contributes to self-censorship. Civil society has been relatively active in the Solomon Islands, including on matters related to crime. Organized sport, churches and affiliated youth groups have had a positive impact on crime reduction, making it difficult for gangs to institutionalize in urban settlements.","Number of pages":"4","Capital":"Honiara","GDP (current $US million)":"1589.91","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"669823","Land Area (sq. km)":"28900","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"79.3","Freedom in the World Index":"79","Human Development Index":"0.57","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"","Regime Type":"","Corruption Perceptions Index":"42","GDP per capita (current US$)":"2374","1":"4.15","1.1":"3.55","1.2":"4.75","2":"5.21"},{"Corresp":"175","ISO-3":"TON","Country":"Tonga","ISO-2":"TO","Continent":"Oceania","Region":"Polynesia","Flag file":"to.png","1.

While Tongan men tend to be trafficked to countries like Australia and New Zealand for the purposes of forced labour, Tongan women and children are susceptible to being victimized and exploited in domestic servitude and sexual exploitation, both locally and abroad. With regard to the trafficking of foreign nationals in Tonga, East Asian women, primarily Chinese nationals, have been trafficked to Tonga for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Meanwhile, there is little evidence that smuggling of migrants to or from Tonga is a major issue.","text - trade":"Tonga is considered a transit country for arms trafficking, with an ever-increasing volume of firearms passing through it. With its traditional linkage to the US, in particular Hawaii, shipments of firearms into and through Tonga often originate in the US. To a lesser extent, illicit arms shipments also originate in China and Latin American ports. Arms trafficking has potential links with drug trafficking operations, as there have been cases in which firearms and illegal ammunition have been transported in the same shipments. ##&& There are concerns that an increasing frequency of arms trafficking in Tonga, and the related corruption payments, will impact community safety. Customs officials and governmental inspection services have been identified as receiving payments to facilitate the arms trade, with bribes for safe entry into the country reaching the higher echelons of the authorities.","text - environment":"Environmental crimes in Tonga are of a limited scale and scope. Tonga has little forest over its 170 islands and, as such, illicit logging is unlikely. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest non-renewable resource crimes occur in the country. Conversely, illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is substantial in Tonga\u2019s territorial waters, although IUU fishing activities have not been recorded and addressed as extensively as in the other islands.","text - drugs":"The criminal market for drugs continues to be the most consolidated and pervasive in Tonga, a country that serves as a transit point for cocaine and methamphetamines bound for Australia and New Zealand. Methamphetamines, known in Tonga as \u2018tutu\u2019, are arguably the largest drug market in the country and a number of large-scale seizures in recent years indicate that substantial amounts of methamphetamine pass through it. The criminal market for cocaine is also quite significant, and Tonga, as is the case with a number of other Pacific island countries, is situated along the Pacific cocaine trafficking route. The route\u2019s significance and the volume of cocaine transiting through Tonga is believed to have increased since 2014. This can be attributed to the growth of the consumption of cocaine in Australia and New Zealand, which has been driving the trade in the region. ##&& With this drugs transit trade through Tonga, there has been increasing domestic consumption of narcotics, and as a result, it is becoming a small-scale destination market in its own right. Cases have been reported of seized shipments of methamphetamine destined for Tonga, and reports of a growing methamphetamine trade in Nuku\u2019alofa have emerged. The presence of some small-scale, rudimentary laboratories producing methamphetamines of inferior quality has also been documented. ##&& In addition to the criminal markets for synthetic drugs and cocaine, there is evidence of a substantial consumer base for cannabis in Tonga. Domestic use of the drug has increased in recent years. This demand is partly fed by cannabis being brought into the country from the US and partly by an allegedly growing domestic production on remote Tongan islands. Lastly, there is only limited evidence of demand for heroin in Tonga, but the dynamics of the small-scale market remain obscure.","text - criminal actors":"The main types of criminal actors in Tonga appear to be foreign organized criminal groups. Nationals from China have been implicated in human trafficking, while drug trafficking organizations in North and South America, as well as Eastern Asia, are responsible for trafficking drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines into and through Tonga. ##&& While foreign criminal actors tend to dominate many criminal markets, they often interact with Tongan criminal networks. In some cases, Tongan criminal network members who have been deported from other countries maintain the connections they established abroad and continue to engage in criminality in their home country. Although there is little evidence to suggest state-embedded actors are directly involved in the running of any criminal market, there have been a number of reported cases of corruption within the state apparatus, with allegations of drug trafficking, fraud, bribery and money laundering levelled at the mid and high levels of state structures. ","text - leadership and governance":"Commitment to combating organized crime has varied between Tongan administrations, with the main project of the current prime minister, Pohiva Tu'i'onetoa, being to unify a politically divided nation. However, anti-organized crime measures are generally reactive across pacific island states, rather than proactive, driven from the outside. Corruption is a significant issue in Tonga and the country\u2019s integrity systems are not adequately resourced safeguards against it. ##&& The national legal framework is assessed as adequate to respond to current organized crime threats and includes acts on countering transnational organized crime, arms trafficking and IUU fishing. Tonga has signed and ratified all the relevant treaties on organized crime and corruption, except the three accompanying protocols to the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime. Tonga cooperates with other countries via an INTERPOL National Central Bureau as well as through regional structures, including the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Transnational Crime Network, the Pacific Transnational Crime Coordination Centre and the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police that work to combat illicit economies and serious organized crime in the pacific region. Finally, the country is a beneficiary of substantial international assistance and law enforcement capacity-building measures.","text - criminal justice and security":"While there remains significant scope for improvement, law enforcement in Tonga is fairly effective. A national drug enforcement task force has been established and the country engages in substantial regional cooperation on law enforcement matters, including collaboration with the Transnational Serious and Organized Crime Pacific Taskforce. Although there have been allegations of corruption made against the Tongan police in past years, independent civilian oversight over the police is exercised by the national ombudsman. ##&& One of the biggest current criminal justice concerns in Tonga is the relatively large number of Tongan nationals who are deported to the country. The lack of notification of deportations from other countries has overwhelmed the resources Tonga has allocated to deportees, which has sparked concerns that many deportees could become re-offenders in Tonga. Indeed, prisons have been identified as hotbeds for the drug trade, specifically methamphetamines. Another concern is the difficulty of monitoring the country\u2019s vast territory around remote islands; however, evidence suggests that Tonga deals with these challenges reasonably well.","text - economic and financial environment":"In addition to tourism and agriculture, remittances and foreign aid are important sources of income for Tonga. Although significant challenges persist with regard to the ease of doing business, largely owing to excessive bureaucracy and weak legal protections, the country\u2019s economy is relatively open, and the government has expressed a desire to continue to develop the private sector.

Similarly, human smuggling is a relatively limited phenomenon in Tuvalu. As part of the Commonwealth, Tuvalu citizens enjoy a number of legal mobility opportunities and, although it is a poor country, there are few incentives to hire human smugglers.","text - trade":"There is no evidence of arms trafficking taking place in Tuvalu, largely because the country is neither strategically attractive nor economically permeable. Illicit firearms are not known to be in circulation in Tuvalu and the national police do not carry firearms.","text - environment":"Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is the most pervasive environmental criminal market in Tuvalu, although the scale of the market is manageable. However, given the country\u2019s heavy reliance on fishing revenues, IUU fishing might have a significant effect on Tuvalu if left unaddressed. In fact, less than 1% of Tuvalu\u2019s exclusive economic zone is declared a marine protected area. Illicit trade pertaining to flora species or non-renewable resources, on the other hand, are virtually non-existent.","text - drugs":"The illicit markets for drugs appear limited in size. There is a steady and moderate demand for cannabis in Tuvalu but the supply of domestically grown cannabis is enough to feed this demand. Nevertheless, there is limited or no evidence to suggest any organized criminal involvement in any of the other drug markets in Tuvalu.","text - criminal actors":"With the exception of the illicit fauna trade, organized crime is negligible in Tuvalu and the presence of organized criminal groups is by extension almost non-existent. There are no mafia-style groups or loose criminal networks operating in the country. Similarly, there is limited evidence to suggest state-embedded actors exert influence on specific criminal markets. As the actor type monopolizing the largest criminal market in Tuvalu, albeit limited on a global comparison, foreign actors are most dominant in the country.","text - leadership and governance":"Tuvalu\u2019s government has been relatively disengaged from anti-organized crime efforts, largely because organized crime is not considered among the primary challenges facing the country (unlike, for instance, the effect of climate change). Tuvalu is generally regarded as a free and well-functioning democracy with consolidated civil liberties and, while corruption is an issue, legal and institutional safeguards against it are generally fit for purpose. Additionally, there are regional agreements in place, to which Tuvalu is party, aiming to improve transparency and accountability in the fishing industry. ##&& As a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and as a partner to a number of regional and bilateral agreements with the US and Australia, Tuvalu has a positive record in terms of cooperation, information and intelligence sharing on issues such as anti-money laundering, human smuggling and IUU fishing. Tuvalu cooperates within the framework of a number of regional law-enforcement cooperation networks and has entered into shiprider agreement with Australia and the US. At the same time, Tuvalu has not yet signed, ratified or acceded to a number of treaties pertaining to organized crime, including the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime or any of its protocols (though it has legislation reflecting obligations set out in these instruments). The country has, however, ratified the 2013 Arms Trade Treaty and acceded to the UN Convention against Corruption. ##&& Tuvalu\u2019s national legislation is in place and adapted to the needs of the state. The country's legislation criminalizes several acts related to transnational organized crime. Piracy and maritime crime are criminalized by the Tuvalu Penal Code, while IUU fishing is criminalized with specially dedicated legislation. One remaining issue is that of child labour, which, while limited in scope, continues to be practised in the country.","text - criminal justice and security":"Tuvalu has an independent and effective judiciary, which respects due legal process. Tuvalu\u2019s detention system (consisting of one jail on the Fongafale islet off Funafuti) hosts between eight and 12 inmates at any given time and is believed to be well resourced. There are no reports of abuse in detention centres. ##&& Tuvalu has no military force, but the national police force headquartered in Funafuti cooperates with neighbouring states to counter criminal networks and organizations on its territory. Tuvalu does not have a specific or designated transnational organized crime police or intelligence unit, apart from the Maritime Surveillance Unit of the police, which has been successful in monitoring IUU fishing. Given its status as an island and islet microstate, Tuvalu\u2019s maritime borders are hard to monitor and police. Maritime borders are naturally porous, which is why the country relies on law-enforcement collaboration across the Pacific region. Overall, Tuvalu is able to defend its territorial integrity relatively well, given its limited resources.","text - economic and financial environment":"Tuvalu is economically dependent on external sources of revenue, such as remittance payments, foreign assistance, fishing licences, small-scale exports and resale of rights to international telephone codes to the gambling industry. Tuvalu\u2019s GDP (gross domestic product) growth is one of the strongest in the region, but economic growth is concentrated in the capital of Funafuti, leaving prospects for private-sector development limited in many parts of the country. ##&& With regard to money laundering, Tuvalu's implementation of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) standards has not yet been assessed by a mutual evaluation report. The country holds an observer to the Asia\/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) but has not made any effort to join the ranks of full membership. Notwithstanding, the APG has welcomed Tuvalu\u2019s overall efforts to strengthen its AML\/CFT system, which most recently has included the establishment of a Transaction Tracking Unit (a financial intelligence unit).","text - civil society and social protection":"Tuvalu is not sufficiently equipped to support victims of crime. While on the one hand, there are laws covering the full range of violent crimes, including legal provisions giving victim compensation and the legal representation of victims, there are no adult protective victim services in place in Tuvalu. Tuvalu has been criticized for child-labour practices, and child protective victim services have only recently been established. Tuvalu has no action plans, national frameworks or other strategies in place for organized crime prevention. This, however, should be seen in the light of the country's low-crime rates and what appears to be the absence of organized crime groups of any significant size. ##&& Civil liberties and personal freedoms are generally respected in Tuvalu and the country has a relatively vibrant civil society active in areas such as good governance and transparency, conservation, public health and human rights. Journalists and media outlets enjoy a great deal of freedom and independence from intimidation, with no reports of restrictions imposed by political interests.","Number of pages":"3","Capital":"Funafuti","GDP (current $US million)":"47.27","Income group":"Upper middle income","Population":"11646","Land Area (sq. km)":"30","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"","Freedom in the World Index":"93","Human Development Index":"","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"","Regime Type":"","Corruption Perceptions Index":"","GDP per capita (current US$)":"4059","1":"1.54","1.1":"1.70","1.2":"1.38","2":"6.04"},{"Corresp":"188","ISO-3":"VUT","Country":"Vanuatu","ISO-2":"VU","Continent":"Oceania","Region":"Melanesia","Flag file":"vu.png","1.

Vanuatu is believed to be a transit country for human trafficking from South-eastern Asia to Fiji and anecdotal evidence indicates that foreign and domestic actors are involved in human trafficking. Within the country, domestic or foreign victims might be trafficked from one island to another for sexual or labour exploitation. In one of the biggest cases in recent years, 100 Bangladeshi men and two children were trafficked to work for a South African retail company in Vanuatu. In 2021, Vanuatu was in the spotlight for selling passports to foreign citizens in 2020, allowing them, including several individuals with alleged connections to organized crime and illicit activity, visa-free access to the United Kingdom and the EU. Nevertheless, the local impact of the 'golden passport' scheme was likely limited in scope.","text - trade":"There is no evidence to suggest the presence of an arms-trafficking market in Vanuatu, with few illicit arms in circulation in the country.","text - environment":"Environmental crimes continue to be the most widespread form of organized criminal activity in Vanuatu. Illegal logging operations are reported to occur and case evidence suggests that the actors involved in the market operate locally and include public servants and landowners among others. For instance, in 2018, there were reports of commercial illegal logging activities in the largest conservation area in the country - Big Bay, Matantas. Additionally, there have been unconfirmed reports of the processing of rosewood, most likely destined for the Chinese furniture market. ##&& Despite the country having declared close to a quarter of its exclusive economic zone marine protected areas, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing persists and is the main fauna crime in Vanuatu. The main source of vulnerability is foreign vessels operating in the nearby waters without proper authorization. On the other hand, there is no organized crime market surrounding non-renewable resources.","text - drugs":"In general, Vanuatu\u2019s exposure to criminal drug markets is limited and it mostly functions as a transit country. However, there is a market for cannabis, with demand being domestically generated, and, in recent years, a small market for methamphetamines has emerged. In the case of cannabis, demand is predominantly satisfied by cannabis of domestic origin, although local police report that cannabis in small quantities is imported from nearby countries, such as Tonga. ##&& Local authorities report that there have been cases of cocaine traffickers (and, less often, heroin traffickers), who take the drugs through Vanuatu to destinations such as Australia or New Zealand, posing as tourists. In some cases, cocaine has been smuggled on luxury yachts docking in Vanuatu. There is some evidence that there is limited local demand for synthetic drugs and that some people in the country have the capacity to produce small batches of methamphetamine. In May 2016, a methamphetamine manufacturing facility was dismantled in Port Vila in Vanuatu.","text - criminal actors":"The dominant criminal actor type in Vanuatu is foreign actors. There are no reports of domestically rooted organized criminal networks or mafia-style groups. Corruption among Vanuatu officials is an issue, but the forms of corruption in the country are predominantly graft, embezzlement and petty corruption, as evidenced by the 'golden passport' scheme, which was exposed in early 2021. Evidence suggests that foreign criminals participate in human trafficking. In 2018, several foreign actors were arrested for trafficking 100 Bangladeshi nationals to Vanuatu. Fishing crimes most likely involve foreigners and there have been cases of Chinese fraud scammers using Vanuatu as a base for operations.","text - leadership and governance":"Organized crime is not considered a major issue in Vanuatu and, for this reason, it remains a low priority on the government agenda. The government and the opposition rarely communicate any strategies or campaigns to combat particular types of organized crime and measures are reactive, rather than proactive. There have not been cases of the international community raising concerns about the topic. The legal framework in Vanuatu criminalizes transnational human trafficking, human smuggling, arms trafficking and various drug offences. Meanwhile, the debate on legalizing cannabis continues. Abuse of office and corruption are a problem, but the judiciary, the office of the ombudsman, and other anti-corruption institutions safeguard against corruption by holding elected officials accountable in high-profile cases. Although corruption remains a problem, Vanuatu consistently performs well above the average for the Asia-Pacific region on the Corruption Perceptions Index. Although right-to-information mechanisms exists, accessing public information remains difficult due to costliness and excessive bureaucracy. ##&& Vanuatu has ratified the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime but is yet to ratify the Palermo protocols. Vanuatu joined INTERPOL in 2018 and is a member of a number of regional security organizations and law-enforcement networks. Despite these efforts, experts have argued that accession to international treaties has been driven from the outside, and implementation is problematic. On the other hand, there are continuous collaborative efforts with the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, the Australian Federal Police, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, as well as a shiprider agreement with the US. Vanuatu is also a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, through which it collaborates on matters of security with other countries in the region. Most recently, member states signed the Boe Declaration on Regional security, which emphasizes human and environmental security, as well as transnational crime and cybercrime.","text - criminal justice and security":"The judiciary in Vanuatu operates with independence, integrity and impartiality, but there is evidence that courts suffer from a backlog in cases, sometimes resulting in long detention periods. Prisons in Vanuatu tend to suffer from overcrowding, and poor conditions and management. As a result, violence and escapes happen on a frequent basis and are a cause for concern. Another law enforcement issue in Vanuatu is monitoring the country\u2019s borders because of the high number of smaller islands (the archipelago is made up of more than 80 islands, of which 65 are inhabited). These geographical features make the country vulnerable to exploitation by traffickers and smugglers who wish to transit in Vanuatu. ##&& Law enforcement in Vanuatu has a number of specialized units that work to counter organized crime, including the Serious Crimes Unit, the Drugs Unit, the Crime Prevention Unit and the Maritime Wing of the police, as well as the Transnational Crime Unit in the National Intelligence Unit. ","text - economic and financial environment":"The private sector in Vanuatu faces a number of constraints, including complex and non-transparent bureaucratic procedures, rigid labour laws that prevent a formal labour market from developing and mismanagement of subsidized state-owned enterprises. Vanuatu continues to be non-compliant with international anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) standards. The country is an offshore tax haven with secrecy laws, which do not allow authorities to access information about beneficial ownership of entities, except under a court order. The country\u2019s financial system is exposed to laundering of criminal proceeds from corruption, fraud, drug offences, tax evasion and other crimes. Although it has made some progress against the Financial Action Task Force criteria, it continues to appear on the European Council\u2019s list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions because it has not delivered on its commitments since the first blacklist was adopted in 2017.","text - civil society and social protection":"There is little information on the framework for victim- and witness-protection procedures in Vanuatu. The police force has a unit focused on crime prevention, but it has not published a strategy. The space for civil society and media in Vanuatu is generally respected and a number of civil society organizations focus on crime-related issues. One of these is the non-governmental organization, Campaign for Justice, which has investigated illegal logging in the country's largest conservation area. The right to free speech and critical journalism is generally upheld, though there have, in the past, been isolated cases of intimidation of journalists.","Number of pages":"3","Capital":"Port Vila","GDP (current $US million)":"934.24","Income group":"Lower middle income","Population":"299882","Land Area (sq. km)":"12190","Geography type":"Island","Fragile States Index":"","Freedom in the World Index":"82","Human Development Index":"0.61","Global Peace Index":"","Democracy Index":"","Regime Type":"","Corruption Perceptions Index":"43","GDP per capita (current US$)":"3115","1":"2.20","1.1":"2.40","1.2":"2.00","2":"5.33"}],"1":"3.07","1.1":"2.98","1.1.1":"3.82","1.1.2":"2.39","1.1.3":"2.50","1.1.4":"2.54","1.1.5":"4.93","1.1.6":"2.07","1.1.7":"1.54","1.1.8":"2.93","1.1.9":"3.46","1.1.10":"3.57","1.2":"3.16","1.2.1":"1.54","1.2.2":"3.82","1.2.3":"3.14","1.2.4":"4.14","2":"5.46","2.1":"5.68","2.2":"5.43","2.3":"5.93","2.4":"6.18","2.5":"5.75","2.6":"5.79","2.7":"5.82","2.8":"5.29","2.9":"4.86","2.10":"4.29","2.11":"4.68","2.12":"5.79"}}
